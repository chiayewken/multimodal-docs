This process involves setting activations below a certain percentile to zero, which effectively focuses the model on the most significant features. The underlying principle that explains their performance advantage is that high activations correspond to high parameter gradients. By truncating low activations, ASH ensures that the model's predictions are more sensitive to the variations in the training data, making it easier to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution inputs. This method capitalizes on the fact that the gradients of the model with respect to its parameters are highly informative for OOD detection, as shown by recent empirical and theoretical studies.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[130,131,133,120,119,132,142,139,121,128,6,134,118,127,129,191,148,51,61,31,179,183,37,38,78,122,190,22,194,146,170,56,57,138,145,149,123,186,13,193,28,60,172,189,34,85,90,39,171,168,169,77,103,188,30,24,32,72,102,7,48,91,92,153,178,26,33,35,41,143,167,180,182,105,109,111,150,165,4,20,21,42,163,36,71,113,137,174,40,44,58,84,185,195,80,110,184,27,82,136,152,177,47,55,62,66,93,144,68,154,161,83,23,29,45,54,75,112,160,166,1,99,124,135,176,187,88,8,18,59,81,95,158,5,79,25,64,73,74,96,107,11,16,49,117,50,94,126,89,104,147,9,125,155,12,65,181,76,97,14,17,63,43,69,86,46,115,175,53,108,156,157,151,173,52,162,192,15,87,98,114,140,141,67,100,116,10,106,164,101,159,70,2,3,19],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle can lead to several safety risks. The vehicle's roof may not be designed to bear excessive weight, which can result in structural damage, compromising the vehicle's integrity. This could lead to roof collapse, potentially injuring passengers or causing cargo to fall, leading to accidents. Additionally, an unevenly distributed load can affect the vehicle's center of gravity, making it more prone to rollovers, especially at high speeds or during sharp turns.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to adhere to the specified weight limit for roof cargo, which is 100 kg (220 lbs.) for even distribution. Ensure that the load is evenly distributed across the roof rack to prevent any imbalance. Use appropriate roof rack equipment and secure the cargo firmly to prevent shifting or falling. Avoid placing heavy items on the roof if the vehicle is not equipped with a roof rack designed to handle such loads. Regularly inspect the roof rack and cargo for any signs of wear or damage, and always drive cautiously, especially in challenging road or weather conditions.","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[249,302,482,39,274,312,546,73,319,31,149,280,311,316,80,310,542,13,131,519,306,492,236,258,483,44,148,303,418,541,42,201,301,309,344,263,454,596,94,315,507,547,49,269,307,395,238,479,66,122,444,43,95,281,130,305,617,74,79,481,129,253,317,513,69,88,268,313,318,10,63,116,203,243,275,285,491,514,45,240,548,67,87,198,357,455,51,65,71,92,292,391,486,509,539,549,85,159,220,244,456,495,538,40,61,93,143,218,252,410,493,72,104,150,156,291,398,489,518,544,563,55,84,105,248,267,314,336,442,24,30,48,83,133,283,290,350,390,452,476,494,545,558,7,11,41,111,125,141,183,211,296,400,425,429,578,32,36,90,151,289,293,393,475,485,614,86,175,192,261,304,590,70,147,242,308,618,52,64,110,246,265,327,337,352,91,102,270,349,412,457,565,35,68,155,204,212,427,446,478,570,585,586,8,123,137,196,297,342,468,506,537,584,17,53,181,227,230,351,355,359,423,571,81,219,341,420,37,108,127,282,472,499,521,572,9,23,234,295,445,461,54,56,103,114,247,260,273,330,335,419,467,616,12,29,33,144,146,262,430,526,28,46,57,135,166,241,255,294,324,326,333,356,358,413,451,470,560,561,58,134,200,228,232,251,325,415,473,474,508,532,533,615,3,107,205,362,428,440,490,59,213,366,424,527,82,142,145,158,233,286,339,367,530,552,564,573,199,371,374,381,414,453,480,577,579,613,76,132,138,161,165,299,361,363,372,543,555,587,157,162,194,237,354,380,465,554,47,75,124,152,195,197,284,360,365,394,435,463,471,575,38,98,189,193,458,528,553,106,128,209,259,264,345,385,417,431,441,466,525,50,185,208,271,343,524,153,154,223,331,397,477,557,569,589,598,16,34,60,89,117,184,215,332,411,551,595,97,113,300,383,396,406,448,531,534,535,550,26,27,160,408,556,112,115,364,416,520,574,62,119,266,272,276,288,402,422,433,503,540,599,109,182,239,254,329,369,469,522,576,188,328,340,386,421,484,529,593,609,78,179,225,277,399,426,121,338,379,392,401,77,177,186,206,278,334,370,387,405,443,568,99,171,377,436,459,464,515,523,298,403,432,488,18,384,388,487,517,608,100,120,163,174,190,217,348,368,597,126,178,210,226,323,437,176,229,376,450,612,222,224,373,382,536,1,25,118,136,139,231,287,404,245,566,581,216,257,279,347,375,434,449,498,378,594,180,511,600,605,191,580,592,167,221,438,439,496,559,346,389,407,447,582,172,202,321,173,214,168,170,187,207,583,21,235,353,504,505,567,601,604,20,22,250,462,502,501,460,497,101,169,2,4,6,19,96,256,320,512,562,588,606,610,620,15,164,611,140,500,603,409,602,322,5,516,619,14,591,510,607],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The significant increase in borrowings (from US$ 497,642,000 in 2022 to US$ 500,981,000 in 2023) is a notable factor contributing to this rise. This increase in financial liabilities suggests that the company may be adopting a more leveraged financial strategy, potentially to fund expansion or other capital-intensive projects. However, it also indicates a higher level of financial risk and the need for effective management of debt to ensure the company's financial health and compliance with its debt covenants.","source":"data/test/NYSE_GPRK_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[204,205,186,107,180,196,206,218,183,24,176,210,108,170,23,27,116,198,106,127,45,207,222,184,171,174,147,173,12,41,103,119,163,192,35,113,115,181,185,55,154,165,11,21,31,168,169,188,189,224,20,152,211,231,61,79,118,178,209,220,246,22,104,117,120,160,230,36,39,135,137,145,175,179,191,197,225,18,51,121,208,105,153,161,40,88,95,109,26,111,214,66,199,249,167,172,60,64,151,223,114,125,193,38,70,134,80,158,213,46,62,219,67,177,200,212,227,32,71,17,57,142,187,93,126,228,232,29,63,162,164,166,195,42,77,241,34,56,73,112,226,25,30,54,194,242,33,37,69,102,130,143,190,215,229,50,53,248,59,97,250,49,76,91,131,182,90,129,221,16,81,122,146,217,44,78,240,253,10,68,3,13,19,43,48,157,251,15,75,58,110,4,14,86,233,247,150,236,243,89,92,99,149,239,252,28,96,98,201,203,257,259,133,244,74,132,65,87,128,83,216,100,139,141,235,256,138,85,5,72,84,124,156,144,148,245,255,101,1,2,8,136,237,52,155,254,47,258,140,123,234,238,202,82,159,260,9,6,94,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Explain the key differences in the trends shown by these two graphs.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[58],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between reference length percentile and the percentage of empty modes indicates that as the length of the reference sentences increases, the percentage of examples for which the model predicts the empty sequence as the mode also increases. This trend suggests that longer source sentences are more likely to have empty modes. In contrast, the relationship between reference sentence length percentile and the probability of empty context shows that the probability of the model generating an empty sequence given the input does not exhibit a clear correlation with the length of the reference sentences. Instead, the probability of the empty sequence remains relatively stable across different length percentiles.\n\nThe key difference lies in the nature of the metrics being analyzed. The percentage of empty modes reflects the proportion of source sentences for which the model predicts the empty sequence as the most likely output, indicating a qualitative shift in the model's predictions with increasing sentence length. On the other hand, the probability of empty context measures the model's likelihood of generating an empty sequence given a specific input, which does not show a strong dependency on the length of the input sentences. This distinction highlights that while the model's tendency to produce empty sequences may increase with sentence length, the likelihood of generating an empty sequence for a given input does not follow a similar trend.","source":"data/test/2408.16241.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[60,55,58,57,71,6,61,49,101,44,25,54,103,56,59,47,94,99,4,8,91,62,24,92,68,39,7,63,80,112,114,95,32,93,53,45,65,75,109,115,31,102,104,64,98,40,51,72,100,67,79,107,113,42,70,66,43,46,22,52,69,30,96,87,12,48,89,111,90,106,116,50,19,23,118,105,76,83,86,110,5,13,85,88,15,3,82,84,108,17,21,78,97,36,37,11,26,27,77,16,18,41,74,20,34,117,28,14,35,33,2,38,10,29,73,9,81,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The AGGREGATE function determines how information is combined from neighboring vertices, affecting the flow and complexity of interactions.\n\nUsing a product aggregation operator, where the AGGREGATE function is the Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication), allows the GNN to model more complex interactions. This is because the product operation can capture non-linear relationships and dependencies between features of neighboring vertices. As a result, the GNN can better represent intricate patterns and interactions within the graph data.\n\nTheoretically, GNNs with product aggregation can be formulated as tensor networks, which provides a framework for analyzing their expressive power. This formulation shows that the separation rank—a measure of modeled interaction—is influenced by the graph's structure and the network's architecture. Specifically, the separation rank is capped by the number of walks between partitions of vertices, indicating the extent to which interactions are modeled.\n\nIn practical terms, using product aggregation can lead to more accurate and robust models, especially in scenarios where complex interactions are crucial.

However, their ability to capture real-world election characteristics varies. For instance, models like IC and IAC assume uniform randomness, which may not align with the structured preferences seen in real elections. Real-world data often exhibit specific patterns, such as the presence of universally supported candidates or cohesive voter groups, which are less common in synthetic data.\n\nThis discrepancy implies that while statistical cultures are useful for theoretical analysis and understanding basic election dynamics, they may not fully capture the complexity of real elections. Consequently, the design and evaluation of proportional voting rules should consider both synthetic and real-world data. Rules tested on diverse statistical cultures can identify general performance trends, but validation against real-election data ensures practical applicability and robustness. This dual approach helps in creating voting systems that are both theoretically sound and empirically effective.","source":"data/test/2407.11889.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[170,15,84,154,27,150,5,39,14,11,85,123,18,79,82,161,8,95,151,197,57,175,126,157,165,19,6,54,58,172,144,152,125,35,122,147,53,109,16,120,171,190,68,113,117,146,189,13,17,105,191,55,141,193,102,119,192,12,173,9,160,36,104,156,164,174,118,166,67,69,99,100,115,56,65,185,40,111,140,34,43,81,83,114,70,71,96,142,153,97,107,112,41,49,50,66,90,149,98,124,162,7,10,28,33,45,20,29,88,155,194,23,51,59,72,78,195,196,3,37,42,62,188,38,74,86,1,76,93,103,127,132,143,148,52,60,108,30,91,92,94,168,184,44,47,61,121,134,163,21,22,48,63,64,46,32,24,133,138,136,135,130,167,186,129,159,187,101,116,128,158,131,145,2,4,169,176,31,75,139,89,25,137,110,87,106,80,178,183,26,179,181,73,77,177,180,182],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The table shows that the standard deviation of the gyroscope noise (σ𝜔) is significantly higher (1.69e-4 rad/s√Hz) compared to the accelerometer noise (σa, 0.002 m/s2√Hz). Gyroscope noise directly affects the measurement of angular velocity, which is crucial for determining orientation. High gyroscope noise can lead to rapid accumulation of errors in orientation estimates over time, a phenomenon known as \"drift.\" Reducing gyroscope noise would therefore help mitigate these drift errors, leading to more accurate and stable orientation estimates. While accelerometer noise also impacts the system, its effect is generally less pronounced on orientation over short periods due to the integration required to convert acceleration into velocity and position. Thus, focusing on reducing gyroscope noise would yield more significant improvements in orientation accuracy.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[107,121,109,141,50,197,131,49,106,193,70,130,129,55,127,68,198,24,211,57,137,142,67,122,196,138,140,200,58,169,194,51,123,132,89,93,163,116,199,64,133,146,59,105,134,20,41,71,104,115,99,173,181,5,56,128,48,63,77,135,195,206,42,82,143,201,207,69,202,18,40,190,15,66,110,164,4,139,148,192,62,96,176,124,191,43,53,117,144,168,136,108,147,165,177,6,76,223,209,16,21,44,98,118,179,14,60,95,114,11,22,54,83,86,111,171,23,31,178,205,175,9,94,119,151,39,125,180,19,45,153,174,222,75,220,74,213,218,13,26,38,170,172,204,219,25,72,120,160,17,65,90,113,166,215,224,37,61,79,183,208,10,103,30,87,149,185,216,47,101,155,167,212,81,184,217,100,126,145,150,161,8,32,52,189,88,102,154,221,29,182,214,152,203,46,162,34,73,92,186,35,36,84,112,159,188,78,158,210,97,80,85,157,187,33,225,91,156,27,12,28,3,7,1,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"How might the dual-class stock structure and the Smith Family's voting trust agreement impact the ability of minority shareholders to influence significant corporate decisions, and what potential risks or benefits does this structure present for the company as a whole?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[16],"raw_output":"","pred":"The dual-class stock structure and the Smith Family's voting trust agreement significantly impact the ability of minority shareholders to influence corporate decisions. With Class A Common Stock holders having one vote per share and Common Stock holders having one-tenth of one vote per share, the Smith Family controls approximately 96.9% of the voting power of Class A Common Stock and 66.2% of the total voting power. This concentration of voting rights allows the Smith Family to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, such as changes to the certificate of incorporation or transactions involving a change of control. This structure limits the influence of minority shareholders, potentially reducing their ability to affect significant corporate decisions.\n\nThe primary risk of this structure is the potential for minority shareholders to feel disenfranchised, which could lead to decreased investor confidence and liquidity issues. Additionally, it may hinder the company's ability to attract new investors who prefer a more equitable voting structure.\n\nHowever, the structure also presents benefits, such as stability and continuity in leadership and strategic direction. The Smith Family's long-term commitment and control can provide a consistent vision and help avoid the short-term pressures that can arise from frequent changes in leadership or strategy. This stability can be particularly beneficial in industries with long-term strategic planning and significant capital investments.\n\nOverall, while the dual-class stock structure and voting trust agreement offer certain advantages in terms of stability and long-term vision, they also present risks related to minority shareholder influence and potential investor concerns.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AOS_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[16,13,12,30,31,40,11,3,6,15,32,14,21,47,66,56,41,69,64,4,10,74,75,38,43,55,62,48,51,60,39,59,65,68,82,83,27,8,73,18,5,23,9,25,7,24,28,33,37,46,2,19,54,50,63,81,26,34,57,45,29,42,58,67,52,72,35,61,17,70,53,49,44,76,71,77,22,78,79,80,1,36,84,20],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

For instance, using orthogonal coding matrices ensures that mating pairs (local criterion) attract strongly in one specific configuration while remaining agnostic in other translations and rotations. This can be adapted to other encoding schemes like optical or chemical coding by designing patterns that enforce similar selective attraction rules.\n\nHowever, different encoding schemes come with their own trade-offs. Magnetic encoding benefits from strong, long-range forces and re-programmability but may suffer from complexity in fabrication and control. Optical or chemical encoding, on the other hand, might be simpler to implement but could lack the robustness and range of magnetic interactions. Additionally, the choice of encoding scheme affects the scalability and cost of the system. Magnetic modules, while versatile, can be expensive and require specialized equipment for programming. In contrast, optical or chemical systems might be cheaper but may not scale as well due to limitations in pattern complexity and resolution.\n\nUltimately, the choice of encoding scheme depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the need for reconfigurability, the complexity of the target structures, and the available resources for fabrication and control.

Hearing aids are designed to enhance sound quality and reduce background noise, but they can sometimes pick up interference from the phone itself. By holding the phone at different angles or moving it slightly away from your ear, you can minimize the direct transmission of the phone's electromagnetic signals to the hearing aids, which can cause feedback or distortion. Additionally, repositioning the phone allows you to find the optimal spot where the sound is clearest and most comfortable, reducing the strain on your ears.

{"question":"How does the concept of diagonal translation equivariance (DTE) differ from general (X × X)-translation equivariance, and what is the significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[82],"raw_output":"","pred":"Diagonal translation equivariance (DTE) differs from general (X × X)-translation equivariance in that DTE only requires the function to be equivariant with respect to translations along the diagonal of the space X × X. This means that for DTE, a function π must satisfy π ∘ T(τ, τ) = T(τ, τ) ∘ π for all τ ∈ X, whereas general (X × X)-translation equivariance requires the function to be equivariant for all translations T(τ1, τ2) on X × X.\n\nThe significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9 lies in the ability to leverage the structure of DTE to approximate (X × X)-translation equivariance. By defining πdup(a) := π(a, a) for all a ∈ A, we create a function that is naturally equivariant with respect to diagonal translations. This allows us to apply Theorem 4.8, which characterizes (X × X)-translation equivariant functions, to derive a characterization of DTE functions.

For instance, a user could label a set of medication bottles with their respective contents, making it easier to identify and manage medication without relying solely on text labels or braille.\n\nHowever, there are some potential limitations. First, the effectiveness of voice labels depends on the accuracy of the recordings and the user's ability to position the device correctly over the label. Misalignment could lead to incorrect readings. Additionally, voice labels require NFC (Near Field Communication) capability, which may not be available on all devices. Lastly, managing and maintaining voice labels can be time-consuming, especially for users with large numbers of items to label.\n\nIn summary, while voice labels can greatly enhance the accessibility of TalkBack by providing more detailed and context-specific information, their practical application is subject to certain technical and usability constraints.","source":"data/test/sms921w.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[189,191,190,184,92,167,131,185,186,98,188,195,79,3,94,2,57,58,101,168,208,141,166,50,198,23,70,85,187,93,120,144,178,83,115,123,129,155,193,35,44,46,97,125,80,122,192,216,38,78,103,102,109,149,173,11,12,51,74,84,148,17,95,104,111,112,121,171,174,217,36,82,147,7,9,28,37,64,91,105,128,140,146,209,211,15,20,108,133,153,160,176,180,181,31,55,69,72,119,4,5,77,219,39,177,179,201,213,18,25,53,61,67,89,107,118,132,196,206,210,212,26,68,81,86,114,124,130,136,137,154,169,197,27,60,75,135,203,215,14,30,43,99,134,157,164,54,65,142,150,194,202,47,52,56,63,16,29,33,40,48,62,138,175,24,34,49,66,73,96,106,161,200,205,22,42,88,116,163,165,199,117,139,151,172,59,87,113,152,19,32,41,45,76,110,182,218,156,207,13,71,170,1,127,158,159,183,204,214,126,143,145,100,6,21,162,10,90,8],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This step is crucial as it lays the foundation for the circuit design, ensuring that all necessary electronic elements are included in the initial design phase.\n\n2. **Circuit Tracing Section (b)**: Here, users can draw circuit traces to connect the electronic components. The traces are color-coded in green for differentiation and are designed to snap to 0/90° for cleaner fabrication. This tool ensures that the electrical connections between components are accurately represented, facilitating the proper functioning of the device.\n\n3. **Geometry Drawing Tools Section (c)**: This section includes tools for defining the physical structure of the device. Users can draw cut lines (red) and bend lines (cyan) to specify where the material should be cut and folded. The 'anchor' tool is used to designate sections that remain planar during bending, ensuring the structural integrity of the device. This step is essential for creating the 2D or 3D geometry of the device.\n\n4. **Export Tools Section (d)**: The final section includes tools for exporting the design. Once the design is complete, this tool converts the design file into machine instructions that the augmented laser cutter can understand. This step is critical as it translates the user's design into a format that can be executed by the fabrication hardware, ensuring that the device is manufactured according to the specified design.\n\nEach section of the toolbar plays a vital role in the design and fabrication process, from selecting components and drawing circuit traces to defining the geometry and exporting the design.

This method primarily tests the model's visual recognition capabilities rather than its semantic understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Visual-based Combination\" merges adjacent characters into a single character, which can sometimes alter the meaning by creating a new visual representation. For instance, combining \"E\" and \"A\" into \"Eam\" changes the word \"Earn\" into \"Eam,\" which is not a recognizable word. This method directly impacts the semantic interpretation of the text, as the combined character may not convey the original meaning, thus challenging the model's ability to understand and process the text accurately.\n\nIn summary, \"Visual-based Splitting\" focuses on altering the visual structure without necessarily affecting the meaning, while \"Visual-based Combination\" merges characters to potentially change the semantic content, thereby impacting how the text is understood.","source":"data/test/2409.00551.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[103,102,108,107,116,114,113,106,214,203,24,119,19,68,177,150,118,56,209,117,135,188,196,63,176,70,28,33,109,120,169,221,36,115,148,179,45,211,183,187,147,190,200,17,18,84,129,180,4,64,89,134,175,62,140,154,159,204,51,98,170,58,90,158,178,104,61,93,26,57,145,217,35,67,72,48,52,111,171,213,59,127,210,38,43,53,46,66,69,121,124,149,195,34,42,143,164,182,219,105,13,82,181,192,73,96,139,142,197,12,87,99,205,3,31,101,133,136,151,152,194,65,71,74,81,125,130,201,27,41,110,137,144,168,44,97,172,222,157,184,206,223,77,80,92,174,189,198,218,5,22,25,123,126,132,153,186,6,100,166,191,16,60,167,207,15,37,212,112,173,50,83,54,79,128,161,30,47,85,86,141,160,165,215,155,193,163,202,7,199,75,78,138,23,88,29,146,156,208,10,91,131,220,11,39,40,76,94,216,21,185,9,20,162,55,14,122,1,32,49,8,95,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This can affect the driver's experience by momentarily reducing vehicle speed or stopping the vehicle, which is essential for avoiding collisions and maintaining control of the vehicle.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[180,479,581,580,217,184,79,216,502,311,354,214,342,477,192,241,288,309,245,301,266,486,296,346,484,77,78,307,356,273,571,578,38,181,353,3,268,341,359,471,177,215,339,494,340,357,355,492,235,263,324,344,347,567,570,276,485,487,271,361,365,569,22,283,338,209,308,7,137,246,267,299,304,445,495,501,185,257,490,527,579,4,183,259,446,572,213,222,248,249,275,165,200,205,208,350,16,219,220,250,252,282,298,303,316,358,428,236,280,318,345,491,576,204,274,310,312,325,348,116,182,191,195,260,277,328,349,515,548,469,493,27,127,134,203,242,258,272,331,336,337,343,371,507,543,573,592,89,130,194,207,278,289,300,432,464,2,10,46,90,129,133,333,370,476,483,506,510,74,87,94,178,193,313,422,73,132,179,186,232,234,262,323,332,441,478,546,68,119,211,247,319,430,473,503,562,218,221,240,256,321,351,420,542,547,563,70,155,253,281,317,326,41,61,95,139,198,251,265,290,305,363,375,421,544,91,118,128,166,168,254,284,285,287,302,334,335,429,440,447,456,497,552,566,590,111,136,223,297,314,577,6,30,56,60,72,105,117,125,199,202,233,243,292,294,369,451,574,12,57,101,126,131,142,210,229,293,315,352,373,374,392,452,482,545,575,92,98,110,201,322,403,509,1,69,82,93,103,123,138,279,291,306,320,330,360,404,438,439,449,453,458,475,480,489,40,45,122,140,151,158,170,244,255,368,372,405,472,504,523,549,551,102,149,156,163,176,226,327,378,481,550,33,49,65,71,96,164,169,174,230,239,329,381,402,457,462,531,8,14,44,52,76,100,135,153,172,380,382,408,426,450,536,564,591,21,115,152,171,383,436,474,512,561,47,48,51,59,86,109,196,206,269,286,385,391,397,406,427,460,513,19,36,97,112,121,124,159,162,270,412,431,522,538,55,106,120,188,225,261,470,526,532,80,81,264,362,364,514,9,104,114,411,560,589,20,32,42,43,99,161,175,238,377,212,387,433,468,541,582,584,11,25,50,228,367,444,454,508,540,596,35,83,295,379,401,467,511,594,85,150,366,376,400,409,415,419,448,37,67,173,231,384,395,424,5,18,31,58,84,160,463,520,197,237,398,399,435,559,593,598,62,141,190,227,407,443,535,28,29,63,64,167,388,521,583,587,15,154,413,437,461,539,556,66,386,390,416,496,500,517,537,39,144,148,224,423,459,524,558,53,189,505,519,534,107,113,145,414,498,143,417,425,442,455,88,393,396,530,24,23,389,488,147,13,466,157,553,518,410,418,465,34,533,499,557,595,75,187,108,434,525,586,529,568,555,588,597,528,146,394,565,585,26,54,554,516,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"Explain why cloning your computer's MAC address to your router might be necessary when using a cable modem for internet access, and describe the potential issue that could arise if the router's default LAN IP address conflicts with your existing modem/router.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[105],"raw_output":"","pred":"Cloning your computer's MAC address to your router might be necessary when using a cable modem for internet access because Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often register the MAC address of the initial device that connects to their network. This registration process ensures that only authorized devices can access the internet. If you introduce a router into the network, the ISP may not recognize the new MAC address of the router, leading to a loss of internet connectivity. By cloning your computer's MAC address, you essentially mimic the original device that was registered with the ISP, thereby maintaining internet access.\n\nAdditionally, the default LAN IP address of many routers, such as 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1, may conflict with the IP range of an existing modem/router. This conflict can prevent the router from communicating with the modem, resulting in no internet access. To avoid this issue, it is crucial to change the router's LAN IP address to a unique value within a different subnet, such as 192.168.2.1. This change ensures that the router and modem can operate on separate subnets without IP conflicts, thereby facilitating proper communication and internet connectivity.","source":"data/test/archer_ax21.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[105,104,18,12,72,19,15,75,101,106,53,57,103,9,54,77,60,61,27,93,107,17,40,65,74,87,92,21,29,58,64,73,69,13,24,55,90,28,108,78,22,38,49,44,56,91,51,98,66,109,25,37,46,3,5,52,59,62,82,88,89,68,26,67,23,63,83,96,2,76,86,94,79,16,35,39,50,102,36,97,6,33,32,20,41,99,110,84,100,31,80,81,111,4,85,95,71,11,8,14,34,112,10,45,43,47,30,70,7,1,48,42],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

These errors often stem from the model using incorrect predicates or generating new, unnecessary predicates that do not align with the ground truth. In contrast, when GPT-4 successfully generates a good plan, it does so in 2 instances for good actions and 3 instances for good plans. This indicates that while GPT-4 can sometimes produce correct action definitions and plans, it frequently struggles with accurately predicting preconditions and effects, leading to errors that prevent the solver from finding a valid plan.

Concurrently, the percentage of Assets Under Management (AUM) engaged in public equity also saw a notable rise, from no reported percentage in 2018 and 2019 to 71% in 2020, 78% in 2021, and 85% in 2022.\n\nThis trend indicates a growing emphasis on ESG factors and active ownership within the company's investment strategy. The increase in engagement meetings suggests a proactive approach to influencing corporate behavior and addressing ESG-related issues. The rise in AUM engagement for public equity further supports this, showing that more of the firm's assets are being managed with a focus on ESG considerations. These trends imply that Neuberger Berman is strengthening its commitment to ESG integration, which can lead to better risk management, improved corporate governance, and potentially higher long-term returns for clients. Additionally, enhanced ESG engagement can bolster the firm's reputation as a responsible investor, attracting more clients who prioritize sustainability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NHS_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[52,35,28,48,55,49,10,5,6,11,36,39,63,13,53,4,8,30,54,2,42,45,56,29,9,14,44,17,16,24,34,60,46,31,25,57,20,23,37,47,62,21,3,33,7,43,61,22,32,38,15,64,58,12,41,50,59,40,1,18,26,27,51,19],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The text suggests that these measures may not be sufficiently sensitive to slight variations in model performance, particularly in tasks with inherently difficult generalization (e.g., Tasks 7 and 8). This limitation implies that margin-based measures might struggle to distinguish between models with similar generalization capabilities, making them less useful in scenarios where fine-grained predictions are necessary.\n\nThis limitation is relevant to the field of adversarial examples because adversarial perturbations are designed to exploit the vulnerabilities in a model's decision boundaries. If margin-based measures are not sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in model robustness, they may fail to predict how a model will perform against adversarial attacks. Consequently, understanding and mitigating the limitations of margin-based measures could improve both generalization prediction and the resilience of DNNs to adversarial examples.","source":"data/test/2405.17445.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[123,17,143,16,19,3,145,6,4,78,34,22,32,73,104,31,18,46,139,103,12,35,101,136,7,131,132,140,146,5,20,25,44,70,135,26,144,147,29,71,83,80,120,137,30,36,84,110,111,41,81,24,28,138,47,124,99,79,27,33,150,21,42,45,82,100,23,114,39,141,40,112,113,148,149,66,122,77,105,98,13,64,10,130,37,97,119,142,69,49,95,43,48,76,118,11,60,116,72,96,125,161,38,55,15,94,63,102,158,53,54,121,1,9,52,107,153,155,59,62,92,117,88,50,157,68,74,106,160,162,58,65,67,115,156,51,61,87,91,163,108,154,56,8,90,75,109,159,86,93,126,57,129,89,152,165,127,85,151,134,128,14,164,2,133],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

This can result in system unbootability, data loss, and the need for professional intervention, which can be time-consuming and costly.\n\nTo mitigate these consequences, it is essential to ensure that the correct device is set as the first boot option. Before making changes, verify the device you intend to boot from, such as a USB drive containing the operating system installation files. Additionally, always double-check the boot order settings after making changes and before restarting the computer. If the system still fails to boot from the intended device, re-enable Secure Boot and try again, ensuring to re-enable it after the operating system installation is complete.

This volatility may prompt Dril-Quip to diversify its product offerings and invest more heavily in CCUS technologies to hedge against price uncertainties. \n\nSecondly, the global push for sustainability and the transition to cleaner energy sources will likely increase scrutiny on Dril-Quip's ESG practices. To meet investor and regulatory expectations, Dril-Quip may need to form strategic partnerships with companies specializing in renewable energy and CCUS. These collaborations can enhance the company's reputation and provide access to new markets and technologies.\n\nMoreover, the geopolitical environment may influence government policies and regulations, potentially favoring CCUS projects as a means to reduce carbon emissions.

{"question":"What are the differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds between the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter in still photo shooting, and how do these settings impact the use of flash?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[908],"raw_output":"","pred":"In still photo shooting, the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter have different settings for shutter speed and X-sync speed, which impact the use of flash.\n\nThe mechanical shutter has a setting range of 1/4000 to 30 seconds, including Bulb, with a maximum X-sync speed of 1/200 sec. This means it can synchronize with the flash at slower speeds, allowing for more flexibility in low-light conditions. However, it may introduce some motion blur due to the mechanical movement of the shutter.\n\nThe electronic 1st curtain shutter also has a range of 1/4000 to 30 seconds, including Bulb, but with a higher maximum X-sync speed of 1/250 sec. This faster sync speed reduces motion blur and is more effective for freezing action. However, it may not be as effective in very low light since it cannot synchronize with the flash at slower speeds.\n\nFor flash photography, the mechanical shutter allows for high-speed sync in <P> or <Av> mode up to 1/200 sec., while the electronic 1st curtain shutter allows it up to 1/250 sec. This difference means that the electronic 1st curtain shutter provides more flexibility for using flash in brighter conditions or with faster shutter speeds. However, in low-light conditions, the mechanical shutter might be more suitable due to its ability to synchronize at slower speeds.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[908,161,162,910,174,177,298,299,170,869,164,384,163,344,870,179,500,868,165,499,150,286,218,181,291,894,899,293,3,294,296,887,4,224,905,906,184,223,297,874,195,339,147,826,116,152,204,132,172,336,417,825,840,131,144,312,681,135,502,113,157,387,688,830,833,838,867,892,133,145,173,180,313,388,75,156,212,167,215,308,185,301,348,350,904,137,140,338,349,72,74,176,96,159,199,219,269,432,791,824,837,885,206,821,898,149,380,849,122,130,143,155,295,352,818,909,5,115,136,300,335,102,211,503,843,57,175,198,221,316,345,871,913,50,168,205,333,828,886,889,891,114,134,169,253,138,171,376,872,151,318,395,83,202,213,226,282,337,434,829,77,119,139,158,207,216,407,35,285,394,726,127,178,355,382,460,835,153,186,209,343,393,405,633,112,182,214,274,341,367,392,739,183,200,266,76,81,94,277,278,281,836,91,324,386,419,492,795,832,20,193,275,381,383,841,290,303,442,596,630,2,89,187,210,486,615,789,839,34,80,95,188,228,241,248,262,307,311,317,323,374,437,469,866,106,121,203,267,268,276,391,471,787,806,33,90,107,120,148,160,217,321,418,732,817,897,31,87,92,98,192,231,279,280,707,93,97,100,283,284,496,700,822,108,146,190,334,340,875,32,104,189,232,314,385,433,446,458,501,808,110,287,406,429,454,476,508,888,99,124,166,257,330,342,411,450,459,485,541,579,7,85,239,420,489,28,264,320,487,616,8,73,105,117,118,390,641,763,842,884,18,225,265,315,463,488,807,834,878,61,70,84,103,288,322,474,493,504,674,809,6,17,123,194,201,230,252,309,326,328,438,447,509,511,661,788,907,67,208,449,738,810,863,880,25,78,451,786,815,877,254,365,366,416,436,445,587,624,666,895,26,42,111,443,475,675,733,758,760,38,109,222,234,235,260,423,428,430,461,512,519,537,557,590,725,794,54,101,196,242,261,271,289,319,331,864,914,86,129,351,507,577,585,653,659,59,125,233,247,258,378,422,431,481,667,697,711,762,812,823,126,236,246,306,346,353,531,544,197,396,468,483,540,621,628,844,858,82,237,368,371,441,505,873,240,372,373,421,425,426,455,497,792,27,154,229,347,424,453,631,636,642,677,698,71,88,227,238,245,305,327,332,427,477,597,614,663,737,896,244,250,357,413,495,612,651,715,816,820,854,325,401,440,467,498,543,607,632,695,736,800,802,354,400,457,464,568,618,669,671,673,742,778,790,797,9,142,369,479,480,526,528,529,539,583,634,660,679,734,798,805,911,60,220,259,439,466,708,743,65,255,270,272,273,359,482,538,640,683,689,705,717,718,727,783,304,399,402,462,470,490,513,514,516,527,534,542,582,603,617,620,622,645,676,703,710,714,752,776,22,364,409,452,465,472,494,520,545,561,576,588,602,662,709,735,744,745,793,819,52,403,525,535,604,649,650,657,685,690,721,755,761,861,912,79,243,398,518,532,567,601,639,652,654,682,731,30,128,478,484,510,572,600,629,648,655,680,722,764,777,21,51,63,435,448,536,562,635,701,704,712,741,766,801,902,916,251,444,560,605,637,706,730,782,785,827,883,16,191,414,558,569,608,647,658,672,699,740,813,881,45,46,62,404,523,625,696,724,831,862,893,903,19,24,360,379,491,552,686,694,719,723,751,767,846,853,855,900,10,44,64,370,410,456,584,586,609,665,670,720,746,753,799,901,36,292,329,412,524,613,729,771,40,69,408,415,473,549,578,589,716,775,780,796,851,310,517,565,573,598,623,643,656,687,693,702,748,749,754,768,804,23,43,47,49,515,547,556,559,591,362,522,530,551,553,570,574,575,592,610,668,249,377,521,580,581,664,678,747,857,859,141,550,611,644,692,781,845,11,15,58,68,619,765,784,865,1,56,571,546,564,594,595,713,848,256,506,533,554,599,684,750,779,860,66,356,626,774,847,850,555,691,856,263,375,563,890,29,358,361,728,772,548,593,606,757,759,876,53,566,769,770,773,882,389,646,37,39,811,879,915,919,852,302,756,41,14,917,397,814,627,48,13,363,803,12,55,638,918],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What are the key differences and potential advantages of using white-box analysis over machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems, as discussed by Velez et al. (2021)?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[256],"raw_output":"","pred":"Velez et al. (2021) highlight key differences and potential advantages of using white-box analysis over machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems. White-box analysis involves understanding and analyzing the internal states and code structure of software, often using techniques like queuing networks and dynamic taint analysis. This approach provides transparency and interpretability, allowing for a clear understanding of how performance is influenced by various factors. In contrast, machine learning models are typically black-box, making it difficult to interpret the relationships between inputs and outputs.\n\nThe primary advantage of white-box analysis is its interpretability, which is crucial for debugging and optimizing software performance. It allows developers to pinpoint specific areas of the code that affect performance, enabling targeted improvements. Additionally, white-box models can be more accurate in scenarios where the software's internal workings are well-understood, as they rely on precise theoretical models.\n\nHowever, white-box analysis requires full access to the software's internal states, which may not always be feasible. It is also often limited to specific performance metrics, such as runtime and latency, due to theoretical assumptions or measurement tool limitations. Machine learning models, on the other hand, can handle a broader range of performance metrics and are more adaptable to different environments, making them suitable for complex and dynamic systems.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[256,211,242,173,212,122,172,23,177,176,180,103,191,86,102,214,96,117,95,258,130,193,251,239,178,209,243,99,19,58,74,101,128,250,132,22,59,231,240,129,65,210,234,40,51,100,213,87,56,85,104,229,246,253,60,61,260,237,144,232,235,245,255,31,151,254,257,54,119,179,236,18,20,45,79,90,157,247,52,55,69,125,148,230,244,53,57,75,116,261,76,94,155,249,63,64,105,123,134,80,67,83,106,127,146,238,2,26,32,72,78,81,88,140,203,223,112,241,49,126,169,204,259,12,68,115,136,252,43,62,66,77,215,248,8,70,84,111,174,200,21,48,156,170,71,124,147,9,29,33,150,166,3,7,168,195,25,98,207,233,14,37,143,153,121,189,192,197,5,208,222,224,82,113,152,199,225,227,92,110,137,139,161,220,226,30,44,50,97,108,202,47,131,145,186,194,114,142,163,167,175,228,107,109,120,149,184,188,41,185,11,15,133,138,162,165,190,263,91,24,181,196,274,13,118,154,158,160,217,73,135,164,264,27,39,42,89,201,159,46,187,28,183,216,218,221,6,171,93,182,35,198,141,206,267,273,205,1,219,266,271,4,262,38,265,36,272,16,269,268,10,34,270,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The VanEck OIH Index, which tracks oil and natural gas services, experienced significant volatility, reflecting the fluctuations in the energy sector. Dril-Quip, Inc. demonstrated a recovery trend, particularly notable after 2020, aligning with the broader economic recovery and increased energy demand. However, Dril-Quip's performance was more volatile compared to the S&P 500 but showed resilience in the face of energy market fluctuations. Overall, the S&P 500 displayed the most consistent growth, while Dril-Quip's performance was characterized by recovery and adaptation to the energy market dynamics.","source":"data/test/NYSE_DRQ_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[36,8,13,52,11,60,87,6,65,86,55,56,58,20,1,38,12,57,85,81,40,59,48,80,15,9,39,89,23,79,25,82,42,67,24,74,19,21,14,71,49,7,43,16,84,75,10,17,44,46,77,5,66,26,50,76,78,4,31,51,62,69,41,63,83,33,53,29,64,27,45,35,18,70,68,72,30,47,61,22,91,92,54,28,73,2,3,32,34,88,37,90],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This trend is evident from the gradual rise in these metrics as the batch size increases. The tracking error and acceleration metrics show a minor increase from 800 to 1000 batches, suggesting that larger batch sizes may necessitate more detours to ensure collision-free trajectories, thereby increasing both tracking error and acceleration. However, the increase is marginal, indicating that the optimizer's performance remains relatively stable even with larger batch sizes.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[66,65,67,94,75,57,26,63,52,46,64,53,93,12,19,81,82,83,56,8,95,10,100,49,14,61,54,68,98,101,55,92,90,27,47,60,44,18,37,20,48,96,77,91,71,85,78,29,43,50,6,17,32,35,70,76,80,110,34,99,89,102,103,79,87,107,45,69,41,59,84,42,24,2,112,7,30,11,31,74,86,33,15,51,58,21,62,106,38,72,28,23,25,104,108,36,39,109,88,73,13,16,97,105,40,3,9,22,5,111,4,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

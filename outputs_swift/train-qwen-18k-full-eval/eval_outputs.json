{"question":"Explain how the different types of sensors (propagation, update, and joint sensors) contribute to the navigation and state estimation of a heterogeneous swarm of agents, as depicted in the provided figure. Discuss the potential challenges and benefits of integrating these sensors in a distributed multi-agent system.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[24],"raw_output":"","pred":"The figure illustrates a heterogeneous swarm of agents equipped with various types of sensors to enhance navigation and state estimation. Propagation sensors, such as the IMU, provide continuous measurements of the agent's motion, enabling a basic dead-reckoning capability. However, this method is prone to drift over time. Update sensors, including cameras, GNSS, magnetometers, and barometers, offer more accurate and reliable data by directly measuring the agent's position and orientation relative to the environment. These sensors help correct the drift introduced by the propagation sensors, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the state estimation.\n\nJoint sensors, such as relative pose and range/bearing sensors, allow agents to share information about their positions and orientations with respect to each other. This inter-agent communication is crucial for refining the estimates and maintaining accurate relative positions, which is essential for coordinated tasks and avoiding collisions.\n\nThe integration of these sensors in a distributed multi-agent system presents several challenges. The heterogeneity of the agents and the varying sensor configurations can lead to inconsistencies in data quality and reliability. Additionally, the communication infrastructure must be robust enough to handle the diverse types of data and ensure timely updates. However, the benefits are significant, including improved accuracy, robustness against sensor failures, and enhanced coordination among agents. The distributed nature of the system allows for scalability and fault tolerance, making it suitable for complex and dynamic environments.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[24,89,99,101,146,100,111,75,182,97,79,149,95,16,17,74,105,114,76,108,162,9,102,5,93,106,178,77,104,151,145,160,177,83,96,179,194,201,20,128,192,203,205,110,193,195,18,23,82,180,183,21,72,124,204,88,196,15,19,98,152,14,28,113,132,115,150,166,86,197,122,121,131,148,206,223,10,22,107,116,123,212,94,184,202,221,81,191,207,215,130,199,85,214,210,158,11,84,134,157,181,198,109,117,164,6,147,90,161,185,190,25,87,13,126,133,220,125,53,42,208,209,218,29,59,73,217,222,50,159,155,127,129,156,211,8,142,143,189,216,48,119,213,63,120,153,174,154,118,35,200,169,188,46,78,27,69,43,45,55,144,70,103,80,4,31,49,26,165,57,186,224,32,71,1,64,163,44,54,60,141,219,92,68,112,30,40,187,36,39,139,167,140,33,37,47,137,67,62,91,136,225,34,41,58,51,56,138,172,168,38,52,65,170,66,171,135,175,3,176,61,173,12,7,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Euclidean distance is the straightforward measure of the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the coordinates of the two points. This method is simple and intuitive but does not account for the scale or correlation of the variables involved.\n\nIn contrast, Mahalanobis distance is a more sophisticated measure that takes into account the covariance structure of the data. It is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the point and the mean, weighted by the inverse of the covariance matrix. This means that Mahalanobis distance considers the correlation between variables and the scale of the data, making it more suitable for multivariate data where variables are not independent.\n\nMahalanobis distance is particularly advantageous in situations where the data is not normally distributed or where the variables are correlated. It provides a more accurate measure of the distance by accounting for the underlying structure of the data, which can lead to more reliable and meaningful results in estimation error evaluation. For instance, in scenarios involving complex sensor data or when the error distribution is skewed, Mahalanobis distance can offer a more precise assessment of the estimation error compared to Euclidean distance.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[38,4,39,37,20,34,42,119,186,54,66,58,40,41,67,64,209,108,138,169,191,32,132,176,222,154,141,36,49,68,211,219,216,18,47,56,60,129,220,17,208,50,53,223,122,142,198,57,62,193,224,22,192,82,111,35,45,48,55,155,130,200,26,52,63,106,115,163,19,61,104,214,215,31,43,51,78,124,133,206,10,75,105,121,197,44,87,147,173,175,217,5,9,14,99,46,116,164,93,178,196,221,23,29,71,123,162,166,190,194,225,98,128,131,69,114,65,134,143,158,177,195,210,15,24,27,81,107,136,205,145,161,140,165,168,33,74,79,109,120,127,137,156,167,76,96,157,203,21,89,97,117,170,8,80,103,148,150,179,149,181,16,110,139,187,212,70,83,144,218,86,118,184,185,199,207,73,102,146,174,180,202,77,113,213,59,94,100,171,201,11,135,6,91,25,95,182,72,84,126,152,183,88,112,159,172,101,13,90,30,160,3,151,153,204,1,92,28,85,125,189,2,12,188,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This is because Demographic Parity requires the classifier to steadily classify more of the negative region as positive, leading to a steady decrease in Group B accuracy. In contrast, the accuracy of Group B under the Equal Opportunity and Equalized Odds constraints remains relatively stable. Equal Opportunity aims to achieve the same true positive rate for Group B as for Group A, while Equalized Odds seeks to achieve the same false positive rate for Group B as for Group A. These constraints allow the classifier to maintain a higher accuracy for Group B as the probability of positives from Group B in the training data increases.\n\nThe implications of these observations highlight the importance of aligning fairness interventions with the specific fairness concerns in the data. Demographic Parity, while ensuring equal representation, can lead to significant accuracy losses for Group B, especially when the data is biased.

In contrast, the l-ortho and ortho methods show a slower decrease in error, with the ortho method maintaining a slightly higher error rate compared to the other methods.\n\nThe observed trends in reconstruction error can be explained by the nature of the stitching process and the role of anchors. As the number of anchors increases, the stitching process becomes more refined, allowing for better alignment and reconstruction of the latent spaces. The affine and linear methods, which are simpler transformations, benefit more from additional anchors, leading to faster convergence and lower error. The l-ortho and ortho methods, which are more complex and involve optimization, require more anchors to converge to a stable solution, explaining their slower decrease in error.

{"question":"How does varying the prompt size (g) from 1 to 3 impact the understandability and relevance of prompts generated through Directed Diversity, and what trade-offs do these effects suggest for message ideation?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[41],"raw_output":"","pred":"Varying the prompt size (g) from 1 to 3 in Directed Diversity impacts the understandability and relevance of generated prompts. With a prompt size of g = 1, the prompts are more concise and easier to understand, as evidenced by the higher prompt understandability scores (0.75) compared to g = 3 (0.50). This suggests that smaller prompts are more effective in conveying their intended message, thereby enhancing the ideator's ability to grasp the prompt's meaning and apply it to ideation tasks.\n\nHowever, the relevance of prompts decreases as the prompt size increases. For g = 1, the prompt relevance score is 0.80, which drops to 0.60 for g = 3. This indicates that while smaller prompts are more understandable, they may not be as closely aligned with the ideator's needs or the specific context of the ideation task, leading to less relevant prompts.\n\nThe trade-off here is that while larger prompts (g = 3) provide more context and potentially richer information, they also introduce complexity and confusion, as noted by the ideators who found it harder to combine phrases that deal with different aspects of exercise. This complexity can hinder the ideator's ability to effectively use the prompts, thereby reducing their adoption rate.\n\nIn summary, smaller prompts (g = 1) offer better understandability and higher relevance, making them more suitable for ideation tasks. Larger prompts (g = 3) provide more context but at the cost of reduced understandability and relevance, suggesting that a balance between prompt size and complexity is crucial for effective Directed Diversity in message ideation.","source":"data/test/2404.13633.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[43,41,40,51,52,142,48,44,126,27,53,26,91,39,123,7,2,49,34,37,5,90,10,13,16,42,50,38,140,143,9,28,94,33,35,18,101,22,12,11,46,141,45,124,92,31,134,6,32,117,127,133,102,95,139,36,128,99,30,93,104,108,113,138,23,119,132,121,71,135,62,81,55,122,58,114,15,29,107,47,61,160,70,21,73,131,96,24,57,68,56,75,89,110,111,115,116,3,60,66,88,105,14,25,64,120,136,54,97,137,86,150,59,69,112,144,147,20,74,78,80,85,65,67,76,82,98,106,164,79,83,125,152,161,63,77,109,118,145,129,156,87,103,146,72,162,100,149,159,151,157,8,153,19,84,155,17,130,154,1,158,148,163,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This suggests a significant mismatch between the supply of transactions and the capacity to mine blocks.\n\nThe steep curve for transactions indicates that a large number of transactions are being issued at any given time, but the horizontal line for blocks suggests that miners are able to process and confirm transactions at a relatively steady rate. This mismatch creates a \"contention\" for block space, as there are more transactions than blocks being mined.\n\nThe concept of \"contention transparency\" refers to the assumption that all transactions are publicly visible and available to all miners. However, the figure shows that only a small fraction of transactions are actually included in blocks. This lack of transparency means that miners may have different views on which transactions are available to them, leading to potential deviations from the norm.\n\nThe mismatch between transaction issuance and block mining creates a situation where miners may prioritize transactions based on factors like fees or other non-transparent criteria. This can lead to inefficiencies and potential unfairness in the system, as transactions with higher fees may be prioritized over others, even if they are not the most urgent or important.\n\nOverall, the figure illustrates the tension between the high rate of transaction issuance and the relatively constant block mining rate, highlighting the importance of addressing issues like contention transparency in blockchain systems.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,109,34,29,107,13,14,48,69,82,49,73,127,113,126,25,125,64,76,145,71,85,6,114,70,75,108,116,26,63,83,124,32,47,12,16,27,46,72,11,68,19,87,15,21,66,28,38,78,84,123,24,51,118,42,50,60,112,120,33,77,36,122,22,79,20,52,111,17,53,90,99,147,43,74,45,58,104,106,110,121,115,119,4,57,44,86,30,55,62,91,5,54,65,130,39,88,41,67,81,139,93,35,96,98,143,56,59,80,136,146,94,142,149,95,144,105,135,89,141,97,129,103,131,40,61,101,148,92,102,18,150,31,140,7,138,100,137,151,133,128,134,23,132,1,9,117,2,3,8,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

As the Mempool congestion increases, users tend to increase their transaction fee rates to incentivize miners to prioritize their transactions for inclusion in the next block. This strategy is effective in reducing commit delays, as higher fee rates are rewarded with faster transaction inclusion.\n\nIn data set A, the CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) of commit delays shows that transactions with higher fee rates (between 10^-4 and 10^-3 BTC/kB) experience significantly shorter delays compared to those with lower fee rates (less than 10^-4 BTC/kB). This indicates that users are willing to spend more to decrease commit delays during periods of high congestion.\n\nSimilarly, in data set B, the distribution of fee rates for transactions issued at different congestion levels (4MB < Mempool, 2MB < Mempool ≤ 4MB, 1MB < Mempool ≤ 2MB, and Non-congested) shows that users increase their fee rates during high congestion periods to ensure faster transaction inclusion. The CDF of commit delays for these transactions also confirms that higher fee rates correlate with shorter commit delays.\n\nIn summary, users employ higher transaction fee rates as a strategy to mitigate delays during high Mempool congestion, and this approach is effective in reducing commit delays.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[120,49,50,47,48,19,119,16,29,118,121,13,38,46,51,36,37,83,114,62,76,112,122,84,73,63,64,45,108,28,15,25,26,27,109,35,14,53,125,22,106,116,42,54,33,43,52,68,102,32,82,87,58,21,85,148,74,90,103,59,65,149,6,57,110,113,20,44,55,56,145,18,96,99,143,69,88,17,104,107,5,34,71,92,111,126,12,77,134,60,75,127,89,31,98,79,97,101,132,146,30,39,78,139,41,93,72,115,130,70,147,66,4,11,40,124,67,81,86,95,80,133,24,144,151,61,94,131,91,129,137,138,100,136,141,128,150,142,105,135,140,2,9,123,10,23,7,8,1,117,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is because the arbitrary data stored within these transactions can obscure the actual value transferred. The protocol specification from Omni Layer (2020) provides a framework for interpreting this data, but the inherent opacity of the information stored within the OP_Return opcodes complicates the process. \n\nThis opacity can exacerbate issues related to transaction fee opacity and fairness. When miners include transactions with OP_Return opcodes, they may prioritize these transactions based on factors other than the public fee rate, such as the value of the data stored within the opcodes. This can lead to a situation where transactions with higher fees but lower public fee rates are included in blocks, potentially at the expense of transactions with lower fees but higher public fee rates. This misalignment between the public fee rate and the actual value transferred can undermine the fairness of the transaction fee system and the transparency of the blockchain.\n\nMoreover, the use of OP_Return opcodes in transactions associated with the Omni Layer Protocol, which often involve stablecoins like Tether, can further complicate the assessment of transaction values. The high volume of these transactions, averaging 111 per block, can skew the distribution of transaction positions and fees, making it difficult to discern the true value of transactions and ensuring fair fee distribution.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[66,65,41,146,68,17,67,149,76,25,114,27,26,113,28,69,116,52,64,82,108,30,47,109,36,29,90,112,135,37,78,79,150,31,107,143,147,32,46,49,54,140,57,122,14,19,60,83,139,16,39,87,34,42,63,80,22,43,51,126,130,136,148,15,45,74,96,137,50,59,142,4,55,56,84,91,118,72,81,85,92,106,115,123,125,35,48,53,71,111,21,99,145,5,6,97,120,38,62,70,88,94,131,144,61,75,119,121,127,138,103,124,12,89,24,44,73,141,13,105,20,40,77,98,33,58,93,104,1,11,95,100,110,18,151,102,7,101,132,86,9,128,129,23,2,10,133,134,8,3,117],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What is the relationship between future independence in local rational semigroup transductions and the locality equation, and how does this relationship facilitate the transformation between local semigroup transductions and local rational semigroup transductions?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[156],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between future independence in local rational semigroup transductions and the locality equation is crucial for transforming local semigroup transductions into local rational semigroup transductions. Future independence ensures that the output of a transduction does not depend on future input letters, which is a key property for maintaining the locality of the transduction. The locality equation, which restricts the behavior of the transduction based on the prefix and suffix of the input word, is directly influenced by future independence. This is because future independence implies that the output is determined by the current and past input letters, ensuring that the transduction's behavior is consistent with the locality equation.\n\nIn the transformation process, the output function λ′ is defined to be future independent, ensuring that the transduction remains future-independent. This future independence, combined with the locality of λ, guarantees that λ′ also satisfies the locality equation. This is because if y1·h(a)·y2 = e, then y1·h(a) is a prefix of e, and thus, the future independence of λ′ ensures that the output does not depend on future letters, aligning with the locality equation.\n\nThis relationship facilitates the transformation by ensuring that the transduction's behavior is consistent with both future independence and the locality equation, thereby preserving the essential properties of the transduction during the transformation.","source":"data/test/2406.18934.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[156,155,132,167,106,215,150,149,146,153,157,105,103,172,3,154,169,152,183,173,210,102,109,104,151,107,23,100,11,214,135,168,189,101,182,80,147,188,82,211,218,99,141,185,21,176,133,216,20,13,65,123,166,174,24,32,171,196,212,25,35,46,111,116,14,92,4,19,219,88,186,2,12,28,217,89,91,93,114,125,140,170,36,142,175,179,31,203,213,9,160,124,128,138,187,66,139,194,201,26,39,184,41,45,112,159,206,34,69,97,113,22,59,117,120,220,18,122,148,207,33,83,87,90,127,181,47,67,27,37,49,161,180,48,158,38,61,63,71,98,115,129,40,86,134,143,204,30,94,119,126,200,205,64,68,85,110,121,178,197,208,42,50,62,136,60,77,198,209,51,162,56,57,70,131,164,202,6,54,74,79,96,16,78,81,177,190,75,84,137,144,193,76,130,199,44,165,10,163,1,95,145,43,195,52,58,73,8,15,191,55,29,72,192,7,108,118,5,53,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Provide an example to illustrate your answer.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[25],"raw_output":"","pred":"The concept of orbit-finiteness is a generalization of classical finiteness for sets with atoms. While classical finiteness requires that a set has a finite number of elements, orbit-finiteness allows for infinite sets as long as they have only finitely many orbits under the action of atom permutations.\n\nThis relationship can be illustrated with the example of the set of all atoms A. A is orbit-finite because it has only one orbit, which is the set of all atoms itself. However, A is not classically finite because it is infinite.\n\nAnother example is the set of tuples of atoms Ak. For any k, Ak is orbit-finite because it has only finitely many orbits, corresponding to different equality patterns among the atoms. However, Ak is not classically finite for any k > 1.\n\nThe key implication is that orbit-finiteness allows for infinite sets to be considered \"finite\" in a certain sense, as long as they have a limited number of distinct patterns or structures.

Filter 4, on the other hand, reverses the order of subject and object, which is not what is needed.\n\nTherefore, Filter 3 is the most suitable choice for the given criteria, as it explicitly enforces the desired positional relationships between the subject, predicate, and object while maintaining the matching number requirement.","source":"data/test/2406.18276.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[76,62,99,60,57,56,54,55,59,139,77,25,66,78,142,63,61,140,18,141,73,71,64,70,72,100,116,167,121,80,87,165,88,89,79,127,126,81,180,93,115,123,92,105,120,113,117,68,124,37,179,35,125,185,67,137,138,58,119,144,159,170,182,201,39,29,97,118,145,171,178,36,108,143,160,166,169,20,109,114,136,151,157,175,74,91,104,38,69,90,106,156,181,186,28,135,149,168,204,27,65,112,162,164,122,161,34,44,52,102,153,110,111,133,134,148,158,183,98,103,147,172,107,9,42,75,129,84,163,40,43,45,95,152,193,85,94,96,130,154,195,200,21,41,49,101,131,13,33,83,173,2,4,6,8,16,24,30,50,128,146,150,190,196,174,32,202,53,197,22,155,188,187,199,203,17,47,26,31,19,86,12,176,132,192,7,51,184,11,198,46,48,23,82,5,10,194,177,189,1,14,191,15,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This information is then organized into a hierarchical structure, with each line having its own analysis table storing linguistic information.\n\nTo manage this data, the system uses a relational database compatible with SQLAlchemy, such as SQLite.

Entity and relationship annotations include lemmas, entity types, line numbers, and user IDs.\n\nFor querying, the system uses Neo4j as the graph database server. Neo4j is connected via the Bolt protocol, allowing the graph database to exist independently on a separate system. Cypher, the query language for Neo4j, is used to query the graph database and produce results.

The points are connected by arrows, indicating a directed graph structure. This arrangement is significant in the context of d-majorization because it visually represents the partial order of distributions under this concept.\n\nIn d-majorization, the relationship between distributions is defined by a map \\( \\Lambda_d \\) that transforms distributions into a larger space, preserving their relative distances. The triangular arrangement and the directed arrows suggest a hierarchical structure where distributions are ordered based on their proximity to a reference distribution \\( d \\). Specifically, the points \\( p_3 = \\epsilon \\) and \\( p_3 = \\epsilon - \\gamma \\) likely represent distributions that are closer to \\( d \\) in the transformed space, while \\( p_1 = z \\), \\( p_1 = y \\), and \\( p_1 = x \\) represent distributions that are further away.\n\nThis arrangement helps illustrate that d-majorization captures the notion of relative uncertainty, where distributions are ordered based on their distance from a reference distribution. The directed graph structure shows that some distributions are closer to \\( d \\) than others, reflecting the hierarchical nature of d-disorder. This visual representation is crucial for understanding the concept of d-majorization and its implications in the study of relative uncertainty.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[80,284,283,285,257,279,277,278,276,79,286,244,282,54,189,280,242,248,288,287,211,266,64,281,336,61,81,292,13,59,95,116,256,222,289,78,339,77,252,320,49,263,48,71,76,117,118,268,245,2,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,18,22,32,45,46,60,84,110,128,142,144,233,240,55,82,138,186,208,178,231,265,267,291,63,146,205,249,68,132,62,73,114,272,299,56,58,154,158,273,52,53,74,103,212,258,214,333,161,183,29,67,75,121,199,216,269,21,34,125,348,353,72,85,93,119,218,355,362,66,213,89,113,134,148,290,309,43,123,177,217,243,255,19,127,135,137,206,226,262,369,26,129,179,190,201,228,229,334,6,27,30,105,295,335,337,344,57,195,200,41,102,225,342,343,347,363,31,96,207,215,327,24,50,108,175,181,191,39,94,126,236,261,130,139,197,210,301,302,326,361,38,51,112,140,149,159,264,151,324,331,37,104,162,163,193,198,224,322,40,107,184,204,230,232,234,235,247,294,303,92,120,136,152,188,315,316,332,341,28,69,221,296,298,346,5,97,124,131,237,250,253,328,35,223,260,349,367,9,164,270,319,321,330,352,360,368,14,20,165,172,318,345,356,358,25,36,99,338,340,42,47,122,170,173,185,238,297,311,351,169,251,300,305,325,350,1,70,91,171,271,354,90,100,275,98,155,192,307,310,147,153,160,219,259,304,359,88,133,166,209,246,317,293,323,101,141,176,182,227,308,312,115,220,241,314,10,106,33,86,167,187,254,23,87,150,180,313,194,196,329,65,370,44,83,357,111,157,168,174,145,274,202,366,156,203,17,364,239,306,365,3,109,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}]}

Iterative refinement allows the model to iteratively adjust its pose estimates based on feedback from the depth map, potentially leading to more accurate pose predictions.\n\n2.

{"question":"How does the behavior of the \"Current Shares\" curve differ from that of the \"Total Shares\" curve in the graph, and what might this difference indicate about the dynamics of content propagation on social networks?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[142],"raw_output":"","pred":"The graph shows two curves representing \"Current Shares\" and \"Total Shares\" over time. The \"Current Shares\" curve (dotted line) starts higher than the \"Total Shares\" curve (solid line) and then decreases more rapidly, eventually reaching zero. In contrast, the \"Total Shares\" curve continues to increase steadily, albeit at a slower rate than the \"Current Shares\" curve.\n\nThis difference indicates that while the total number of shares grows continuously, the number of active, current shares decreases over time. This suggests that as more users view and share the content, the pool of active sharers shrinks. The initial high number of current shares reflects the initial burst of activity when the content is first shared. However, as the content propagates further, the number of active sharers diminishes, leading to a decrease in the number of current shares.\n\nThis behavior can be explained by the dynamics of content propagation on social networks.

This approach can enhance the robustness of the model by identifying and potentially mitigating the impact of OOD data points.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[128,13,145,129,119,120,161,118,122,91,194,55,110,111,78,186,183,80,138,83,168,131,170,84,136,172,81,113,189,171,177,41,191,182,10,68,132,190,154,178,185,9,43,70,127,69,139,7,16,112,181,5,121,133,79,85,166,49,72,142,149,160,174,73,62,77,82,105,54,143,103,11,123,90,115,14,38,59,74,76,134,21,42,155,179,130,109,137,6,108,33,44,86,107,51,32,46,58,114,18,57,97,167,37,63,4,56,61,65,71,93,47,141,146,173,188,60,184,22,40,89,101,117,144,148,12,39,88,157,95,102,126,140,20,29,176,192,96,106,124,153,193,26,92,135,158,31,52,125,180,15,24,75,87,98,165,8,67,175,27,28,94,195,50,169,30,156,36,99,104,187,45,23,25,48,66,17,164,64,151,152,53,100,35,150,116,34,147,1,2,162,163,159,19,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

However, it also reveals limitations in handling complex, dynamic actions and the subtleties of real-world interactions, as evidenced by the inconsistencies in outpainting and class-conditional generation tasks.","source":"data/test/2405.16728.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[121,122,112,119,14,64,117,16,114,102,138,103,115,118,10,140,143,151,163,48,109,158,116,111,144,75,91,137,92,105,139,141,142,76,157,22,107,108,2,63,93,120,77,128,84,136,167,171,23,87,149,106,15,101,161,162,20,104,26,61,78,86,100,155,165,62,97,5,21,135,125,129,147,13,74,94,34,54,47,58,65,81,85,90,96,195,56,164,172,153,9,28,72,79,95,110,148,199,46,66,80,89,113,127,150,160,30,31,27,82,152,154,38,60,73,186,123,156,178,41,83,99,184,188,49,53,196,4,12,40,98,134,185,193,68,176,19,173,197,198,35,55,69,71,130,177,182,6,51,52,194,200,1,88,133,11,33,45,59,189,18,126,57,132,145,183,24,67,131,70,187,36,168,190,146,159,179,192,8,42,7,29,32,174,3,170,37,50,124,39,191,25,175,43,166,180,181,17,169,44],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This indicates that the GPU implementation is significantly faster, reducing the per-iteration computation time by a factor of approximately 45 times for a batch size of 200 and 36 times for a batch size of 600.\n\nThe implications for choosing one over the other are significant. The GPU implementation offers superior scalability and efficiency, especially for larger batch sizes. The GPU's ability to handle parallel computations makes it ideal for batch optimization tasks, reducing the overall computation time and improving performance. However, the multi-threaded CPU implementation, while less efficient per iteration, benefits from the ability to execute any off-the-shelf optimizer in parallel without requiring changes to the underlying matrix algebra. This can be advantageous in scenarios where the GPU is not available or when the problem size is small enough to fit within the CPU's capabilities.\n\nIn terms of resource competition, the multi-threaded CPU implementation may face challenges with resource contention, especially as the number of threads increases, potentially slowing down the overall computation time. The GPU, on the other hand, is designed to handle parallel computations efficiently, minimizing such issues. Therefore, for applications requiring high scalability and performance, the GPU implementation is recommended, whereas the multi-threaded CPU implementation might be more suitable for smaller problem sizes or when GPU resources are not available.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[67,75,66,12,94,90,93,48,10,55,56,65,82,19,81,91,46,86,11,6,92,95,52,77,83,50,18,64,98,44,38,49,32,34,54,70,104,53,76,30,57,14,85,20,43,63,35,36,87,96,47,29,69,100,37,60,61,78,101,8,42,26,79,107,33,88,106,15,45,102,103,72,105,25,89,31,17,7,71,80,59,2,27,68,24,28,16,84,41,62,99,73,13,39,58,74,109,23,112,40,4,111,97,110,22,51,108,21,3,1,9,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

It includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data. This step is essential for improving the quality and reliability of the data, making it easier to detect anomalies.\n\n2. **Dataset Patterns Generation**: In this phase, the preprocessed data is transformed into various patterns.

This high entropy suggests that the network is modeling a wide range of features, including both relevant and irrelevant ones, leading to a less focused and potentially less efficient representation.\n- **With REM:** The parse trees generated with REM have low entropy, meaning the connections between capsules are more sparse and focused. This reduction in entropy indicates that REM helps in pruning unnecessary connections, leading to a more streamlined and efficient representation of the input data.\n\n**Discriminative Features:**\n- **Without REM:** The parse trees without REM may include many irrelevant features, which can dilute the focus on the most discriminative parts of the input.

The yaw and pitch plots are nearly identical, while the roll plot shows some minor discrepancies but maintains a similar overall shape.\n\nOverall, the MSCEqF trajectory estimate appears to be very accurate and closely follows the ground truth MoCap trajectory, both in terms of overall shape and position. The small differences likely result from the computational constraints and approximations used in the MSCEqF algorithm, but the overall performance is impressive given the resource limitations of the real-time system.","source":"data/test/2407.14297v1.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[153,148,14,150,151,158,145,9,15,146,133,143,160,11,152,154,16,24,149,172,22,157,147,74,111,126,142,6,110,131,114,72,77,113,125,13,76,116,94,107,127,132,78,141,161,75,112,128,8,60,96,130,139,105,166,71,73,118,156,82,83,98,62,102,117,23,50,103,108,59,91,180,173,51,85,129,134,19,20,55,67,86,106,5,93,121,175,92,162,170,68,87,97,101,58,63,79,89,124,36,52,70,104,177,54,64,10,115,120,135,144,45,84,123,138,174,21,29,61,39,155,176,38,57,69,122,168,171,136,163,17,47,119,159,1,7,18,53,65,109,178,179,28,34,43,80,3,44,66,137,164,26,90,167,12,41,99,140,31,33,35,56,165,27,46,100,25,169,2,81,95,40,48,4,37,88,49,32,30,42],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The unit plane projection simplifies the representation of the orientation, making it computationally efficient and reducing the complexity of the filter.\n\nSecondly, the use of 9 clones allows for a balance between computational efficiency and robustness. More clones can improve the filter's ability to handle outliers and maintain consistency, but too many can increase computational load. The choice of 9 clones strikes a reasonable compromise, providing sufficient redundancy to handle errors while keeping the computational overhead manageable.\n\nOverall, these parameter choices enhance the real-time capabilities of the MSCEqF, ensuring that it can provide constant and reliable estimates at the camera rate.

In this schema, entity types are organized in a tree-like hierarchy, with more specific entity types branching off from more general ones. This hierarchical organization allows for the inheritance of properties from parent entity types to child entity types.\n\nFor example, the \"Athlete\" entity type inherits properties from its parent \"Person\" entity type, such as \"name\" and \"citizenship\". This inheritance means that any property associated with \"Person\" will also be associated with \"Athlete\" unless explicitly overridden. This hierarchical inheritance of properties simplifies the process of entity classification and identification.\n\nWhen classifying an entity, the system can start at the root entity type \"thing\" and traverse down the hierarchy, checking for properties associated with each entity type along the way. This approach reduces the need to check every property for every entity, making the classification process more efficient.\n\nHowever, it also introduces potential challenges. If a property is associated with a more specific entity type but not with its parent, it may not be inherited correctly. This can lead to misclassifications if the system relies solely on inheritance. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to how properties are associated and inherited across the hierarchy to ensure accurate entity classification and identification.","source":"data/test/2405.02463.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[50,42,11,48,47,49,55,67,34,35,59,114,41,12,43,44,61,91,69,118,3,38,9,119,145,6,31,92,123,96,17,18,19,90,46,57,58,66,20,56,121,64,120,126,36,45,95,74,94,97,100,113,131,7,28,39,136,98,102,1,25,70,27,127,54,65,26,80,93,122,24,77,30,37,142,23,60,63,68,78,75,149,84,99,101,82,83,125,5,76,79,81,87,134,51,110,124,144,16,21,148,116,112,33,137,146,85,10,73,117,140,14,71,86,29,111,103,88,32,133,143,104,128,115,138,13,89,147,141,107,15,53,106,132,139,130,135,109,129,72,105,40,108,52,62,150,4,8,22,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Dynamic adaptation: As new data sources and evolving domain knowledge emerge, continuous learning enables the graph to adapt and incorporate new information in a controlled manner.\n\n3. Quality preservation: By making small, frequent adjustments, continuous learning can help maintain the overall quality and integrity of the graph over time, rather than risking degradation through infrequent major updates.\n\n4.

As the filtration parameter ϵ is swept from 0 to the maximum pairwise distance within the point cloud, it creates a sequence of nested simplicial complexes. Each complex represents the topological structure of the data at a specific ϵ value.\n\nThis filtration process generates barcodes and persistent diagrams, which are visual representations of the topological features. Barcodes are a finite collection of intervals, each representing a topological feature (e.g., a loop, a void) that appears and disappears as ϵ increases. The length of each interval corresponds to the persistence of the feature, indicating how long it exists in the data.\n\nPersistent diagrams, on the other hand, are 2D visualizations that plot the birth and death times of topological features. The x-axis represents the birth time (when the feature first appears), and the y-axis represents the death time (when the feature disappears). Each point in the diagram corresponds to a topological feature, and the distance between points indicates the persistence of the feature.\n\nThese representations convey important information about the topological features of the data, such as the number and persistence of loops, voids, and higher-dimensional holes. By analyzing these features, researchers can gain insights into the underlying structure and dynamics of the data, which is particularly useful in fields like biology, neuroscience, and materials science.","source":"data/test/2408.11948.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[129,131,124,136,130,141,17,122,18,15,145,16,144,142,133,135,126,48,56,85,4,127,132,134,166,109,143,158,148,7,168,165,128,119,157,139,121,53,125,123,64,31,140,110,37,149,13,43,49,74,120,73,75,112,117,138,154,167,76,78,159,3,11,24,46,108,163,25,80,147,84,111,115,155,6,47,63,66,161,28,33,68,102,10,77,104,150,153,156,9,29,32,45,58,93,100,114,35,36,65,72,79,118,151,164,14,30,82,137,152,160,42,92,50,54,86,27,38,61,83,98,5,44,52,21,51,57,70,103,105,116,39,55,94,113,146,162,26,97,34,60,69,106,71,99,90,19,59,1,91,87,67,12,20,81,40,88,96,89,22,62,41,23,101,95,8,107,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This methodological advancement enables more reliable and scalable research on student engagement and participation in classroom settings, overcoming the limitations of previous studies that were often limited by small sample sizes and the inability to analyze individual student behavior.","source":"data/test/2407.05803.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[208,207,216,206,59,61,60,215,62,205,253,39,211,213,63,210,241,23,209,31,65,212,6,254,214,41,11,68,13,217,12,155,130,184,66,15,67,134,53,84,149,145,179,78,74,113,131,114,156,161,227,72,180,48,176,36,148,154,163,139,153,172,226,50,51,135,178,34,47,147,52,138,157,158,177,102,133,137,151,152,201,225,64,112,132,218,108,110,9,21,28,43,56,186,199,22,40,82,230,25,38,49,55,90,146,162,220,69,174,189,200,202,243,42,92,141,160,251,32,187,198,81,164,235,240,57,70,80,93,142,54,109,144,173,233,83,95,116,175,35,76,94,136,88,167,185,229,237,249,26,29,58,71,111,86,118,128,140,170,27,73,104,120,219,45,191,250,30,85,100,124,181,188,193,224,231,79,165,183,17,46,107,150,194,197,33,98,168,192,195,77,232,14,24,159,7,44,106,196,247,115,8,75,126,203,228,242,245,99,169,16,91,248,117,96,101,166,37,103,236,252,190,222,239,97,122,244,89,87,234,204,10,238,105,182,119,223,125,18,143,171,121,221,246,19,123,129,1,4,127,3,20,2,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

While the cultures provide a useful framework for generating and analyzing election instances, they may not accurately reflect the full spectrum of real-world election dynamics. This can lead to potential biases in the evaluation of voting rules, as the rules might perform differently in real-world scenarios than in the generated instances.\n\nTo address this, researchers need to carefully consider the limitations of the statistical cultures and incorporate additional factors that are more representative of real-world elections.

{"question":"How does the distribution of votes in the urn model change with varying α parameters, and what is the mathematical upper bound for the expected number of different votes in this model?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[37],"raw_output":"","pred":"The distribution of votes in the urn model changes significantly with varying α parameters. As α increases, the number of different votes decreases, leading to a more concentrated distribution of votes. This is because a higher α parameter means that each vote is more likely to be repeated in subsequent iterations, reducing the diversity of votes. Consequently, the map for elections with higher α parameters shows fewer distinct points, indicating a more uniform distribution of votes.\n\nMathematically, the upper bound for the expected number of different votes under the urn model can be calculated using the formula provided in Proposition 3.1. This formula is given by the sum of the series \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{1 + (i-1)\\alpha} \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of voters and \\( \\alpha \\) is the parameter of contagion. This formula accounts for the probability of sampling a new vote in each iteration, with the probability decreasing as more votes are repeated. The upper bound is derived by considering the worst-case scenario where each vote is sampled at least once before any new vote is added, thus ignoring the case where a vote is sampled multiple times before a new one is added. This ensures that the bound is not underestimated.","source":"data/test/2407.11889.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,96,28,97,95,36,142,55,166,156,102,120,57,169,184,100,160,146,38,144,50,66,105,170,30,98,74,167,22,117,168,33,35,123,162,53,93,103,143,165,157,11,12,104,141,151,14,34,51,71,86,140,145,164,172,27,109,148,155,59,72,29,54,132,152,189,31,21,90,92,115,133,85,114,119,9,79,161,112,187,20,61,122,126,130,65,70,116,135,43,52,88,107,13,15,45,60,75,82,154,84,128,131,134,147,186,48,56,76,91,94,118,127,179,111,137,158,192,44,150,10,42,46,67,81,159,5,171,47,39,68,125,149,16,40,49,64,78,177,183,163,32,58,121,124,153,62,69,113,3,99,19,41,191,194,2,4,17,63,190,6,7,24,25,101,110,129,182,106,138,195,139,193,197,23,136,175,89,77,87,178,26,188,18,174,176,180,1,73,185,83,173,196,80,108,181,8],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The ESCO taxonomy, curated by humans, covers over 13,000 skills and 3,000 occupations in 27 languages.\n\nBy incorporating ESCO data through two pre-training objectives - Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and a novel ESCO relation prediction task - ESCOXLM-R aims to improve multilingual performance on JAD-related tasks.

The green dots represent the aggregated points of events, which are spread across the map, indicating the distribution of occurrences across all time steps within the environment. The red dots denote the current locations of sensors, which have been strategically placed based on the centroid placements derived from k-means clustering. \n\nThe clustering pattern shows that the red dots (sensor positions) are concentrated in areas where the green dots (event aggregations) are densely packed, suggesting that the sensors are placed in regions of high event frequency. This distribution implies that the k-means clustering algorithm has successfully identified areas of significant environmental activity, which are critical for effective monitoring and data analysis.\n\nThe implications of this clustering pattern are significant for overall data analysis. By placing sensors in areas with high event density, the monitoring system can capture and analyze data more efficiently, focusing on regions where environmental phenomena are most prevalent. This targeted approach enhances the accuracy and relevance of the data collected, leading to more informed decision-making and better resource allocation for environmental monitoring and management.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[288,276,294,74,283,281,53,233,286,306,311,236,280,297,277,278,282,290,285,287,310,308,49,279,284,307,295,299,57,292,293,298,62,137,273,289,291,270,272,69,296,305,309,300,303,301,274,271,304,237,254,275,231,302,251,52,61,390,239,210,24,46,125,161,318,132,255,322,250,324,51,140,383,315,420,154,234,326,165,321,152,314,323,327,320,50,328,146,247,313,317,134,170,384,260,325,329,316,73,230,319,330,48,468,151,242,252,54,238,124,149,332,47,177,211,365,198,264,182,3,224,265,268,166,388,389,181,229,244,333,68,212,344,25,31,256,267,22,56,204,257,263,405,10,148,385,406,266,358,79,387,21,147,150,160,213,228,249,145,157,232,243,334,121,176,221,235,240,374,23,116,139,141,162,469,38,144,184,203,356,380,13,183,205,206,259,120,122,185,127,167,262,312,342,399,445,142,407,432,153,168,241,11,158,386,395,483,36,55,245,220,466,467,85,128,208,214,340,367,401,404,412,12,129,180,331,369,376,379,372,381,396,78,80,192,193,377,382,429,98,108,195,248,360,458,463,465,29,58,115,392,6,105,435,476,7,126,130,156,348,361,35,169,215,258,351,370,410,419,456,461,472,113,118,179,222,347,371,373,394,397,59,219,223,436,437,164,194,207,338,357,391,462,143,197,362,364,368,421,460,480,2,39,209,400,434,464,477,484,26,112,123,201,217,253,363,422,454,27,102,106,136,171,202,378,459,485,9,34,60,96,114,200,403,408,428,451,475,482,16,19,67,375,439,473,486,95,100,131,159,172,186,187,216,246,345,398,478,40,43,81,33,37,45,110,173,227,366,393,433,82,91,107,138,196,409,413,423,15,65,70,88,92,352,415,416,32,77,93,155,425,426,440,448,470,8,66,75,94,101,335,350,418,481,42,44,71,86,163,226,337,411,441,453,471,191,346,355,402,417,449,479,76,117,133,178,354,427,430,431,457,30,174,189,199,63,97,104,341,4,111,188,261,353,18,450,487,83,109,218,424,446,452,343,349,1,414,72,87,89,14,64,135,336,339,17,41,84,119,175,269,359,438,442,455,99,103,190,225,443,444,28,90,5,474,447,20],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The penalty term in the objective function encourages minimizing the overlap area.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[71,70,68,75,175,58,76,73,54,61,57,482,484,31,126,145,249,369,24,53,480,485,64,144,248,67,14,338,95,150,66,189,282,481,220,60,63,65,206,221,483,370,59,136,253,313,332,153,217,244,50,171,173,263,368,45,132,51,134,417,47,235,333,35,49,131,298,404,62,32,219,252,257,39,72,286,38,266,316,337,371,469,213,236,247,214,336,383,56,130,163,223,304,391,335,386,393,187,212,218,279,318,325,388,405,430,479,25,55,87,285,329,267,334,259,381,387,415,52,113,164,245,385,394,3,15,85,122,165,174,210,297,301,344,395,414,465,33,140,172,29,156,176,256,260,365,422,77,186,193,292,306,309,340,157,166,216,283,354,358,478,9,13,34,207,239,476,27,135,152,168,211,232,317,118,238,287,439,446,8,78,124,240,303,366,419,420,23,46,48,83,97,117,342,349,108,141,243,258,274,299,432,470,16,26,116,148,190,242,281,294,296,421,464,69,188,198,199,261,346,376,423,43,110,268,347,359,363,450,21,202,222,295,378,416,434,10,11,114,162,167,246,280,305,455,22,74,91,127,159,284,300,302,328,389,392,409,411,460,36,40,84,112,120,129,143,197,201,250,311,322,451,461,472,12,92,226,231,262,277,382,390,403,2,82,181,183,362,427,5,154,255,323,435,4,41,44,94,184,237,312,314,384,396,412,436,473,6,28,115,119,137,185,200,315,348,375,431,449,133,204,271,330,379,380,397,438,457,17,178,179,278,326,477,42,80,98,293,37,289,356,401,429,486,101,103,147,151,161,205,272,310,345,351,377,399,440,475,30,93,100,169,192,208,241,324,357,367,442,448,468,20,81,275,307,408,413,428,445,142,264,273,341,350,447,459,111,149,195,291,372,441,471,121,155,234,251,327,355,374,418,7,88,99,102,182,361,364,400,444,79,109,146,203,227,402,424,426,458,467,86,125,170,254,288,308,343,360,452,474,1,105,138,319,373,453,463,276,96,106,123,265,331,437,462,18,180,230,107,158,194,339,353,407,410,433,90,104,196,224,321,139,160,191,290,398,209,228,269,456,425,443,128,320,177,215,233,89,270,406,466,19,352,229,454,225,487],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Immediate impact metrics include the interception rate, which measures the percentage of successfully intercepted invaders out of the total number of attempted breaches. A higher interception rate indicates a more effective defense strategy. Additionally, the time to neutralize threats, which assesses the average time taken by defenders to detect, engage, and neutralize invaders, provides insight into the responsiveness and efficiency of the defense system.\n\nLong-term adaptability can be evaluated through metrics such as the adaptability score, which reflects the defense system’s ability to adapt to new or evolving threats over time. This includes incorporating lessons learned from past invasions to improve future defense responses. Another key metric is resource efficiency, which analyzes how effectively the defenders utilize their available resources, including personnel, technology, and energy, to maximize interception rates and minimize response times.\n\nBy combining these metrics, a comprehensive assessment of the defense strategy’s effectiveness can be achieved, ensuring that both immediate performance and long-term adaptability are considered. This approach allows for targeted improvements and adjustments to enhance overall security against invader threats.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[445,447,446,454,39,67,334,465,105,312,139,187,442,81,248,433,437,439,457,102,108,51,93,112,188,415,155,96,260,269,11,45,113,416,83,98,436,450,470,36,37,117,118,256,332,393,207,262,392,474,97,166,178,335,395,432,438,451,245,430,449,17,94,103,333,425,19,60,176,422,458,9,65,251,401,440,448,33,35,72,100,101,193,255,417,429,435,452,466,247,424,76,138,200,41,156,198,441,444,467,66,110,143,394,40,59,88,109,129,242,338,354,397,420,431,104,259,325,434,468,38,95,127,337,426,443,12,58,99,144,270,294,372,376,411,43,61,400,404,27,71,130,252,350,407,456,469,16,44,106,148,179,214,246,257,396,419,428,478,5,15,78,84,87,168,180,240,402,459,29,107,111,282,347,453,460,18,119,73,115,151,234,366,455,353,413,79,211,261,77,91,120,140,141,250,374,472,473,34,56,137,142,414,206,212,236,306,418,85,90,167,201,213,26,186,243,249,356,403,421,464,42,195,461,471,68,89,135,244,336,14,116,232,368,381,149,210,219,235,339,427,24,55,348,373,377,133,192,233,238,343,379,408,258,387,169,190,263,375,410,412,1,23,114,157,209,346,384,483,228,382,399,383,423,463,123,154,199,227,385,52,300,359,50,147,159,160,288,362,406,485,4,57,92,132,48,409,22,370,380,80,122,124,145,208,340,405,202,398,75,128,152,276,319,344,388,134,136,241,345,316,342,371,32,46,70,484,8,63,131,476,10,54,82,21,189,229,239,314,328,358,386,462,479,223,225,341,365,6,7,121,194,283,326,329,158,171,191,215,327,331,486,313,378,30,153,161,196,284,315,317,352,369,126,162,172,216,217,330,349,86,165,253,295,13,267,361,25,220,291,318,363,367,49,174,237,264,297,308,231,296,475,47,221,268,278,285,286,351,390,31,203,289,309,355,477,20,265,266,277,301,302,321,389,164,185,290,310,357,360,481,53,173,204,287,311,364,391,64,163,224,271,272,273,299,320,480,183,218,222,298,170,181,184,205,150,226,303,28,182,292,307,487,279,482,3,293,125,197,322,323,254,304,177,280,324,274,281,305,69,275,175,2,62,230,146,74],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This capability allows the system to anticipate the next logical events in a story, making the narrative more engaging and less predictable.\n\nAction model acquisition involves extracting and modeling the actions and their effects from textual descriptions. By leveraging NLP to identify and categorize actions, the system can better understand the player's interactions and the resulting changes in the narrative environment. This understanding enables the system to provide more contextually relevant and meaningful responses, enhancing the player's immersion and the narrative's depth.\n\nTogether, these advancements can create more dynamic and responsive text-based games.

Continuous signals, such as financial time-series, spatiotemporal data, or MRI images, lack inherent segmentation, making it difficult to identify corresponding elements across modalities.\n\nTo address these challenges, continuous alignment employs two main techniques: continuous warping and modality segmentation. Continuous warping involves representing continuous signals as continuous representation spaces and aligning them through a bridging mechanism. This is often achieved through adversarial training, where one representation space is warped into another to minimize the ability of a domain classifier to distinguish between them. Techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are used to segment and align multi-view time-series data by maximizing their similarity through time warping.\n\nModality segmentation, on the other hand, involves dividing high-dimensional data into elements with semantically meaningful boundaries. This is particularly useful for temporal segmentation, where the goal is to discover temporal boundaries across sequential data. Clustering approaches are commonly used to group continuous data based on semantic similarity, facilitating the alignment of continuous signals by identifying and aligning semantically relevant segments.","source":"data/test/2404.18976.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,50,37,44,13,118,6,146,12,28,38,121,136,174,24,11,126,3,45,57,43,30,25,51,27,122,16,52,123,138,60,172,18,42,92,102,125,137,36,54,58,116,20,41,62,81,150,155,170,53,117,195,32,49,90,143,168,183,191,202,77,173,34,40,56,107,188,61,63,108,159,7,175,139,147,171,31,46,64,66,156,9,87,111,112,153,209,69,74,75,85,120,127,162,187,19,93,151,154,164,206,15,29,89,59,131,72,109,157,177,68,78,94,103,114,152,180,200,21,67,70,86,124,134,22,73,106,119,133,189,14,181,194,47,79,80,128,149,160,193,201,207,113,132,161,165,176,197,26,35,65,95,210,5,88,182,184,33,55,71,91,115,141,148,190,203,17,96,104,144,166,167,179,192,196,211,213,99,178,204,23,98,100,101,105,198,205,39,145,158,185,214,83,130,140,208,142,199,84,169,135,163,212,82,4,76,110,129,8,2,186,97,10,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

When S is large, the model relies heavily on the synergy between modalities to make accurate predictions.

This is because the model's ability to leverage the combined information from both modalities is compromised, resulting in a failure to capture the necessary interactions for accurate predictions.\n\nIn contrast, redundancy (R) values do not have a direct influence on performance drops when a modality is missing. The correlation between R and performance drops is minimal, with a correlation coefficient of ρ = 0.01. This indicates that redundancy, which measures the shared information between modalities, does not significantly impact the model's performance when a modality is absent. The model's performance is more sensitive to the loss of unique information (U) and the inability to learn the synergy between modalities, rather than the shared information.\n\nIn summary, large S values lead to significant performance drops when a modality is missing, whereas R values have a negligible impact on performance drops.","source":"data/test/2404.18976.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[74,107,16,14,66,73,75,62,21,108,28,65,70,76,113,20,72,106,112,26,64,29,109,8,114,110,155,136,115,42,172,111,165,34,60,137,79,131,157,71,153,18,43,81,45,118,167,126,17,80,22,35,41,48,88,127,128,63,159,164,78,95,102,132,151,160,30,61,90,130,193,40,98,199,12,19,32,158,168,180,200,97,142,150,169,9,15,86,125,170,197,7,59,85,93,184,195,210,13,44,52,104,3,53,58,87,139,140,27,46,207,209,162,191,89,152,156,203,212,23,105,122,135,143,163,171,25,83,84,94,96,99,166,57,146,176,187,82,190,68,133,138,149,214,31,69,120,37,154,173,188,202,100,121,134,144,186,194,198,206,24,129,141,161,185,47,124,148,175,205,39,51,181,182,204,208,49,145,178,36,38,50,123,174,101,117,196,11,55,189,192,119,183,213,92,6,56,67,177,54,103,5,147,201,211,91,33,116,179,77,2,4,1,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Furthermore, incorporating a more robust and versatile pick-and-place mechanism could improve the system's precision and reliability, ensuring consistent and accurate placement of components. These enhancements would significantly expand the LaserFactory's capabilities, making it a more versatile and efficient fabrication tool.","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[57,56,111,46,43,58,42,40,24,39,50,45,11,54,51,55,12,8,44,32,52,112,33,72,106,109,71,114,60,80,7,37,118,113,27,47,76,107,3,22,34,35,21,102,31,13,41,78,25,84,115,83,105,26,19,36,49,59,23,75,124,17,28,48,81,20,87,126,123,127,110,85,14,86,122,53,95,73,79,89,108,90,5,9,125,97,101,66,117,128,68,70,63,93,120,91,100,121,69,15,65,119,4,67,103,6,38,62,92,1,98,99,2,18,74,104,30,116,29,94,96,61,10,82,88,16,64,77],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How does the observed discrepancy between the predicted and measured repulsive forces in the magnetic interaction experiment relate to the concept of coercivity, and what adjustments were made to the model to account for this discrepancy?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[97],"raw_output":"","pred":"The observed discrepancy between the predicted and measured repulsive forces in the magnetic interaction experiment can be attributed to the concept of coercivity. Coercivity refers to the magnetic material's resistance to demagnetization. In the experiment, the measured repulsive forces were weaker than those predicted by correlating the matrix values. This discrepancy is likely due to the soft magnetic faces of the pixels, which have low coercivity. When two attractive magnetic dipoles are brought into contact, they reinforce their attractive alignments, leading to stronger attraction. Conversely, repulsive dipoles will realign to an attractive equilibrium if free to rotate, a condition that the low coercivity of the soft magnetic faces may support. This realignment results in weaker repulsive forces compared to the predicted values.\n\nTo account for this effect, the researchers implemented a scaling factor of 0.09 to the repulsive forces predicted by correlation. This scaling factor normalizes the magnitude of the repulsive pixels to those in attraction, thereby aligning the predicted and measured forces more closely. The normalized sum of squared differences between the measured and predicted results using this scaling factor was 0.014, indicating that the model is an accurate predictor of force between magnetically programmed faces. This adjustment helps in better understanding and predicting the magnetic interactions between the programmed magnetic sheets.","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[98,15,96,97,70,99,71,72,36,13,85,100,101,26,94,29,63,84,95,9,103,27,64,44,62,86,28,60,65,92,112,68,107,110,49,35,90,50,105,41,69,83,106,109,61,67,125,122,119,14,42,8,87,128,54,57,88,108,120,25,33,89,118,12,43,76,78,93,104,45,113,124,2,5,34,48,4,24,77,80,121,30,91,123,75,116,10,18,59,81,102,117,126,6,16,82,3,58,74,127,11,22,37,47,56,66,21,39,111,20,38,32,46,55,73,7,1,114,53,19,52,115,23,17,51,31,79,40],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

With a larger initialization scale (1e-2), the components converge more slowly and require more observations to achieve a low reconstruction error. Conversely, with smaller initialization scales (1e-3, 1e-4), the components converge faster, leading to lower reconstruction errors with fewer observations. This trend is more pronounced for the 8x8x8x8 (order 4) tensor completion task, where the differences in convergence rates and reconstruction errors are even more evident.\n\nThe faster convergence with smaller initialization scales is likely due to the initial components being closer to zero, which reduces the magnitude of the gradient and thus the rate of change in the components. This allows the optimization process to more efficiently find the low-rank solution. In contrast, larger initialization scales result in components that are further from zero, leading to larger gradients and slower convergence. The smaller initialization scales also tend to produce solutions with lower tensor rank, as indicated by the rank plots, which align with the theoretical analysis that suggests an implicit regularization towards low rank.\n\nOverall, the initialization scale plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and accuracy of the gradient descent process in tensor factorization, with smaller scales generally leading to faster convergence and lower reconstruction errors.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[32,93,21,30,22,120,48,92,145,147,29,130,31,37,45,94,20,23,121,47,143,91,13,24,12,25,146,38,76,14,27,28,35,44,16,39,85,111,183,26,119,17,79,110,11,34,40,74,86,138,46,18,54,118,69,108,5,33,36,185,78,82,144,43,125,182,8,128,105,148,150,135,41,52,89,7,68,122,179,57,95,129,62,77,80,164,161,168,190,50,63,137,153,9,55,151,3,4,19,58,109,141,81,188,84,166,169,42,99,142,149,53,75,100,139,181,197,96,127,152,156,178,184,49,191,187,51,88,158,87,112,165,204,206,140,176,106,157,70,72,126,163,67,123,107,177,180,201,101,103,114,171,192,15,104,134,167,189,116,174,59,113,115,196,64,65,162,193,194,198,172,205,83,71,97,102,175,124,160,195,170,186,66,61,90,136,159,60,98,199,131,173,200,133,132,155,202,154,1,203,117,2,56,73,10,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

In this context, the input to the network is a tuple of variables, each represented by a one-hot vector. The network processes this input through a hidden layer that includes a 1x1 convolution operation and global pooling.\n\nThe 1x1 convolution operation involves applying a set of learnable filters to the input, effectively performing a local operation on the input data. This operation is akin to a convolutional layer in a neural network, where the filters slide across the input to compute inner products, resulting in a set of activations. The 1x1 convolution is particularly useful because it maintains the spatial dimensions of the input, making it suitable for tensor factorization.\n\nFollowing the 1x1 convolution, the global pooling operation is applied. This operation aggregates the activations from each channel by computing products of all activations within each channel. This step introduces a polynomial non-linearity into the network, as the products of the activations are not linear functions of the input. The global pooling effectively reduces the dimensionality of the activations, capturing the overall characteristics of the input data.\n\nThe output of the network is a scalar value, which is the sum of the pooled activations across all channels. This scalar output represents the final prediction of the network. The entire process can be mathematically represented as a tensor factorization, where the network learns to decompose the input into a sum of tensor products of the learned filters and the input variables. This decomposition is analogous to the structure of a shallow non-linear convolutional network, where the network learns to extract meaningful features from the input data.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[23,40,27,41,39,25,35,24,143,142,57,141,4,5,36,89,33,144,74,43,118,125,13,54,37,93,8,32,145,22,120,150,26,50,92,31,86,42,82,81,87,55,146,3,30,128,167,44,147,178,29,45,47,175,177,180,20,179,38,46,79,151,21,48,80,206,78,188,11,12,187,49,84,204,77,130,164,170,7,62,76,64,14,176,61,83,191,91,190,60,189,28,58,94,121,85,152,63,138,156,192,110,127,166,169,184,16,88,153,17,18,65,171,186,199,182,202,34,95,122,196,9,72,71,52,172,53,119,173,149,159,203,10,109,111,205,108,126,174,181,19,69,90,197,59,158,183,75,195,131,67,134,163,160,185,200,56,148,162,165,51,66,106,132,70,68,112,161,201,101,193,194,198,97,107,133,140,15,99,100,105,114,104,123,168,103,129,154,98,157,116,124,2,6,96,135,155,115,1,113,73,137,102,136,139,117],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"How does the choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) influence the network's ability to model interactions between vertices, and what are the implications of using a product aggregation operator in this context?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[61],"raw_output":"","pred":"The choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) significantly influences the network's ability to model interactions between vertices. AGGREGATE combines the hidden embeddings of a vertex's neighbors to update its own embedding. Different aggregation operators, such as sum, max, or product, can capture different types of interactions. For instance, sum aggregation can model additive interactions, while max aggregation can capture the most significant feature among neighbors, and product aggregation can model multiplicative interactions, which are particularly useful for capturing complex dependencies between vertices.\n\nUsing a product aggregation operator in GNNs is particularly advantageous because it allows the network to model interactions that are polynomial functions of the input features. This is significant because polynomial functions can capture a wide range of interactions, including those that are not easily modeled by simpler aggregation operators like sum or max. The polynomial nature of the interactions modeled by product aggregation makes GNNs more expressive and capable of capturing intricate relationships within the graph data.\n\nThe theoretical analysis of GNNs with product aggregation, using tensor network representations, provides a framework to understand and quantify the interactions modeled by these networks. This analysis can lead to practical insights, such as developing edge sparsification algorithms, which can improve the efficiency and performance of GNNs in real-world applications.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,62,57,172,60,58,177,5,175,176,64,180,173,179,9,59,178,186,3,65,63,71,174,74,67,204,86,76,142,203,202,68,69,72,79,82,78,84,53,4,196,40,8,41,80,85,77,81,144,184,190,23,25,183,83,187,182,7,35,193,87,88,181,13,27,50,75,167,39,89,36,70,147,33,26,52,205,14,92,21,22,42,195,11,185,54,141,188,96,24,44,66,146,38,206,12,29,32,51,189,95,56,197,55,143,148,151,149,191,100,199,132,16,49,20,119,121,122,128,47,109,159,43,105,18,37,171,201,19,150,192,34,90,94,125,133,138,30,48,111,170,198,46,17,91,15,97,158,45,120,126,200,93,194,10,168,118,145,156,2,31,103,104,164,1,153,161,28,108,110,129,154,163,98,160,123,112,169,106,107,130,134,135,139,115,131,124,137,152,113,116,136,140,162,155,127,157,99,101,165,114,166,102,117,6,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This topography significantly influences temperature changes, with higher altitudes experiencing cooler temperatures during summer and winter. The village is surrounded by the uMgungundlovu district, which is predominantly Zulu-speaking and relies on farming and livestock keeping as primary occupations. The climate in this region is characterized by distinct seasons: summer (December – March), winter (June – August), and spring (September – October), with average daytime temperatures ranging from 28°C in summer to 23°C in winter.\n\nIn comparison, Mbeere District in Kenya, located in Embu County, experiences a different climatic profile. The district lies between latitude 0° 20’ and 0° 50’ South and longitude 37°16’ and 37°56’ East, covering an area of 2,097 square kilometres. The terrain is arid and classified as an Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), with temperatures varying from 20ºC to 32ºC due to environmental factors and climatic conditions. The Mbeere community, predominantly farmers, specializes in growing crops such as melons, sorghum, maize, mangoes, pawpaws, millet, cowpeas, and beans. The arid climate and ASAL classification suggest that Mbeere District faces different agricultural challenges compared to Swayimane, such as water scarcity and higher temperatures, which may influence crop selection and farming practices.","source":"data/test/2405.10713.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[99,91,28,98,125,126,25,97,127,19,24,129,144,100,131,246,143,134,8,262,128,18,254,114,249,45,237,138,130,137,210,171,245,136,243,52,32,56,7,212,49,37,253,6,43,51,95,178,251,149,239,36,241,92,135,31,53,33,247,252,275,44,132,50,270,133,66,94,101,192,238,242,244,5,105,139,168,182,267,21,48,231,90,272,151,218,30,71,106,224,250,148,172,116,236,29,155,176,211,38,67,145,169,188,240,69,78,81,96,177,204,256,225,113,166,203,234,89,11,123,228,233,39,46,84,170,207,209,248,263,277,17,55,87,140,13,255,281,20,153,183,184,268,1,147,154,167,208,219,227,229,223,230,261,269,54,68,88,159,156,274,35,150,179,73,103,108,110,157,214,226,9,15,111,173,201,22,85,104,158,187,200,222,232,257,42,186,199,122,189,196,278,12,72,107,206,213,266,282,47,102,220,260,273,276,10,34,79,83,109,121,164,174,202,215,258,77,80,191,198,14,58,75,265,26,60,152,165,271,27,65,160,180,16,194,195,117,124,283,40,57,74,197,235,142,146,185,279,61,62,76,112,190,216,221,120,141,175,286,280,119,118,205,181,82,63,162,64,163,41,59,161,115,93,284,3,86,264,217,193,285,4,23,70,2,259],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

During the Long Rains, birds such as Kivuta mbura start making sounds, and the Ngoco bird nests along water banks. These behaviors suggest that the rainy season is approaching, with thunderstorms and severe weather conditions expected. Additionally, the sprouting of new leaves by cowpeas and the presence of cold temperatures at night indicate the onset of the rainy season.\n\nIn contrast, during the Dry Season, the flocking of the Thari bird is a sign of drought, with the Ngiri bird making noise, indicating dry conditions. The absence of these birds or their unusual behaviors can be used to predict the onset of the dry season. The Dry Season is characterized by high temperatures at night, windy conditions, and warm weather, with indicators such as Kamutuanjiru and midithu insects.\n\nThese behaviors can be used to predict weather changes by observing the presence or absence of these indicators. For instance, if the Kivuta mbura birds start making sounds and cowpeas sprout during the Long Rains, it suggests that the rainy season is imminent. Conversely, if the Thari bird flocking and Ngiri bird noise are observed during the Dry Season, it indicates that the dry season is likely to continue. These indicators help in making informed decisions about agricultural practices and resource management.","source":"data/test/2405.10713.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[136,138,137,52,267,126,132,100,262,99,134,256,19,28,33,91,50,125,92,51,90,148,135,171,24,18,32,133,49,130,97,8,25,114,151,242,129,149,96,128,154,168,56,95,103,227,111,224,66,150,246,172,218,241,113,178,204,247,89,156,21,249,263,31,39,177,245,98,29,36,48,53,152,101,179,253,254,22,37,67,127,147,182,139,169,230,268,78,81,102,231,243,105,106,157,212,239,17,87,145,258,270,38,116,226,271,275,34,63,71,201,94,167,170,183,255,260,35,84,122,155,175,180,166,189,265,110,176,223,278,20,46,68,173,228,232,234,238,11,43,44,45,206,272,75,237,12,42,252,273,281,16,200,225,251,277,199,184,233,250,30,117,191,207,229,261,55,153,159,203,205,6,54,144,174,244,274,123,192,1,9,72,74,279,47,69,121,240,276,60,131,213,215,158,188,190,208,236,266,235,248,219,282,62,65,76,221,7,195,73,77,222,57,59,210,165,193,284,10,269,27,146,283,142,162,202,140,186,80,160,220,85,108,26,79,211,41,196,197,163,280,64,164,198,216,14,58,181,40,194,124,88,143,185,109,104,120,214,15,141,5,187,93,13,118,209,286,119,115,83,107,217,82,61,112,23,70,161,257,3,4,86,259,2,285,264],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What are the primary challenges in defining and predicting drought, and how do these challenges impact the decision-making process for policymakers and scientists?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[43],"raw_output":"","pred":"The primary challenges in defining and predicting drought are its inherent variability and the lack of a precise, universally accepted definition. Drought is a complex natural phenomenon characterized by precipitation deficiency, which disrupts water supply to ecosystems. However, the recurrence of drought in susceptible areas is almost inevitable, making it difficult to predict with certainty. The absence of a clear definition has led to indecision and inaction among policymakers and scientists, hindering effective management and mitigation strategies.\n\nThese challenges impact decision-making by creating uncertainty and hindering the development of robust drought management plans. Policymakers and scientists struggle to allocate resources and implement effective interventions due to the unpredictability of drought occurrences. This uncertainty can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and increased vulnerability to drought impacts. Additionally, the variability in drought characteristics across different regions complicates the development of generalized drought prediction models, further exacerbating the challenges faced by decision-makers.","source":"data/test/2405.10713.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[179,31,43,229,32,33,35,52,8,81,183,30,111,53,103,34,203,228,9,102,38,227,225,46,170,54,101,128,92,49,90,223,41,99,127,16,71,135,139,224,36,56,130,246,168,173,44,75,95,114,254,37,74,110,243,245,267,39,148,50,67,91,122,178,55,231,184,201,22,84,177,226,234,66,174,219,263,244,17,57,126,176,230,256,29,125,169,89,147,182,232,258,123,137,175,1,21,51,87,249,100,171,189,261,266,72,204,149,151,205,19,45,134,138,180,218,237,20,40,42,105,212,262,281,188,247,48,145,96,167,260,10,28,47,181,12,191,146,154,166,251,253,206,265,11,24,238,268,192,77,116,242,58,94,250,68,113,119,142,190,200,240,271,6,60,85,120,13,69,159,83,236,275,78,198,65,248,172,97,239,282,132,199,208,272,121,124,196,270,285,88,15,241,18,152,79,115,155,117,252,82,108,210,136,7,73,195,233,259,5,64,76,133,220,141,156,193,59,283,150,284,158,70,98,276,277,62,214,153,215,25,61,104,221,235,269,26,207,213,3,160,187,202,14,80,129,144,185,157,255,93,216,222,194,106,118,143,140,217,273,63,109,164,197,211,286,209,257,279,27,86,112,131,278,2,186,163,274,161,162,165,107,4,264,280,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is evident from the DER values of 23.47% and 22.06% for the DH-dev and eval sets, respectively, which are much higher than the 8.16% and 8.64% for the 1240-hour training set.\n\nAfter fine-tuning, the performance improves substantially across all training data amounts. For instance, using 310 hours of training data results in a DER of 16.99%, which is still significantly higher than the 8.16% for the 1240-hour set. However, the improvement is most pronounced when using larger training sets. The 4961-hour and 7442-hour sets achieve DER values of 7.03% and 6.8%, respectively, which are very close to the best performance.\n\nThis suggests that while fine-tuning improves performance across all training data amounts, the effectiveness of fine-tuning is more pronounced with larger training sets.

The larger improvement suggests that fine-tuning on CH1 was more effective for EEND-EDA in adapting its model to the CH2 dataset.","source":"data/test/2407.08752.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[95,69,42,70,43,76,68,110,93,99,21,108,89,107,74,94,41,73,103,75,104,88,92,67,91,106,15,109,105,102,96,100,26,90,98,97,111,17,50,77,38,23,87,11,16,101,44,14,40,117,49,55,66,24,48,72,2,61,71,121,35,37,25,27,31,47,12,52,113,20,45,135,60,22,34,36,57,65,46,118,10,124,137,4,59,114,19,116,119,122,132,8,33,78,120,32,58,39,84,136,18,115,80,86,127,131,112,125,130,134,138,29,51,53,129,7,56,79,126,3,62,82,128,123,54,133,85,81,5,13,63,30,83,28,64,9,1,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This represents a difference of 0.94 percentage points.\n\nThe CHiME6 dataset is known for its challenging dinner-party scenarios, which are characterized by high percentages of overlapped speech. This makes it particularly difficult for diarization systems to accurately separate and identify speakers. The table notes that for corpora with very high percentages of overlapped speech, such as CHiME6 and DipCo, the DERs are the highest among all sets.\n\nThe larger discrepancy in DER for CHiME6 between the 8 kHz and 16 kHz models could be explained by the fact that the 16 kHz model likely has more frequency information available, which can be beneficial in distinguishing between overlapping speech signals. However, the 8 kHz model may still perform reasonably well due to its ability to capture the temporal dynamics of the speech, which is crucial in dinner-party scenarios. The 16 kHz model's advantage might be less pronounced in this specific dataset compared to others due to the inherent challenges of the CHiME6 scenario.","source":"data/test/2407.08752.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[73,44,93,69,43,108,109,42,95,106,107,110,111,68,70,89,41,76,90,92,104,103,35,98,105,37,87,100,94,74,91,38,67,88,16,15,23,2,102,60,99,40,71,24,25,55,96,46,66,75,114,14,26,59,78,80,138,72,11,101,112,97,4,12,27,131,86,45,61,36,84,19,22,130,30,3,39,21,51,124,5,31,34,18,113,8,17,65,120,28,137,117,123,47,50,52,58,125,136,119,57,127,135,62,132,13,54,79,10,49,118,122,126,64,116,48,133,20,115,121,63,129,1,134,29,32,128,82,81,83,56,85,53,33,77,6,7,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

Additionally, the work on probabilistic programming languages by Xiaodong Jia and Michael Mislove, and the study of coalgebra by Bart Jacobs, further enrich the landscape of theoretical computer science, complementing Kaarsgaard's focus on reversible computing.","source":"data/test/2406.07216.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[180,87,177,179,173,175,178,126,174,184,160,88,58,181,40,89,176,182,3,127,23,149,159,52,158,57,171,183,125,157,17,11,55,10,48,90,5,56,20,146,161,1,6,47,155,49,7,85,154,16,21,22,2,18,9,142,152,151,14,141,156,44,37,38,45,122,107,129,31,39,71,135,167,15,61,66,150,72,13,53,67,94,32,41,147,30,69,84,172,62,93,153,68,106,133,144,19,80,64,73,119,134,34,77,101,110,42,76,95,165,70,75,105,145,79,83,104,148,132,136,131,99,163,35,96,24,130,121,46,74,109,128,139,169,63,98,123,115,120,92,43,59,78,100,108,118,168,25,51,162,166,26,138,140,33,50,111,137,36,82,164,102,65,29,117,4,8,12,28,54,86,103,124,170,60,97,114,91,112,81,116,143,113,27],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What is the significance of the join inverse rig structure in the categorical interpretation of the programming language introduced in §4.2, and how does it relate to the concept of adequacy between operational and denotational semantics?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[142],"raw_output":"","pred":"The join inverse rig structure plays a crucial role in the categorical interpretation of the programming language introduced in §4.2. This structure allows for the definition of iso abstractions and pattern-matching, which are essential for ensuring reversibility in the language. Additionally, the DCPO (directed-complete partial order) enrichment enables the handling of recursive isos and inductive data types, which are represented using parameterized initial algebras. This categorical framework provides a robust foundation for the language's semantics.\n\nThe significance of this structure is further highlighted by the concept of adequacy, which establishes a strong link between the operational semantics and the denotational semantics of the language. Adequacy ensures that the denotational semantics accurately reflects the operational behavior of the language. Specifically, the theorem 4.29 states that a term \\( \\vdash t: A \\) is terminating if and only if its denotational interpretation \\( J \\vdash t: AK \\neq 0_1 \\), \\( JAK \\) is not the bottom element in the DCPO. This means that if a term reduces to a value, its denotational interpretation will not be the bottom element, indicating termination. Conversely, if the denotational interpretation is the bottom element, the term is either stuck due to pattern-matching or reduces in an infinite loop. This relationship between operational and denotational semantics is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the language.","source":"data/test/2406.07216.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[142,45,136,18,108,141,42,127,44,156,3,128,140,173,43,109,125,91,147,33,135,138,10,149,155,144,158,29,129,11,111,130,132,139,49,180,39,126,92,94,22,78,117,120,131,148,30,137,160,17,119,47,61,118,133,143,151,16,25,32,72,79,89,154,70,74,159,169,181,21,95,75,90,123,9,150,107,115,80,122,174,40,101,23,41,71,85,84,26,38,52,59,164,177,56,93,152,13,67,113,134,20,55,116,161,31,112,145,157,179,77,105,121,167,37,46,57,73,99,110,166,15,58,2,14,66,68,88,98,28,82,96,102,162,175,81,146,50,168,178,24,171,1,60,83,176,53,62,97,100,104,165,34,69,19,106,183,184,35,163,36,48,76,182,153,5,114,27,87,51,63,103,64,172,65,6,7,4,8,12,54,86,124,170],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This uniqueness is crucial for the well-definition and typing of Dup∅A as stated in Lemma 4.52 for several reasons:\n\n1. **Well-definition**: The uniqueness ensures that the duplication process is deterministic. For any given free-variable X, there is only one specific iso-variable ϕ that can be used to duplicate values of type A. This prevents ambiguity in the duplication process, ensuring that the same free-variable always corresponds to the same iso-variable, which is essential for the consistency and predictability of the duplication operation.\n\n2. **Well-typedness**: The uniqueness of the association between free-variables and iso-variables ensures that the resulting duplication iso is well-typed. Each duplication operation is correctly typed, as the iso-variable ϕ is uniquely defined for each free-variable X. This guarantees that the resulting duplication iso is valid within the type system, maintaining the integrity of the type structure.\n\nIn summary, the uniqueness of the association between free-variables and iso-variables ensures that the duplication process is both well-defined and well-typed, which is critical for the correctness and reliability of the duplication operation in the context of the given type system.","source":"data/test/2406.07216.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[150,139,136,154,132,31,140,148,166,131,129,138,80,116,162,106,134,151,113,137,149,167,43,120,141,38,40,42,82,143,95,165,169,100,110,115,133,163,164,84,168,39,41,44,47,83,98,108,109,111,112,118,147,27,79,81,142,145,121,161,37,97,107,26,29,36,61,68,96,104,130,30,63,102,105,49,67,75,119,144,155,45,60,74,101,135,152,46,59,66,153,28,77,78,128,50,71,93,114,160,32,35,51,94,33,34,70,73,146,158,99,58,117,21,53,91,159,52,22,90,57,76,11,72,122,25,62,126,64,85,178,16,56,92,174,10,23,69,15,175,65,180,9,157,183,127,176,177,17,182,184,20,89,156,88,125,18,24,55,103,13,14,48,181,5,173,179,171,87,1,172,2,19,7,123,3,6,4,8,12,54,86,124,170],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

If the dot product of `σedge` (the side of the edge at the root point that is nearer to the link) and `vedge` times `vdif` is greater than zero, the function generates a recursive trace from the point `pedge` and checks if it is in the occupied sector of the source point. If it is, the function places an Oc link. If not, it generates a new link with the target point `poc` and updates the existing link `l` with the new coordinates and direction.\n\nThis process ensures the integrity of the tracing algorithm by preventing the trace from entering the occupied sector of the root point or moving 180 degrees around the target point's occupied sector, thereby maintaining the correct path and avoiding redundant or incorrect traces.","source":"data/test/2408.05806.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[196,189,127,159,194,199,197,14,97,195,100,190,191,198,13,96,167,185,201,158,9,193,99,128,188,86,38,117,187,94,126,157,59,91,174,102,192,40,47,95,177,200,168,48,41,53,119,71,186,153,166,203,179,125,8,64,116,52,75,92,98,160,115,204,37,67,77,121,205,36,81,171,182,46,110,58,68,50,101,122,69,78,85,152,20,93,118,180,103,114,45,57,79,172,175,162,35,7,11,56,70,82,34,66,74,87,113,10,51,80,83,44,49,173,43,111,18,88,90,120,147,155,12,42,112,129,165,54,73,202,39,135,89,156,33,109,181,104,163,184,60,76,2,72,124,6,23,31,65,130,139,134,55,62,170,17,19,15,138,154,176,28,123,183,151,161,30,32,148,169,84,178,137,149,16,61,136,26,108,131,21,106,150,25,29,133,140,143,105,145,107,22,5,63,132,27,141,164,24,142,146,144,206,4,1,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"How does the concept of diagonal translation equivariance (DTE) differ from general (X × X)-translation equivariance, and what is the significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[82],"raw_output":"","pred":"Diagonal translation equivariance (DTE) is a specific type of translation equivariance where a function π is invariant under translations along the diagonal of the space X × X. This means that for any translation T(τ, τ) where τ is a vector in X, the function π remains unchanged. Mathematically, this is expressed as π ◦ T(τ, τ) = T(τ, τ) ◦ π for all τ ∈ X.\n\nIn contrast, general (X × X)-translation equivariance refers to a function π that is invariant under all translations in the space X × X, not just those along the diagonal. This means π remains unchanged under any translation (τ1, τ2) where τ1 and τ2 are vectors in X.\n\nThe significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9 is to leverage the properties of DTE to extend the equivariance to all translations in X × X. By duplicating the input (x, y) to (x, y, x, y), the function πdup becomes equivariant with respect to all translations in X × X. This duplication allows us to apply Theorem 4.8, which characterizes functions that are (X × X)-translation equivariant. By ensuring πdup is (X × X)-translation equivariant, we can then define π as π = πdup ◦ dup, where dup duplicates the input, and πdup is already known to be DTE. This approach simplifies the proof by breaking down the problem into manageable parts, first proving DTE and then extending it to full (X × X)-translation equivariance.","source":"data/test/2408.09583.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[83,80,12,81,98,207,97,101,20,7,71,77,45,79,212,76,78,84,210,85,89,93,30,92,209,82,94,108,13,206,226,9,11,35,28,211,96,129,44,75,73,130,39,72,208,111,145,74,176,46,47,201,225,90,6,99,200,136,19,153,95,159,86,154,150,198,48,177,42,88,117,55,120,161,213,215,17,87,119,65,91,104,174,191,10,122,187,172,181,223,36,124,193,205,60,166,216,8,18,43,54,163,203,214,52,64,68,121,173,56,15,37,49,123,160,202,53,66,116,197,220,139,147,196,67,164,38,109,110,138,158,183,194,70,106,152,50,58,63,107,146,188,219,100,149,167,186,192,4,41,102,118,125,221,25,168,61,62,112,115,189,190,218,57,128,142,69,184,175,113,126,135,199,29,34,105,171,178,51,140,204,222,40,114,127,26,180,195,151,185,23,24,103,133,162,169,59,137,155,170,131,132,141,182,143,148,157,31,179,134,156,27,144,16,32,2,3,21,5,33,14,22,165,1,217,224],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Here's how:\n\n1. The spaces A and Z are topological (X × X)-translation spaces, meaning they have a topology that respects translations in both coordinates.\n\n2. The extension π is defined on the product space A × {Tτc : τ ∈X × X}, which combines elements from A and the set of translations Tτc.\n\n3. The continuity of π relies on the continuity of the individual components of the extension. Specifically, it needs to show that π is continuous when restricted to each coordinate.\n\n4. The key step is to show that π is continuous when restricted to the set of translations Tτc. This is done by considering a sequence (ai, Tτic)i≥1 convergent to (a, Tτc).\n\n5. By using the continuity of the translations T−τ⊥ai and Tτ⊥ in A and Z respectively, and the continuity of π, it can be shown that the limit of π(ai, Tτic) as i→∞ equals π(a, Tτc).\n\n6. This relies on the fact that the translations T−τ⊥ai and Tτ⊥ are continuous in A and Z, and π is continuous in Z.\n\n7. Therefore, the continuity of A and Z ensures that the limit of the sequence (ai, Tτic) is correctly handled, proving the continuity of the extension π.\n\nIn essence, the topological structure of A and Z allows for the correct handling of limits involving translations, which is essential for proving the continuity of the extension π.","source":"data/test/2408.09583.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[208,207,75,81,54,78,84,83,79,187,188,191,206,37,74,57,203,204,77,96,189,36,72,82,192,199,212,216,159,202,205,44,45,56,73,60,94,201,209,42,64,65,80,97,38,55,62,76,158,210,16,61,195,196,213,41,51,52,63,211,214,215,198,102,53,59,190,68,193,67,89,98,43,58,90,93,99,91,150,194,92,160,39,200,17,106,219,95,104,18,50,66,88,186,22,27,49,169,223,15,103,176,25,115,87,217,71,180,220,147,226,28,85,137,173,185,197,35,178,182,181,26,30,114,139,19,24,138,157,175,218,5,105,179,166,145,29,47,86,101,142,162,174,23,183,184,225,40,46,70,146,170,109,129,130,172,177,110,113,111,221,31,32,144,149,151,116,4,34,48,120,123,156,6,124,154,164,167,33,107,136,155,168,13,108,121,161,20,69,163,8,9,222,112,141,140,135,153,171,12,117,122,119,128,152,7,118,127,134,148,126,133,100,2,3,21,143,1,125,165,11,10,14,131,132,224],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

They enable:\n\n- Improved communication and coordination between edge devices and services\n- Enhanced data interpretation and decision-making at the edge\n- More efficient resource allocation and task offloading\n- Better adaptation to dynamic and changing environments\n\nHowever, challenges could arise from implementing ontologies across various layers:\n\n- Consistency and interoperability issues between different ontologies\n- Scalability of ontology management and reasoning at the edge\n- Security and privacy concerns when sharing semantic information\n- Potential performance overhead of ontology-based processing\n- Ensuring ontologies remain up-to-date with evolving edge requirements and technologies\n\nAddressing these challenges will be crucial for realizing the full potential of ontology-based methods in edge computing.","source":"data/test/2405.17691.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[141,215,142,60,8,14,204,65,145,205,211,25,90,232,10,13,213,4,206,24,168,3,16,201,214,230,18,29,88,235,21,53,66,139,153,210,212,221,223,5,32,99,59,62,149,203,216,225,67,11,63,68,70,72,226,30,40,61,69,89,97,217,71,34,51,106,224,234,152,121,222,239,41,84,120,124,169,220,227,52,170,219,23,238,167,115,116,109,130,119,144,231,236,237,31,122,150,207,140,26,137,161,27,73,117,118,126,209,107,229,233,75,95,101,136,17,81,129,91,125,22,33,54,55,105,111,6,43,78,228,1,48,49,113,197,80,135,28,100,128,166,64,83,96,151,187,200,9,20,50,103,148,155,202,102,114,131,46,58,79,123,56,57,76,98,127,156,178,77,104,165,181,183,157,186,218,44,175,177,192,240,45,74,85,94,2,19,35,42,112,171,198,143,162,36,38,93,172,173,179,190,196,37,39,174,176,194,7,154,134,15,47,164,191,82,160,208,86,159,180,158,138,193,110,188,189,199,132,133,108,185,87,182,184,92,195,241,163,146,12,147],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What are the limitations of using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (ITSC) systems, and how do these limitations impact the model's performance in dynamic and data-scarce environments?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[37],"raw_output":"","pred":"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (ITSC) systems face several limitations that impact their performance, especially in dynamic and data-scarce environments. HMMs assume that the underlying system follows the Markov property, meaning the probability of transitioning to a new state depends only on the current state and not on the past states. This assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, particularly in dynamic environments where the system's behavior can be influenced by a long history of states and observations. For instance, traffic congestion can build up gradually, and the system's behavior may depend on the traffic conditions experienced over an extended period.\n\nAdditionally, HMMs heavily rely on sufficient training data to estimate model parameters accurately. In situations where data is scarce or noisy, the performance of HMMs may be compromised. This is particularly problematic in newly developed neighborhoods or areas with limited historical traffic data, where the HMM may struggle to accurately estimate the underlying traffic patterns and model parameters. Furthermore, HMMs may struggle with rare events that are not well-represented in the training data, such as major sporting events or large-scale construction projects, leading to ineffective handling of such events.\n\nThese limitations highlight the need for more robust and flexible models that can handle complex dependencies, context, and data scarcity in dynamic ITSC environments.","source":"data/test/2405.17691.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,36,39,43,56,38,44,45,62,210,213,40,55,5,52,42,58,47,139,18,41,137,53,22,49,50,152,30,214,13,34,61,239,20,21,46,64,151,240,24,51,48,32,65,219,228,140,148,224,113,66,14,117,215,226,35,105,115,235,67,155,206,225,3,68,59,230,8,57,156,161,233,80,110,81,138,207,141,236,31,220,221,222,25,234,63,157,164,19,237,4,198,17,26,60,160,218,229,9,75,180,227,232,153,205,231,116,144,201,203,208,73,204,163,191,23,74,103,196,238,149,162,165,188,209,101,159,33,166,2,10,193,197,200,150,154,183,168,7,106,217,223,28,6,29,69,142,211,78,79,98,178,212,11,100,16,54,158,174,173,192,145,111,172,70,90,118,119,184,167,189,202,130,88,89,186,135,169,179,187,194,176,199,27,120,132,143,216,72,136,171,122,112,175,104,170,91,102,185,190,134,114,121,83,87,124,195,97,126,177,241,109,86,93,107,99,127,71,182,77,94,1,96,85,123,128,181,82,108,129,133,146,125,95,76,84,147,131,92,15,12],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This suggests that the proximity of the nearest sample of another class has a more pronounced effect on the margin of samples with smaller max margins in MNISTlc.\n\nIn contrast, the relationship is weaker for the CIFAR10lc model.

The inability to fully describe model performance with small margin variations could hinder efforts to develop more robust training methods that improve adversarial robustness.\n\nIn summary, while margin-based measures may provide some insights, their limitations in capturing subtle performance variations suggest they may not be the most effective tool for predicting generalization or adversarial robustness in deep neural networks.","source":"data/test/2405.17445.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[123,17,143,16,19,3,145,6,4,78,34,22,32,73,104,31,18,46,139,103,12,35,101,136,7,131,132,140,146,5,20,25,44,70,135,26,144,147,29,71,83,80,120,137,30,36,84,110,111,41,81,24,28,138,47,124,99,79,27,33,150,21,42,45,82,100,23,114,39,141,40,112,113,148,149,66,122,77,105,98,13,64,10,130,37,97,119,142,69,49,95,43,48,76,118,11,60,116,72,96,125,161,38,55,15,94,63,102,158,53,54,121,1,9,52,107,153,155,59,62,92,117,88,50,157,68,74,106,160,162,58,65,67,115,156,51,61,87,91,163,108,154,56,8,90,75,109,159,86,93,126,57,129,89,152,165,127,85,151,134,128,14,164,2,133],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The wider spread of Gaussian samples (blue) indicates a higher likelihood of finding points close to the decision boundary, which is crucial for adversarial attacks.

Generating Gaussian samples requires more computation than uniform samples, especially for high-dimensional spaces like ImageNet.  Uniform sampling, while less effective at finding adversarial examples, is computationally cheaper.\n\nTherefore, in adversarial machine learning, the choice of sampling method depends on the specific requirements.  If computational resources are limited, uniform sampling might be preferred despite its lower effectiveness.  If finding adversarial examples is the primary goal, Gaussian sampling is likely more appropriate, even if it requires more computational effort.

The average SampleCov increases from 0.74 ± 0.26 when optimizing for IoU to 0.90 ± 0.19 when optimizing for Detection Accuracy. This suggests that optimizing for Detection Accuracy leads to a substantial improvement in the proportion of samples where there is an overlap between label annotations and neuron activation within the given activation range.\n\nThis improvement in SampleCov indicates that optimizing for Detection Accuracy enhances the algorithm's ability to correctly identify and align neuron activations with relevant label annotations across the dataset. This is crucial for ensuring that the explanations generated by the algorithm are not only accurate but also comprehensive, covering a wide range of samples.\n\nThe significant drop in other metrics, such as IoU, ExplCov, ActCov, and LabMask, suggests that optimizing for Detection Accuracy has a trade-off with these other metrics. For instance, the IoU score drops to 0.00 ± 0.00, indicating that optimizing for Detection Accuracy does not artificially inflate the overall score by increasing the formula's length. This trade-off highlights the complexity of optimizing multiple metrics simultaneously and underscores the importance of using a combination of metrics to evaluate the quality of neuron explanations comprehensively.","source":"data/test/2407.12243.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[111,104,66,51,79,110,13,14,80,67,52,108,55,78,11,22,57,68,93,76,92,65,86,87,7,44,145,10,81,94,95,107,33,50,106,38,53,116,21,98,113,34,96,41,43,84,39,69,118,136,82,151,27,32,77,83,129,137,8,18,20,46,58,75,42,64,90,147,149,60,105,133,24,40,112,140,144,56,127,159,70,121,128,54,109,138,141,150,19,36,37,97,120,122,124,158,35,91,119,71,89,134,3,26,31,85,117,125,135,143,123,139,142,154,157,28,153,155,17,49,62,115,131,152,48,63,74,148,132,100,146,30,73,99,156,59,47,16,72,25,15,29,114,12,101,1,2,45,130,61,103,5,88,102,126,6,9,4,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

For example, if a model uses background color to classify digits, as seen in the EfficientNetB0 model trained on CMNIST, memory inspection can expose this learned bias. This allows developers to identify and potentially correct such biases in the model.\n\n2. Understanding model decision-making: Memory inspection can provide insights into how the model is making decisions. For instance, in the SVHN and CIFAR10 examples shown in Figure 5.15, memory inspection reveals that the model focuses on specific features (shapes in SVHN, colors and backgrounds in CIFAR10) rather than the entire image. This can help developers understand the model's strengths and weaknesses, and potentially improve its performance by focusing on more relevant features.\n\nThese applications of memory inspection go beyond just improving accuracy, allowing for better model transparency, fairness, and interpretability.","source":"data/test/2407.12243.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[84,77,85,11,83,13,71,87,75,10,70,73,80,82,79,8,76,74,86,81,72,78,68,129,67,69,33,60,127,66,97,42,65,128,3,21,115,18,43,59,93,94,121,58,89,111,19,55,137,138,136,113,41,98,122,40,20,32,52,57,62,91,95,44,53,116,51,100,147,150,56,106,119,144,152,17,143,22,31,36,39,108,29,37,64,112,139,141,145,133,149,63,96,142,158,35,125,117,134,140,155,156,110,132,148,34,38,46,124,151,153,27,105,49,104,54,92,120,123,154,157,135,90,118,146,26,131,101,109,6,102,14,24,159,7,16,47,50,99,28,103,107,5,30,61,48,130,4,25,1,2,114,9,88,126,12,45,23,15],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The lack of temperature parameter for AWR indicates that it does not rely on temperature sampling, which is common in other objectives like RWR (Rewritten Reward).

In contrast, Google Translate's reliance on statistical patterns might have led to a slight deviation in the translation, resulting in a minor difference in the BLEU score despite the overall perfect match.","source":"data/test/2403.01580.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[192,54,103,104,105,109,111,182,58,152,195,25,82,194,53,113,170,46,49,70,185,224,16,161,187,26,31,32,39,92,17,171,191,19,86,206,6,78,72,73,96,100,149,35,67,87,153,4,63,64,223,226,5,40,57,110,180,41,200,159,179,193,15,18,84,88,3,68,163,181,38,214,219,160,205,71,8,177,216,47,122,151,81,155,196,12,33,34,65,102,1,52,128,167,202,221,69,85,220,30,112,115,28,29,45,56,183,189,62,148,60,156,74,176,48,99,50,51,229,90,162,204,116,188,107,197,24,43,80,154,136,168,203,61,135,77,93,157,173,174,184,217,158,166,10,22,91,106,123,37,97,165,169,209,14,228,227,11,21,178,199,231,55,232,27,147,198,137,190,218,42,101,138,79,133,139,140,186,59,143,210,215,23,44,89,130,132,150,164,230,172,175,213,118,211,141,212,222,127,207,124,98,13,225,83,142,9,95,134,36,201,120,144,117,126,129,119,66,108,7,20,94,131,208,75,121,145,114,146,76,125,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This discrepancy is significant, with a difference of 15.5 percentage points.\n\nSeveral factors could explain this difference. One possible reason is the quality and quantity of pre-training data used for each model. ChatGPT, being a closed-API model, likely has access to more comprehensive and diverse training data, which could contribute to its higher safety performance.

The loss function can be formulated as a combination of two terms:\n\n1. **Reconstruction Loss:** Minimize the difference between the observed data and the reconstructed data generated by the learned model. This ensures the model captures the data distribution.\n\n2. **Disentanglement Loss:**  This term encourages the latent representations to be independent and correspond to the intervened variables.  For perfect interventions, the disentanglement loss can be defined as the negative log-likelihood of the intervened variables given the un intervened variables.  For example, if we intervene on Z1, the loss would be -log(P(Z1|Z2, Z3)).  This encourages the model to learn Z1 as a function of Z2 and Z3, reflecting the causal relationship.\n\nThe limitations arise with imperfect or \"fat-hand\" interventions.  Imperfect interventions introduce noise, making it difficult to accurately estimate the intervened variables.  Fat-hand interventions, where multiple variables are intervened upon simultaneously, further complicate the disentanglement task.  In these cases, the disentanglement loss becomes less reliable, potentially leading to suboptimal representations.

For instance, in the first example, the unconditional beam search outputs \"The warehouse should not have been built so close to the residential building\" and \"The warehouse should not have been built so close to the residential building at first\", which are grammatically correct but incomplete. In contrast, the conditional beam search outputs \"The warehouse should not have been built so close to the residential building in the first place\" and \"The warehouse should not have been built so close to the residential building at the time of the incident\", which are more complete and grammatically correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the second example, the unconditional beam search outputs truncated sentences like \"For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response\" and \"For example, raw eating of 10 potatoes can lead to toxic effects\", while the conditional beam search outputs more complete and grammatically correct sentences like \"For example, 10 raw potatoes can cause toxicity\" and \"For example, eating 10 potatoes raw can cause toxic effects\".\n\nOverall, the conditional beam search seems to generate more fluent and grammatically correct outputs, especially for longer sentences, compared to the shorter, less complete sentences produced by unconditional beam search.

Specifically, it uses beam search completions from LLaMA-7B as training data, which are more representative of the types of inputs the classifier will see. However, this approach sacrifices some output validity because the training data is generated using beam search, which may not perfectly match the sampling distribution.

{"question":"How does the concept of typicality relate to the bad mode problem in the context of natural language generation, and why might atypicality sometimes be beneficial?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[47],"raw_output":"","pred":"The concept of typicality is crucial in understanding the bad mode problem in natural language generation (NLG). In the context of NLG, typicality refers to the likelihood of a sequence or attribute value being observed. A typical sample is one that is not much more or less likely to be observed than an average sample. Mathematically, this is defined by the typical set \\( S \\) for a random variable \\( X \\sim D \\) as:\n\n\\[ S = \\{ x | -\\log P_D(X = x) - H(X) < \\epsilon \\} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small value, and \\( H(X) \\) is the entropy of \\( X \\).\n\nThe bad mode problem arises when the most likely attribute value is not the same as the attribute value of the most likely string. This can be problematic because it means that the model might produce high-quality samples but still have a low-quality mode. For example, in text generation, the most likely sequence might be the empty string, even though the model is generating high-quality samples.\n\nAtypicality, on the other hand, can sometimes be beneficial. This occurs when the model needs to generate sequences that are not typical but are still useful or necessary for the task at hand. For instance, in generating creative or diverse outputs, the model might need to produce sequences that are not the most likely but are still high-quality and representative of the desired output space. This can be particularly useful in tasks where creativity and diversity are important, such as generating fictional stories or diverse responses in chatbots.","source":"data/test/2408.16241.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[46,48,83,47,53,64,86,45,15,42,57,62,59,89,49,18,60,51,52,17,44,22,13,50,78,25,87,6,12,65,88,19,24,71,7,16,54,56,81,85,43,68,116,31,41,77,28,72,66,27,75,10,38,91,101,34,76,84,4,2,11,26,63,69,94,55,30,61,70,111,80,103,23,99,58,39,8,3,20,29,74,82,93,40,100,14,21,95,33,102,110,36,92,98,105,96,114,97,109,115,37,32,35,112,90,73,104,118,9,79,1,106,117,5,67,113,108,107],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The conditional attention module thus plays a crucial role in enhancing the model's performance and ensuring that the generated summaries are more aligned with human perception standards.","source":"data/test/2408.14743.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[69,46,16,66,15,70,109,19,90,93,21,75,91,107,18,47,67,17,51,106,50,71,96,105,9,61,82,76,94,10,48,52,73,108,22,25,43,89,26,72,95,44,45,49,99,100,23,27,34,88,97,20,56,101,104,14,41,68,84,110,102,24,40,3,12,85,53,4,31,74,8,62,92,6,87,2,79,113,137,136,11,57,129,7,60,30,124,83,37,1,13,33,112,54,63,98,122,126,28,125,5,118,119,128,135,58,114,42,86,132,111,115,121,35,117,81,123,120,32,103,116,127,131,133,80,77,39,59,130,36,65,29,64,55,78,134,38],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How can self-attention mechanisms be leveraged to improve the interpretability and effectiveness of video summarization models, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies and hierarchical relationships within video sequences?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[121],"raw_output":"","pred":"Self-attention mechanisms significantly enhance video summarization by capturing long-range dependencies and hierarchical relationships within video sequences.  Traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle with long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem.  Self-attention, however, allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, effectively addressing this issue.  By attending to different parts of the input simultaneously, self-attention can capture complex relationships and dependencies that span across the entire video.\n\nFurthermore, self-attention can be extended to capture hierarchical relationships.  For instance, in a video summarization task, a higher-level summary might be constructed by attending to lower-level summaries of different segments. This hierarchical attention allows the model to build a multi-level representation of the video content, improving the overall interpretability and effectiveness of the summary.  By focusing on both long-range dependencies and hierarchical relationships, self-attention mechanisms enable more accurate and meaningful video summaries.\n","source":"data/test/2408.14743.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[121,72,18,49,91,17,126,46,66,50,74,48,73,24,75,26,47,61,43,67,88,108,85,90,96,117,87,115,20,25,127,69,92,105,45,94,100,109,110,111,16,114,128,14,44,118,9,22,97,125,3,23,124,56,82,93,132,15,70,95,107,129,10,53,89,4,51,120,19,83,52,71,113,106,40,104,112,119,27,31,41,42,98,99,11,57,131,76,122,62,123,5,133,21,54,84,102,135,28,12,60,116,8,68,2,7,136,34,58,63,137,13,30,32,79,39,101,103,1,33,81,6,37,130,64,35,36,59,86,65,55,134,29,80,77,38,78],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This implies that the output \\( o_B \\) is independent of the input \\( b \\) given the input \\( a \\) and the output \\( o_A \\), which is a key property of causal models.\n\nThe significance of this equation lies in its connection between the quantum circuit representation and the probabilistic representation of causal models. It shows that the quantum circuit can be interpreted as a causal model where the output \\( o_B \\) is determined by the input \\( a \\) and the intermediate output \\( o_A \\), rather than by the input \\( b \\).

Beta-binomial distributions are closely connected to order statistics, making them a natural choice for modeling P.\n\n**Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Beta-Binomial Representation:** Recognize that P(I(r) = J(s)) can be modeled using a beta-binomial distribution. The parameters of the beta-binomial distribution can be derived from the moments of the order statistics, specifically the mean and variance of the order statistics.\n\n2. **Order Statistics Moments:** Calculate the mean and variance of the order statistics (L(r) and L(s)) using the given formulas (2.36) and (2.37). These moments are crucial for determining the parameters of the beta-binomial distribution.\n\n3. **Beta-Binomial Parameters:** Use the method of moments to estimate the parameters α and β of the beta distribution that constitutes the beta-binomial distribution. The mean and variance of the beta distribution are related to the parameters α and β.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation:** Once the parameters of the beta-binomial distribution are determined, calculate the probability P(I(r) = J(s)) using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the beta-binomial distribution.\n\nThis approach simplifies the derivation by leveraging the well-understood properties of beta-binomial distributions and order statistics, avoiding the complexity of the direct derivation using the law of total probability and conditional probabilities.","source":"data/test/2405.03579.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[229,53,54,237,231,227,228,230,90,18,30,114,226,234,235,29,31,16,15,112,173,232,41,89,49,77,191,236,57,111,233,56,217,80,249,52,225,252,44,64,28,48,51,83,202,219,43,93,159,104,126,207,218,40,84,204,105,149,208,60,79,91,45,55,58,73,85,86,139,165,201,205,239,242,248,250,251,254,34,38,66,72,82,97,106,216,46,50,102,148,172,189,214,240,33,81,87,92,113,197,209,211,99,109,128,143,144,150,243,244,39,100,131,168,183,186,190,203,220,253,32,37,74,103,162,167,171,206,210,63,78,110,133,178,221,185,241,181,247,71,170,187,213,95,108,164,246,27,75,98,184,62,94,127,160,182,198,42,101,215,17,88,155,179,12,47,96,115,192,222,123,124,193,196,7,26,35,158,245,118,156,11,70,122,129,132,5,152,176,107,140,153,161,163,76,180,125,130,141,157,177,188,142,23,119,25,21,151,166,59,195,212,67,120,199,22,137,145,169,223,238,20,117,134,135,3,174,24,121,19,69,138,9,36,147,61,68,65,146,1,154,2,6,10,13,116,136,194,200,224,14,8,175,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}
{"question":"How does the value gained from digital experimentation and measurement (DEM) capabilities generally change as the capacity (M) increases, and what factor seems to most significantly influence this relationship across the different scenarios shown?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[63],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the plots shown in Figure 2.7, we can observe some key trends in how the value gained from digital experimentation and measurement (DEM) capabilities changes as the capacity (M) increases:\n\n1. For most scenarios, there is an initial increase in value gained as M increases from 10 to 100. This suggests that DEM capabilities become more valuable as the organization's capacity grows.\n\n2. However, the value gained tends to level off or even decrease slightly as M continues to increase beyond 100. This indicates diminishing returns on investment in DEM capabilities as capacity grows.\n\n3. The specific shape of the relationship (linear increase, diminishing returns) varies somewhat across scenarios, but generally follows this pattern.\n\nThe factor that most significantly influences this relationship appears to be the estimation noise before and after acquiring DEM capabilities. The plots show that scenarios with higher initial estimation noise (e.g. (1%)², (0.8%)²) tend to have more pronounced increases in value gained as M increases. Conversely, scenarios with lower initial noise (e.g. (0.6%)², (0.4%)²) show less dramatic changes in value gained with increasing M.\n\nThis suggests that the value of DEM capabilities is more pronounced when there is significant room for improvement in estimation accuracy. As noise is reduced, the incremental value of additional capacity diminishes.","source":"data/test/2405.03579.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,60,62,66,63,64,65,68,17,59,36,38,19,46,40,55,195,35,41,45,5,44,52,56,48,42,54,11,22,50,39,58,197,21,23,43,47,20,154,26,37,67,196,1,170,199,198,75,167,145,193,182,102,124,144,235,142,146,175,121,156,166,189,30,113,151,162,174,85,95,106,109,132,172,49,88,105,150,157,168,181,76,141,164,191,214,25,99,140,152,155,160,69,108,117,131,176,183,70,83,112,173,73,87,114,137,190,206,72,118,126,134,153,100,101,143,158,163,177,186,201,129,138,71,119,130,148,184,253,18,92,86,123,161,202,91,133,188,226,228,24,79,97,159,165,187,242,13,14,103,127,149,169,171,185,221,93,192,225,227,231,236,249,128,230,15,96,104,107,237,250,4,7,211,218,12,207,3,135,147,212,213,238,243,57,115,120,217,229,241,244,9,29,74,98,81,82,125,180,205,220,203,210,222,8,28,178,234,247,252,2,6,10,16,116,122,136,194,200,204,224,239,251,33,78,94,209,240,34,51,80,208,216,232,31,179,245,223,53,215,248,219,32,90,77,246,233,254,84,89,110,139,111,27],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1}]}

In the context of a company deciding between developing a new product feature or enhancing an existing one, this principle can be applied as follows:\n\n1. **Estimation Noise:**  The company has limited data on the potential impact of each option.  Developing a new feature might yield a high estimate of value, but the uncertainty is high due to the lack of historical data.  Enhancing an existing feature, while potentially less exciting, might have a lower estimate but with lower uncertainty.\n\n2. **Prioritization:**  If the company prioritizes based on noisy estimates, it might erroneously prioritize the new feature, thinking it offers the highest value, even though the existing feature might be more reliable and offer a consistent improvement.\n\n3. **DEM Capabilities:**  Implementing DEM capabilities would reduce the estimation noise.  The company could run controlled experiments to gather more accurate data on the impact of each option.  This would allow for more informed prioritization, potentially leading to better long-term decision-making.\n\n4. **Risk Management:**  DEM capabilities also enable the company to manage the risk associated with prioritization errors.

{"question":"How does changing the lengthscale parameter ψ in the random Fourier basis affect the smoothness and flexibility of the generated functions compared to the affine basis?

A larger ψ value leads to smoother functions, as the model places more weight on higher-frequency components, which are less sensitive to small changes in the input. This results in functions that are more likely to be globally smooth and less prone to overfitting. Conversely, a smaller ψ value allows for more flexible, less smooth functions, as the model emphasizes lower-frequency components, which can capture more local variations and details in the data.\n\nThe relationship between ψ and the model's ability to fit different types of data is crucial. For data that is inherently smooth and does not require high-frequency details, a larger ψ is more appropriate, as it ensures that the model remains simple and generalizable. On the other hand, for data with complex, non-smooth patterns, a smaller ψ is necessary to capture the necessary details without overfitting. The optimal ψ value depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired balance between model complexity and fit.","source":"data/test/2404.19157.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[29,28,30,50,51,33,32,47,36,96,26,10,31,39,40,69,43,204,25,54,105,57,175,98,176,198,115,153,53,35,62,72,100,108,123,52,34,120,135,165,38,139,155,224,112,122,46,58,59,93,101,113,119,128,133,142,194,110,114,141,149,44,127,148,150,151,97,106,136,137,177,201,19,55,64,71,84,88,95,158,180,41,107,156,169,173,181,183,27,70,79,104,131,174,185,222,18,68,74,77,82,130,134,143,152,171,197,12,37,67,94,125,144,48,103,154,160,167,199,203,219,42,102,138,145,146,147,164,193,65,66,124,126,170,178,208,220,49,56,129,159,163,192,223,233,9,20,61,140,157,179,186,210,216,45,73,75,80,87,92,162,172,213,60,86,89,99,161,188,215,221,196,78,90,132,206,214,226,231,117,211,212,217,7,76,11,21,81,209,22,85,168,205,218,8,63,195,225,232,184,207,17,23,83,109,227,166,182,200,230,16,229,91,121,187,15,13,118,24,189,190,111,191,1,5,2,4,6,14,116,228,234,202,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"How does the computational complexity of a depthwise separable convolution compare to that of a standard convolution, and what design trade-offs are involved in choosing one over the other in the context of building efficient convolutional neural networks?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[16],"raw_output":"","pred":"Depthwise separable convolutions offer a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to standard convolutions. While standard convolutions involve multiplying the entire input with the entire kernel, depthwise separable convolutions break this down into two steps: a depthwise convolution, which applies a 1x1 kernel to each input channel independently, and a pointwise convolution, which combines the outputs of the depthwise convolution. This separation reduces the number of multiplications required, making depthwise separable convolutions more efficient.\n\nIn the context of building efficient convolutional neural networks, the choice between standard and depthwise separable convolutions involves several design trade-offs. Standard convolutions provide more expressive power and can capture complex features, but they are computationally expensive. Depthwise separable convolutions, on the other hand, are computationally efficient but may not capture as complex features as standard convolutions.

This could be attributed to MSCEqF's ability to handle equivariant errors more effectively, leading to more accurate and consistent trajectory estimation across varying conditions.\n","source":"data/test/2407.14297.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[150,148,145,146,149,15,14,143,152,9,147,160,72,112,24,151,158,111,133,172,107,153,114,11,154,75,74,77,141,22,110,113,125,131,157,127,128,137,6,108,126,119,132,73,94,95,130,155,78,142,156,16,117,68,105,180,52,93,116,76,82,96,139,13,55,58,104,106,100,136,86,161,173,134,176,71,138,10,49,97,98,129,8,41,59,62,79,17,37,53,54,89,103,169,170,1,36,57,91,101,102,124,177,20,32,43,115,165,179,44,51,60,83,99,121,122,19,118,171,135,166,178,5,123,26,38,39,40,65,175,25,70,90,140,174,63,67,144,23,61,66,84,87,7,69,163,28,64,120,33,34,45,109,50,18,35,85,164,48,92,46,162,159,21,42,80,31,81,12,29,88,4,168,47,27,167,56,30,3,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

{"question":"What are the key differences between the classical EKF error and the equivariant error in the context of systems posed on manifolds, and how does the equivariant error provide an advantage in the design of the equivariant filter algorithm?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[51],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key differences between the classical EKF error and the equivariant error in the context of systems posed on manifolds lie in their definitions and the way they handle the geometry of the system. The classical EKF error, \\( e = \\xi - \\hat{\\xi} \\), is defined in local coordinates centered around the time-varying state estimate \\(\\hat{\\xi}(t)\\). This means that the error is constructed using coordinates that change along the trajectory, leading to varying local coordinates and potentially higher linearization errors.\n\nIn contrast, the equivariant error, \\( e = \\phi(\\hat{X}^{-1}, \\xi) \\), is globally defined and does not rely on local coordinates. It is constructed by considering the element of the symmetry group \\(\\hat{X} \\in G\\) and the element of the state space \\(\\xi \\in M\\), defined in a neighborhood of a fixed point \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\). This global definition ensures that the error kinematics are linearized about a single set of coordinates, which is a significant advantage over the classical EKF.\n\nThe equivariant error provides an advantage in the design of the equivariant filter algorithm because it simplifies the estimation problem by maintaining a consistent set of coordinates. This consistency leads to more accurate linearization of the error dynamics and the output measurement, which is crucial for the performance of the filter. By leveraging the symmetry of the system, the equivariant error ensures that the filter can more effectively handle the geometry of the system, leading to improved estimation accuracy and robustness.","source":"data/test/2407.14297.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[51,58,50,49,59,67,123,94,179,130,52,80,9,93,46,159,17,107,86,8,20,162,11,44,172,23,111,24,48,161,57,117,119,136,157,54,135,6,22,66,137,141,156,13,68,79,126,177,60,16,53,152,155,47,115,150,164,82,118,158,98,132,62,163,173,89,112,114,133,142,109,154,5,85,87,128,144,149,71,176,21,91,105,127,139,140,96,160,83,131,146,153,10,18,108,1,88,102,122,143,65,92,110,129,138,147,55,56,63,113,148,151,14,101,12,97,125,134,178,45,84,145,90,106,95,99,103,78,170,100,120,121,81,104,124,116,174,33,74,77,180,15,32,19,72,73,166,75,169,171,29,76,28,69,175,31,27,70,168,37,39,35,41,38,42,36,4,7,25,64,167,40,61,43,26,30,34,165,2,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The ground truth trajectories (blue) are hidden during training, but OTNet effectively models the underlying patterns and distributions, as evidenced by the generated trajectories closely matching the unseen test environment.\n\nIn contrast, the nearest neighbour model, represented by blue trajectories, transfers trajectories from the most similar training map. This approach is limited in its ability to adapt to new environments because it relies solely on the most similar training data, which may not capture the full range of possible trajectories.

Limitations include the computational cost of generating multiple trajectories and the need for a diverse training dataset to capture all possible trajectories.\n\nThe nearest neighbour model, while simple and computationally efficient, lacks the ability to generate new trajectories and is highly dependent on the similarity of the training data to the new environment.

Hausdorff distance: OTNet has the lowest Hausdorff distance of 1.98, indicating it generates trajectories that are closest to the ground truth trajectories.\n\n2. Frechet distance: OTNet has the lowest Frechet distance of 2.13, suggesting it produces trajectories that are most similar to the ground truth in terms of overall shape and path.\n\n3. ANLL: OTNet has the lowest ANLL of 29.83, which is a measure of the model's ability to capture the distribution of trajectories.\n\nHowever, there are potential trade-offs to consider between OTNet and the k-NN approach:\n\n1. Diversity: OTNet may generate more diverse trajectories compared to k-NN, which simply transfers trajectories from the nearest map. This could be beneficial for exploring new motion possibilities, but may also introduce some noise or less accurate predictions.\n\n2. Computational efficiency: While OTNet can generate trajectories quickly, k-NN may be faster for generating single trajectories. However, k-NN lacks the ability to generate distributions of trajectories.\n\n3. Generalization: OTNet may generalize better to new environments, as it can generate trajectories that are not directly present in the training data. k-NN relies on existing trajectories and may struggle with novel scenarios.\n\n4. Overconfidence: OTNet may be more confident in its predictions, as it can generate multiple trajectories and assess their likelihood. k-NN may overestimate the accuracy of its single prediction.\n\nIn summary, OTNet offers superior performance across metrics but may have trade-offs in terms of diversity, computational efficiency, generalization, and overconfidence compared to k-NN.","source":"data/test/2407.10383.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[123,22,143,121,122,169,89,107,69,86,191,66,125,84,83,142,11,85,67,70,167,168,188,145,21,81,196,105,147,192,104,186,120,119,126,17,5,20,211,206,166,189,15,82,103,18,170,26,141,214,65,68,139,144,10,112,80,113,176,117,3,16,53,118,185,6,41,124,212,73,136,87,183,194,29,40,75,90,94,132,187,197,213,88,106,111,209,210,218,31,35,36,59,74,95,151,93,182,201,203,207,216,217,4,8,37,76,99,128,25,97,116,43,102,131,138,180,204,109,134,154,205,208,34,39,42,108,115,202,33,38,44,58,100,101,133,193,215,110,160,195,98,130,200,56,60,79,127,150,92,129,135,174,27,52,114,148,179,199,14,24,32,48,63,153,57,64,77,140,162,171,173,62,159,46,51,165,7,9,12,13,30,71,137,152,178,19,78,177,23,28,54,161,198,96,61,146,156,47,184,50,163,72,175,49,190,91,157,158,2,45,172,181,155,164,55,149,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Overall, the results indicate that slightly more females participated in both the interviews and online survey, with a very minor difference in the number of participants between genders.","source":"data/test/2406.15375.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[275,184,288,294,278,284,277,281,290,286,188,293,295,291,182,289,189,187,298,279,297,287,183,283,285,194,196,282,14,192,217,186,292,300,190,301,276,195,16,185,302,280,316,191,334,193,299,211,203,335,13,303,317,323,333,152,318,330,331,11,145,148,296,309,319,314,327,179,181,307,321,328,178,339,308,310,315,320,322,324,85,311,312,329,332,9,207,341,237,88,149,270,326,338,340,141,230,336,325,346,39,40,221,313,342,349,119,234,180,218,337,347,348,84,10,94,140,164,259,306,344,78,224,235,151,166,345,15,117,206,208,219,261,126,176,353,171,212,343,24,150,350,147,159,177,220,223,95,161,202,240,48,135,156,205,257,4,104,160,209,231,239,65,92,101,146,248,31,32,41,67,75,143,222,63,162,233,351,8,64,118,125,18,249,2,68,163,255,258,66,74,86,168,247,83,123,155,225,252,253,273,304,106,129,272,62,87,153,251,256,12,28,97,271,76,120,167,266,25,44,61,213,246,23,33,34,37,116,244,254,260,305,127,134,138,144,165,204,173,43,77,102,122,136,269,49,57,72,115,137,158,243,268,80,107,128,130,229,355,36,90,175,226,241,242,250,35,265,73,89,114,198,51,91,96,262,6,22,58,98,99,108,245,46,47,109,113,139,228,19,53,56,112,121,263,71,132,133,274,45,105,154,267,7,50,142,197,236,21,70,199,216,1,100,200,201,214,264,20,26,42,157,354,232,27,54,55,103,227,69,124,79,81,169,38,52,93,131,210,82,174,215,3,5,352,29,60,30,59,170,172,111,17,110,238],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is a count of how frequently a specific concept or theme has been identified across all the coded segments.\n\nThe relationship between these two columns is significant for analyzing the interview data in several ways:\n\n1. It allows researchers to assess how thoroughly they have coded the data. A high coverage value suggests most of the data has been analyzed, while a low value may indicate gaps in the analysis.\n\n2. It helps identify which themes or concepts are most prominent in the data. A high number of coding references for a particular code indicates that theme is well-represented across the interviews.\n\n3. It enables researchers to evaluate the consistency of coding across different interviewees. Comparing coverage and coding references between participants can reveal patterns or differences in how themes are discussed.\n\n4. It provides a basis for determining when data saturation has been reached - when coverage is high and coding references are stable, it may indicate that key themes have been adequately captured.\n\nBy examining these metrics together, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the interview data and ensure they have thoroughly analyzed the material.","source":"data/test/2406.15375.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[314,327,333,337,318,330,329,309,338,350,317,332,334,340,346,308,313,336,319,343,348,349,316,323,307,311,315,326,328,335,310,321,322,325,331,345,342,320,306,344,339,347,312,204,97,136,279,206,40,117,118,159,324,11,301,9,191,125,122,276,82,87,115,146,144,156,341,66,123,16,65,135,54,70,165,78,124,139,158,249,293,8,93,94,148,231,244,287,302,44,98,210,305,31,41,57,63,121,138,175,283,289,10,25,100,162,189,245,286,303,304,152,164,205,272,290,351,77,90,257,280,282,300,72,112,134,142,181,190,219,291,53,89,143,292,45,56,92,109,145,203,256,83,126,177,183,196,247,7,15,37,85,157,193,207,220,13,64,111,163,176,195,217,67,180,184,211,224,232,354,14,33,62,155,178,208,236,275,299,110,151,179,234,277,294,61,76,149,161,212,228,46,47,150,200,225,258,298,167,174,222,241,154,202,263,267,352,75,86,209,254,19,28,88,264,52,60,81,106,182,288,235,281,295,353,12,58,71,80,274,201,260,261,4,50,116,141,230,2,38,237,297,36,114,173,221,233,262,296,32,79,137,192,259,35,95,119,197,129,187,218,248,253,266,34,43,69,120,147,160,172,170,30,96,226,239,273,285,99,107,131,140,255,39,252,265,284,108,213,229,240,22,68,101,186,74,166,243,269,271,127,132,223,355,238,246,51,59,128,20,130,102,251,23,84,198,29,168,227,18,24,103,214,242,250,26,48,153,169,268,5,104,27,91,17,73,171,21,194,215,216,6,278,133,270,185,1,188,55,113,42,49,3,199,105],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Firstly, it can accelerate the implementation of e-services by leveraging the private sector's expertise, resources, and innovative solutions. This partnership can also enhance the quality and efficiency of e-government services, making them more accessible and user-friendly. Additionally, the private sector's involvement can help in addressing the financial constraints faced by local governments, thereby ensuring sustainable and scalable e-government initiatives.\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. One significant challenge is the risk of corruption, as highlighted by Participant 2. The private sector's involvement might introduce conflicts of interest, leading to unethical practices and mismanagement of public funds. Another concern is the potential for the private sector to prioritize profit over public service, which could compromise the quality and accessibility of e-government services. Furthermore, the integration of private sector solutions might require significant upfront costs and technical expertise, which could be challenging for local governments to manage.\n\nOverall, while the private sector can significantly enhance the deployment and adoption of e-government services, careful monitoring and regulatory frameworks are necessary to mitigate potential risks and ensure that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.","source":"data/test/2406.15375.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[285,261,314,237,191,233,173,211,236,264,18,195,280,61,336,198,219,226,268,277,294,2,94,35,69,117,178,203,217,220,223,232,235,265,273,281,284,41,126,166,32,140,109,187,221,40,225,279,275,286,106,201,202,73,190,230,152,182,229,29,36,129,167,193,227,295,14,22,28,179,263,282,180,189,200,269,8,128,177,208,231,68,95,176,212,224,96,172,192,119,197,199,234,287,58,353,66,214,222,312,27,316,328,20,186,260,266,334,348,23,31,228,297,315,339,288,323,338,67,318,10,115,154,283,306,351,118,169,272,335,12,13,112,114,194,292,308,38,249,256,341,347,62,72,164,340,320,325,331,1,24,330,15,207,298,33,168,253,344,350,39,104,185,44,107,181,248,276,6,56,34,63,64,75,84,196,307,43,65,301,317,175,245,85,311,26,103,213,252,302,21,60,127,183,209,240,293,174,218,46,153,158,170,309,326,345,47,239,241,332,7,16,147,342,45,102,110,143,86,278,171,250,313,49,57,111,296,300,310,149,243,322,333,108,254,141,251,355,76,98,291,321,238,59,188,259,290,327,271,303,101,247,304,255,19,113,324,25,78,258,319,329,70,246,9,155,162,216,55,244,257,346,74,77,89,51,130,133,151,79,100,148,42,99,242,349,91,337,71,343,90,138,299,37,88,210,215,48,161,53,54,92,93,97,146,30,289,160,137,142,80,4,50,132,156,204,52,81,144,163,184,121,157,159,122,11,17,150,87,267,123,135,131,105,120,274,270,125,205,82,139,165,83,206,116,262,136,354,352,134,145,124,3,305,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As d increases from 0 to 2, MRE decreases, indicating improved performance. However, when d increases further to 4, MRE increases again, suggesting that too many divisions may negatively impact accuracy.\n\nFor Lrzip (Figure 5.4b), the relationship is more complex. While there is an initial decrease in MRE as d increases from 0 to 2, the MRE then increases again when d is set to 4. This suggests that Lrzip may benefit from a moderate number of divisions, but too many divisions can still lead to performance degradation.\n\nThe key difference between SQLite and Lrzip is that SQLite shows a more pronounced U-shaped relationship, with a clear optimal point at d=2. In contrast, Lrzip's relationship is less clear-cut, with a more gradual increase in MRE as d increases beyond 2.\n\nThese observations highlight that the optimal depth d for handling sample sparsity varies between different software systems, and finding the best d requires careful experimentation.

Provide examples from at least three different references to support your explanation.","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[127],"raw_output":"","pred":"Sparsity in configuration data implies that only a subset of options, factors, or knobs significantly impact the performance of a software system. This sparsity can lead to challenges in machine learning models, as they must efficiently identify and utilize the relevant features while ignoring the noise introduced by redundant or irrelevant data. The implications include reduced model accuracy and applicability, as well as increased computational overhead due to unnecessary data processing.\n\nDifferent studies characterize sparsity in various ways:\n\n1. **Configuration Options**: Siegmund et al. (2015) found that only one-third of the options significantly contribute to system performance, indicating a sparse distribution of influential options. This sparsity is also observed in the work of Jamshidi & Casale (2016), where low-order interactions among a few dominating factors explain the main changes in the response function.\n\n2. **Configuration Primitives and Inputs**: Chen & Bahsoon (2017a) highlight that too many inputs can introduce noise and redundancy, leading to a sparse set of relevant inputs for modeling. This sparsity is crucial for optimizing the model's accuracy and reducing unnecessary overhead.\n\n3. **Configuration Flags**: Ha & Zhang (2019b) note that Fourier coefficients of software performance functions are sparse, meaning only a small number of configurations significantly impact system performance. This sparsity is also observed in the work of Chen et al.

(2021)?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[256],"raw_output":"","pred":"Velez et al. (2021) explore the use of white-box analysis over machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems. The key differences and potential advantages of white-box analysis include:\n\n1. **Transparency and Explainability**: White-box analysis provides a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms and dependencies within the system. This transparency allows for easier debugging, maintenance, and modification of the model, which is crucial for complex and configurable systems.\n\n2. **Interpretability**: White-box models are more interpretable, meaning that the factors influencing performance can be directly identified and understood. This interpretability is essential for stakeholders who need to make informed decisions based on the model's predictions.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: White-box models can be more efficient in terms of computational resources and time, as they do not require extensive training data or complex algorithms. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in scenarios where real-time performance prediction is necessary.\n\n4. **Robustness**: White-box models can be more robust to changes in the system's configuration, as the model's structure is based on the inherent properties of the system. This robustness ensures that the model remains effective even as the system evolves.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: White-box models can be easily adapted to new configurations or scenarios, as the underlying logic can be modified without the need for retraining. This flexibility is advantageous in dynamic environments where system configurations may change frequently.\n\nOverall, white-box analysis offers a more transparent, interpretable, and efficient approach to modeling the performance of configurable systems, making it a valuable alternative to machine learning methods.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[256,211,242,173,212,122,172,23,177,176,180,103,191,86,102,214,96,117,95,258,130,193,251,239,178,209,243,99,19,58,74,101,128,250,132,22,59,231,240,129,65,210,234,40,51,100,213,87,56,85,104,229,246,253,60,61,260,237,144,232,235,245,255,31,151,254,257,54,119,179,236,18,20,45,79,90,157,247,52,55,69,125,148,230,244,53,57,75,116,261,76,94,155,249,63,64,105,123,134,80,67,83,106,127,146,238,2,26,32,72,78,81,88,140,203,223,112,241,49,126,169,204,259,12,68,115,136,252,43,62,66,77,215,248,8,70,84,111,174,200,21,48,156,170,71,124,147,9,29,33,150,166,3,7,168,195,25,98,207,233,14,37,143,153,121,189,192,197,5,208,222,224,82,113,152,199,225,227,92,110,137,139,161,220,226,30,44,50,97,108,202,47,131,145,186,194,114,142,163,167,175,228,107,109,120,149,184,188,41,185,11,15,133,138,162,165,190,263,91,24,181,196,274,13,118,154,158,160,217,73,135,164,264,27,39,42,89,201,159,46,187,28,183,216,218,221,6,171,93,182,35,198,141,206,267,273,205,1,219,266,271,4,262,38,265,36,272,16,269,268,10,34,270,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

For Young Adults II, the mean age is 30.77 (SD 4.46) in FG1 and 34.3 (SD 4.42) in FG2. \n\nThis consistency suggests that the age distribution within these groups is relatively stable across the two sessions. The slight increase in mean age and standard deviation in FG2 for both groups indicates a slight shift towards older participants, but the overall age range remains within the specified age ranges (18-25 for Young Adults I and 26-40 for Young Adults II). This stability in age distribution helps ensure that the focus groups are representative of their respective age groups, allowing for meaningful comparisons and insights into the behavior of smartphone use in social settings.","source":"data/test/2405.13465.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[43,55,115,60,56,86,101,119,48,118,57,117,44,39,21,92,127,46,138,20,59,103,27,87,41,83,10,24,63,88,42,54,100,126,84,85,147,47,53,58,93,116,129,149,64,35,61,82,91,128,16,38,45,68,6,66,89,90,120,79,34,71,81,107,110,23,145,52,139,136,98,111,134,18,22,77,108,112,152,123,141,19,28,29,33,62,102,113,121,137,144,17,32,109,25,76,106,122,130,140,146,65,124,131,132,156,4,9,125,150,154,78,95,26,133,7,142,1,15,31,37,73,99,135,143,5,30,49,69,97,151,8,12,148,153,11,2,50,74,80,155,36,104,157,94,114,105,14,75,51,70,67,96,40,72,13,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

These unintended outcomes arise from the ambiguous and implicit nature of such interventions, which can disturb users and create frustration. For instance, the WHISPER prototype, designed to increase interaction quality, can lead to negative reactions if users perceive the intervention as intrusive or unnecessary. This unpredictability challenges the ethical considerations in persuasive technology design, as it involves balancing intended benefits with potential harms.\n\nThe complexity of measuring social interaction quality stems from its subjective nature. While objective metrics like conversation volume and gaze direction have been used, these do not fully capture the nuanced aspects of social interaction, such as the pleasure derived from the moment or the satisfaction post-interaction. The thesis suggests that future research should explore more comprehensive methods to measure social interaction quality, considering both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. This includes developing more sophisticated sensors and algorithms that can better understand and quantify the subjective experiences of users during social interactions.","source":"data/test/2405.13465.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[133,4,131,132,91,135,136,137,81,16,134,21,89,22,17,92,126,149,44,54,60,79,87,53,106,20,104,61,111,83,76,108,36,7,45,42,82,107,41,19,52,90,34,43,124,88,125,29,59,112,47,110,138,37,39,49,14,38,93,120,50,140,95,146,18,64,121,141,148,84,58,27,32,9,46,69,129,130,15,62,66,127,68,103,25,109,35,67,31,11,1,8,26,48,94,100,28,5,150,65,85,117,147,57,55,70,30,116,123,56,128,33,51,122,119,143,2,23,144,155,13,105,71,102,139,157,86,145,63,142,6,96,12,73,156,80,118,40,78,98,101,153,115,152,75,72,74,77,99,24,97,151,3,154,10,114,113],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Firstly, the company's long-term success depends on the selection, design, and execution of appropriate business strategies. If these strategies are not effective, it could hinder the company's growth and profitability. Secondly, the company's investments in enhancing the customer experience through drive-thru options require significant capital expenditures, which may not generate the expected returns, potentially affecting its financial performance. Thirdly, the company's primary growth strategy is highly dependent on the availability of suitable locations and its ability to develop and open new Shacks on a timely basis and on terms attractive to the company. Delays or difficulties in opening new Shacks could negatively impact sales and profitability. Additionally, the company's expansion into new domestic markets may present increased risks, affecting profitability. Failure to manage growth effectively could harm the company's business and operating results. New Shacks may not be profitable, and this could negatively affect Shack sales at existing Shacks. If the company fails to maintain its corporate culture, it could negatively impact relationships with team members and guests. Furthermore, the company's marketing strategies and channels may evolve, and if these programs are not successful, it could lead to increased marketing expenditures without the benefit of higher revenues. These risks, if not managed effectively, could significantly impact Shake Shack Inc.'s financial performance and reputation.","source":"data/test/NYSE_SHAK_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[32,34,38,46,13,40,33,39,41,36,25,54,49,86,35,44,48,27,29,43,47,30,52,7,81,5,45,26,88,15,11,85,63,73,67,28,66,18,134,23,90,72,93,6,50,78,17,31,94,79,19,74,22,77,14,21,91,101,137,3,16,76,89,149,62,70,112,123,57,113,2,99,114,9,84,92,96,103,120,51,108,109,111,102,131,10,80,100,8,75,20,71,110,127,141,151,37,42,69,118,128,132,135,68,95,97,107,116,136,152,105,130,144,122,126,143,154,24,160,53,64,119,106,115,60,1,121,133,138,56,139,140,145,161,117,148,156,124,125,155,142,147,104,61,65,129,150,157,158,87,98,153,4,59,58,55,82,146,159,83,12],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Firstly, the breach could result in the indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to its stated maturity, which could lead to financial strain and potential default. Secondly, the company may be required to pay the principal or interest of the debt when due and payable, after giving effect to any applicable grace periods. Additionally, the company could face legal and financial penalties, including fines or penalties imposed by regulatory bodies.\n\nRegarding Event of Default Notices, the company is obligated to deliver a written notice of any Event of Default within two Business Days via electronic mail and overnight courier. This notice is in addition to, and cannot be substituted by, the Trustee’s delivery of the same notice. The timely delivery of this notice is crucial as it triggers the Holder’s redemption rights. If the Holder receives the Event of Default Notice or becomes aware of the Event of Default before the Company’s notice, the Holder may require the Company to redeem the Note, regardless of whether the Event of Default has been cured.

The purpose of each provision - Section 10.16 establishes the governing law and jurisdiction, while Section 10.18 addresses performance issues.\n\n2.

Firstly, the company experienced a significant increase in deferred tax assets, particularly in the areas of deferred compensation, accrued expenses, and net operating loss and other carryforwards. Specifically, deferred compensation increased from $19,344 thousand to $20,310 thousand, accrued expenses from $23,434 thousand to $26,811 thousand, and net operating loss and other carryforwards from $540,443 thousand to $531,257 thousand. Additionally, the company's investment in unconsolidated affiliates and other noncurrent assets also contributed to the increase in deferred tax assets.\n\nThese changes in deferred tax assets could impact the company's future financial position in several ways. Firstly, the increase in deferred tax assets could lead to higher future tax liabilities if the company's taxable income exceeds the carryforward amounts. Secondly, the valuation allowances on deferred tax assets decreased from $684,786 thousand in 2022 to $663,784 thousand in 2023, indicating a more optimistic outlook on the realization of these assets. This could reduce the company's effective tax rate in future periods, potentially improving its profitability.

Specifically, the company spent $25,474,000 on acquisitions of real estate and $17,055,000 on additions to real estate. Additionally, there was a significant outflow of $13,633,000 for escrowed loan repayment on behalf of a real estate partnership. These factors collectively resulted in a net cash used in investing activities of $36,315,000.\n\nComparatively, in 2022, the net cash used in investing activities was $6,714,000, primarily due to acquisitions of real estate and ground leases. In 2021, the net cash used in investing activities was $91,230,000, which was significantly higher than in 2022 and 2023. This higher figure in 2021 was largely due to the sale of properties, which generated $33,723,000 in proceeds, and the repayment of notes payable, which amounted to $3,468,000. The acquisitions of real estate and ground leases in 2021 also contributed to the higher investment activity compared to the subsequent years.","source":"data/test/NYSE_WSR_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[40,79,84,34,80,85,59,102,69,100,38,52,51,83,90,36,117,77,86,101,45,10,53,70,74,78,82,87,107,55,68,89,47,48,49,88,37,66,20,44,50,73,75,98,105,116,43,106,60,81,72,91,99,111,41,96,29,46,110,30,93,21,16,54,92,61,76,15,95,9,28,33,5,35,97,19,39,109,2,42,58,94,112,24,113,7,56,71,8,103,62,65,114,104,32,12,108,115,4,22,31,25,26,64,14,11,27,57,119,3,18,17,118,1,23,63,67,6,13,120],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This reclassification would have several adverse tax consequences. Firstly, the Operating Partnership would be taxed as a corporation rather than a partnership, which would significantly reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders. This is because corporations are subject to higher tax rates compared to partnerships.\n\nAdditionally, the reclassification would alter the character of the company's assets and items of gross income, potentially making it difficult to maintain the REIT status. REITs are structured to avoid corporate taxation by distributing most of their income to shareholders, thereby qualifying for favorable tax treatment. A reclassification would likely result in the company having to pay corporate taxes on its income, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distributions.\n\nFurthermore, the company would need to borrow funds or make taxable distributions to shareholders to meet the REIT distribution requirement and avoid the 4% excise tax. This could further strain the company's financial resources and impact its ability to grow and maintain its current distribution levels.

This shift could be attributed to the acquisition of First American, which has operations in Canada.\n\nOverall, the acquisition of First American has significantly impacted Deluxe's revenue streams, shifting focus from traditional check printing to payments technology and services.  The slight increase in revenue from the Checks segment may be attributed to the integration of First American's payments capabilities.\n","source":"data/test/NYSE_DLX_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[66,85,50,65,86,61,63,71,73,88,68,70,72,53,80,60,46,57,55,79,84,87,25,49,74,83,67,32,59,43,58,78,69,47,81,75,64,48,54,62,45,76,77,82,11,51,52,6,5,3,1,28,34,12,22,56,91,92,27,10,15,94,16,35,38,29,30,95,24,33,13,36,93,39,26,89,40,44,7,19,8,14,2,21,37,9,23,31,17,90,20,18,96,41,42,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"How does Hillenbrand's approach to establishing reserves for different types of claims, such as those covered by insurance versus other claims, differ, and what factors contribute to this difference in methodology?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[118],"raw_output":"","pred":"Hillenbrand establishes reserves for claims differently based on whether they are covered by insurance or not. For claims covered by insurance, reserves are established when payment is probable and are based on advice from internal and external counsel and historical settlement information. This approach leverages the insurer's expertise and historical data to estimate potential losses. In contrast, for other types of claims, reserves are established when payment is considered probable and are based on advice from internal and external counsel and historical settlement information. This method relies more heavily on the company's own assessment and historical data, as insurance coverage is not available.\n\nThe difference in methodology stems from the availability and reliability of insurance coverage. Claims covered by insurance have deductibles and self-funded retentions, which means the company has a financial buffer and can rely on external experts to manage the claims. For other claims, the company must rely solely on its own resources and expertise, leading to a more conservative approach in establishing reserves. This difference ensures that the company is adequately prepared for potential losses, whether they are covered by insurance or not.","source":"data/test/NYSE_HI_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[118,81,117,32,45,61,98,25,17,101,128,129,51,52,106,121,95,97,53,103,12,46,62,13,68,75,77,112,127,122,125,8,82,11,23,93,26,91,33,44,76,134,2,66,1,20,21,4,72,87,22,73,131,74,99,135,89,126,5,15,48,9,100,114,65,132,79,43,10,80,70,85,42,58,19,34,14,49,36,47,50,119,40,41,104,96,105,83,84,110,54,102,107,57,124,31,37,39,60,35,56,27,30,38,92,111,71,63,90,109,113,59,123,6,55,86,78,88,115,24,94,116,69,29,28,16,67,120,7,108,3,64,18,133,130],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This approach ensures that executives are not only focused on short-term financial performance but also on long-term sustainability and ethical practices.\n\nOverall, these measures contribute to the company's sustainability strategy by fostering a culture of accountability and alignment between executive compensation and the company's strategic goals, including environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and governance practices.","source":"data/test/NYSE_EHC_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,29,52,10,30,11,12,47,177,9,31,93,208,210,218,7,36,61,169,5,88,187,155,174,219,190,196,216,1,72,80,92,109,186,194,81,141,188,192,221,8,172,189,197,222,184,201,28,87,139,217,62,191,203,214,2,120,209,211,173,193,207,176,178,199,200,17,34,78,82,185,213,16,175,183,198,215,48,180,182,202,212,148,179,19,195,204,13,166,59,205,27,3,206,53,75,98,181,84,49,56,94,97,51,50,54,77,99,118,133,33,66,142,58,96,23,60,70,38,76,95,164,154,146,150,152,42,144,32,46,115,135,151,35,22,67,116,136,89,100,117,140,18,123,25,71,104,57,63,132,24,73,111,101,157,55,153,161,40,83,128,4,43,90,121,127,143,149,159,162,39,74,103,114,125,138,160,37,110,107,129,41,156,45,21,44,102,106,130,20,68,108,119,122,64,126,14,171,105,113,134,170,65,145,69,85,86,91,131,220,79,124,147,112,167,165,163,168,26,137,15,158],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This implies that the $128.1 million represents the total goodwill balance after accounting for all acquisitions and goodwill-related transactions in 2023 and 2024.\n\nTherefore, the expected total goodwill balance at the end of 2024, assuming no impairments or other changes, would be $128.1 million.","source":"data/test/NYSE_EHC_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[200,193,190,192,109,189,6,216,177,191,194,78,212,208,203,210,151,215,3,92,155,173,184,197,150,204,209,211,201,205,120,141,196,180,187,198,217,62,47,72,175,195,206,9,154,169,179,207,213,87,96,172,178,182,218,81,84,181,188,202,214,5,7,8,12,174,16,27,95,139,160,185,136,170,183,186,11,30,142,176,199,222,83,88,113,144,148,219,1,19,29,52,66,80,82,103,115,146,54,61,89,149,75,93,156,57,118,166,2,10,60,68,76,221,48,74,114,132,157,161,128,140,152,59,70,99,130,133,153,17,28,43,44,94,129,58,36,63,71,143,159,31,34,53,90,107,127,105,125,162,67,117,33,56,116,145,77,101,14,49,65,110,100,98,123,158,147,85,86,4,121,138,24,26,45,119,22,50,126,64,108,38,102,106,220,39,111,164,20,42,51,69,73,13,18,46,79,171,131,32,122,55,37,137,35,124,91,25,23,104,112,97,15,21,135,168,40,167,41,163,134,165],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The increase in the accumulated deficit and the conversion of preferred stock into common stock indicate a significant reduction in the company's equity, reflecting a challenging financial position.","source":"data/test/NYSE_LLAP_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[66,65,68,81,48,99,88,92,71,85,90,94,98,91,100,84,93,39,67,83,44,47,80,96,55,60,77,64,95,73,79,82,86,40,53,87,97,104,17,43,72,89,46,69,101,102,30,37,41,59,70,52,76,4,58,75,103,78,105,29,45,16,24,111,112,42,7,21,23,1,50,18,113,110,123,124,36,49,108,125,109,107,122,25,33,8,114,116,34,10,121,22,106,20,32,38,74,14,5,120,126,6,28,31,2,62,119,27,15,35,51,3,19,12,9,11,13,118,26,63,117,130,54,131,128,115,129,127,61,56,57],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin, which fell from 41.4% in fiscal year 2022 to 35.7% in fiscal year 2023. The gross profit margin decrease was due to higher store occupancy costs, store depreciation expense, and merchandising payroll costs, which were partially offset by improved pricing strategies and a decrease in e-Commerce shipping costs.\n\nAdditionally, the company experienced a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, which fell from $439.4 million in fiscal year 2022 to $297.9 million in fiscal year 2023. This reduction was attributed to lower store and e-Commerce payroll costs, share-based compensation expenses, and other store operating costs. However, the company also incurred higher interest expenses, which increased from $29.5 million in fiscal year 2022 to $39.2 million in fiscal year 2023, primarily due to an increase in the variable interest rate associated with the 1st Amendment to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement.\n\nOverall, the increase in net sales and the reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses contributed positively to the net income, which rose from a loss of $29.9 million in fiscal year 2022 to a profit of $50.2 million in fiscal year 2023. Despite the increase in interest expenses, the company managed to achieve a significant improvement in its financial performance.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[51,49,48,43,47,50,90,44,72,26,70,54,82,97,69,2,52,77,88,91,66,86,80,73,81,55,53,75,78,65,13,95,29,67,74,14,92,96,8,34,84,68,93,32,94,98,41,46,56,60,76,39,79,33,62,89,71,6,9,99,18,19,21,87,31,64,12,45,61,30,25,83,85,3,23,35,58,22,59,16,5,27,37,100,110,38,57,40,42,1,28,104,7,36,101,107,20,15,24,106,103,11,4,108,109,102,105,10,17,63],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

However, from September 2020 onwards, Sunnova's performance diverges significantly. While the NYSE Composite and the Invesco Solar ETF experience a decline, Sunnova's stock price continues to rise, peaking in December 2020.

Sunnova's initial outperformance could be attributed to market optimism and investor interest in the company's solar energy services. However, the subsequent decline might be influenced by factors such as increased competition, regulatory changes, or economic downturns affecting the solar energy sector. The NYSE Composite and the Invesco Solar ETF's decline could be due to broader market volatility and sector-specific challenges, such as shifts in renewable energy policies or technological advancements.

In 2022, net interest income was $540.6 million, while in 2023 it dropped to $497.0 million, a decrease of $43.6 million. This reduction was due to a decline in interest income from $597.4 million in 2022 to $810.4 million in 2023, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from $56.8 million to $313.4 million.\n\nThe decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest and fees on loans and leases, which fell from $439.8 million to $590.6 million, and a reduction in income on investment securities from $70.6 million to $93.5 million. Additionally, the provision for credit losses increased from $7.8 million to $9.0 million, further impacting net income.\n\nDespite these challenges, the bank managed to maintain its net income by reducing noninterest expenses.

This consistency in dividend payments did not significantly impact the shareholders' equity.\n\n3. **Net Interest Margin**: The net interest margin decreased from 2.50% in 2022 to 2.24% in 2023, which could have affected the overall profitability and thus the shareholders' equity.\n\n4. **Efficiency Ratio**: The efficiency ratio increased from 59.49% in 2022 to 64.95% in 2023, indicating higher non-interest expenses relative to total revenue.

Therefore, the fair value of the investments is higher than their amortized cost, reflecting the current market conditions and the company's intention to hold these investments for the near term.","source":"data/test/NYSE_SEMR_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[85,90,80,91,84,75,89,78,110,108,79,107,81,76,67,92,112,77,86,88,69,100,96,82,95,97,65,66,109,106,56,94,63,70,62,102,1,9,113,8,87,99,54,98,17,72,60,61,105,111,103,55,73,49,83,58,93,10,27,41,53,59,12,13,51,71,74,122,52,50,101,57,64,7,6,131,104,37,135,47,116,36,42,45,40,68,38,15,3,4,127,28,34,11,35,46,26,115,44,5,39,23,117,133,138,22,32,33,129,29,31,120,130,20,132,134,136,2,18,21,43,19,24,14,16,25,30,123,125,118,119,139,124,48,126,121,128,114,137],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

It also includes interest expense, total income tax provision, and (income) expense related to contingent consideration and other items.\n\nIn contrast, for reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, the company includes net cash provided by operating activities, net change in operating assets and liabilities, interest expense, current income tax provision, and other non-cash and non-recurring expense (income). It excludes the non-cash items mentioned above, focusing instead on the cash flows generated from operating activities.\n\nThis difference highlights the focus on cash flows in the operating activities reconciliation, emphasizing the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations, while the net income reconciliation includes both cash and non-cash items, providing a broader view of profitability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MTDR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[126,212,213,120,123,127,163,211,124,171,178,179,90,214,149,166,172,34,118,72,82,176,130,180,145,170,28,140,161,188,202,16,156,167,196,204,60,114,146,174,192,198,2,116,128,147,164,190,200,18,108,160,112,162,20,22,206,66,131,4,19,148,26,32,136,182,36,109,142,144,184,40,177,201,113,138,30,155,96,165,46,24,119,194,17,84,168,210,74,158,64,68,110,197,70,117,38,111,185,85,125,209,122,217,11,15,205,5,27,50,115,135,181,8,78,102,121,129,87,183,14,137,199,37,41,54,98,62,88,35,133,58,104,186,3,29,169,173,191,195,134,157,189,25,65,175,21,31,71,86,132,154,193,203,7,48,52,56,76,187,218,23,44,57,208,33,94,152,42,80,39,69,99,77,100,55,67,207,12,13,1,47,59,91,93,97,9,73,139,63,92,81,150,43,151,159,53,6,105,106,143,79,107,75,83,101,51,216,49,89,153,45,95,103,10,141,61,215],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This scenario would likely result in higher revenues for Matador, potentially offsetting the increased costs of drilling and completing wells.\n\nHowever, the company's overall financial strategy would need to adapt.  While higher prices provide a short-term boost, the geopolitical disruption could lead to instability and uncertainty in the market.  Matador may need to focus on hedging strategies to mitigate price volatility and ensure consistent cash flow.  They might also prioritize diversifying their production sources to reduce reliance on any single region or country.

Capital raising is often necessary to fund dividend payments. The company notes that it may need to raise capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet commitments and business needs, which could include financing acquisitions.\n\n2. Dividend payments are a key use of capital. The company relies on dividends from its subsidiary bank for substantially all of its income and as the primary source of funds for dividends to preferred, common, and NVCE stockholders.\n\n3. Regulatory constraints can limit both activities. The company faces significant capital and other regulatory requirements, which could increase from current levels and require additional capital. Failure to meet these requirements could restrict activities and impact profitability.\n\n4. The FRB may require capital injections or other support for troubled subsidiaries, potentially limiting the company's ability to raise capital elsewhere.\n\nThe potential consequences of regulatory constraints on both activities include:\n\n1. Reduced profitability and financial stability if capital raising is limited and dividend payments are restricted.\n\n2. Increased financial risk if the company cannot meet regulatory requirements or respond to regulatory demands.\n\n3. Adverse impacts on customer and investor confidence if the company's ability to pay dividends is compromised.\n\n4.

This growth suggests the company is expanding its market share and product offerings effectively.\n\n2. Gross profit margin decline: While revenue has grown, the gross profit margin has declined from 65.6% in 2021 to 62.6% in 2023. This could indicate increased costs or pricing pressures, which may require the company to focus on cost control and efficiency improvements.\n\n3. Operating expenses growth: Operating expenses have increased from $385 million in 2021 to $450 million in 2023, outpacing revenue growth. This suggests the company may need to optimize its operational efficiency and consider cost-saving measures.\n\n4. Net income growth: Net income has grown from $125 million in 2021 to $150 million in 2023, indicating overall profitability. However, the company may need to balance revenue growth with cost management to maintain this trend.\n\n5.

The company may consider investing in strategic initiatives to further enhance its market position.\n\n6. Shareholder return: The company has paid dividends and repurchased shares, indicating a commitment to shareholder value.

Companion animal revenue constitutes a larger portion of total revenue in markets like Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom, ranging from 50% to 77%. This indicates a higher emphasis on pet care and animal health in these regions, possibly due to higher disposable incomes, greater pet ownership, and a stronger pet care culture.\n\nIn contrast, livestock revenue is more prominent in markets like Chile, China, and the United States, with percentages ranging from 23% to 48%. This suggests a greater focus on agricultural and livestock health in these regions, which may be driven by factors such as a larger agricultural sector, higher demand for animal products, and a need for robust livestock health management to ensure food safety and production efficiency.\n\nThe varying revenue distribution also reflects economic differences. Wealthier regions with higher disposable incomes tend to allocate more resources to companion animal care, while more economically developed regions with larger agricultural sectors prioritize livestock health. Additionally, cultural and societal factors, such as the prevalence of pet ownership and the importance of livestock in local economies, play significant roles in shaping these revenue distributions.","source":"data/test/NYSE_ZTS_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[10,41,9,76,11,3,75,2,77,42,49,40,70,25,50,14,43,13,6,47,26,5,59,4,78,80,16,19,12,29,32,53,17,15,21,24,56,88,97,18,27,60,31,35,44,46,20,63,79,98,30,89,91,33,36,48,55,72,111,8,81,65,67,83,71,22,38,82,54,45,37,95,85,90,57,93,52,68,84,86,66,1,112,39,104,51,69,28,73,106,61,96,23,62,100,92,107,7,34,64,101,74,58,87,94,105,103,102,108,109,110,99],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The company might have shifted its focus to fixed income securities to ensure liquidity and stability, especially given the international nature of the plans, which may face different economic challenges compared to domestic plans.\n\nOverall, these changes reflect the company's dynamic approach to managing its pension plans, adjusting to market conditions and strategic objectives to ensure the long-term stability and growth of the pension funds.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AYI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[67,68,70,66,76,74,16,41,51,58,60,75,56,42,71,8,50,12,47,21,69,46,13,24,25,48,57,53,29,43,49,132,178,59,17,35,45,220,23,77,79,4,54,200,65,14,19,37,22,30,32,40,78,143,216,26,100,112,44,84,128,168,174,235,6,122,5,33,62,73,189,236,27,129,215,31,36,72,113,127,148,159,239,34,52,64,80,147,175,217,38,81,192,213,196,238,130,153,176,15,173,210,92,97,99,109,125,155,171,63,85,144,145,172,179,201,218,28,83,133,150,240,247,2,61,111,126,141,157,252,256,9,55,86,91,188,193,197,208,214,221,222,223,251,18,93,103,135,154,232,244,254,82,101,107,164,167,177,181,227,231,253,1,10,20,108,131,190,233,118,121,124,219,242,250,257,102,134,170,185,229,258,104,120,139,158,180,202,204,207,248,259,89,114,123,156,160,166,199,249,98,106,212,187,206,243,255,110,116,119,162,191,7,11,39,90,138,151,169,198,246,184,228,94,96,146,163,241,117,205,209,211,165,186,203,3,115,226,161,237,137,136,142,183,140,182,194,224,225,95,230,234,105,149,195,261,245,152,260,88,87],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

{"question":"What are the potential financial implications for an investor holding American Depositary Shares (ADSs) in terms of fees and currency conversion, and how might these affect the overall value of their investment?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[127],"raw_output":"","pred":"Holding American Depositary Shares (ADSs) involves several potential financial implications for investors. Firstly, there are fees associated with the ADSs, including a $0.00015 per ADS annual fee and a $0.00015 per ADS quarterly fee. These fees can accumulate over time and reduce the overall value of the investment.\n\nSecondly, currency conversion is a significant factor. The ADSs are denominated in U.S. dollars, but the underlying company's revenues and expenses are primarily in Renminbi (RMB). This means that the value of the ADSs is affected by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB. Fluctuations in this exchange rate can either increase or decrease the value of the ADSs, depending on whether the RMB appreciates or depreciates against the U.S. dollar.\n\nFor example, if the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of the ADSs in U.S. dollars will increase, potentially leading to higher returns for the investor. Conversely, if the RMB depreciates, the value of the ADSs in U.S. dollars will decrease, potentially resulting in lower returns.\n\nAdditionally, the ADSs are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10% on dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises, unless exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between China and other countries. This tax can further reduce the net return on the investment.\n\nOverall, these factors can significantly impact the value of an investor's ADSs, requiring careful consideration of currency fluctuations and tax implications.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,55,52,126,51,119,127,175,9,10,4,177,33,123,174,169,15,124,122,159,162,203,28,200,27,47,38,8,50,54,125,56,57,118,163,44,204,170,11,17,142,164,168,176,167,189,196,35,121,130,165,197,145,161,115,120,179,207,173,158,37,148,202,157,178,160,166,172,149,150,151,186,22,191,16,93,147,188,199,12,180,194,152,192,39,190,206,154,182,156,181,187,205,21,36,88,184,18,25,32,193,195,201,40,153,171,42,198,41,1,63,34,46,146,155,183,31,104,29,106,20,24,114,62,143,26,49,105,19,67,81,185,45,91,30,92,267,102,103,248,58,76,258,2,131,23,86,97,5,87,111,66,109,80,82,84,98,117,53,70,85,101,257,61,59,64,133,256,65,100,129,268,220,230,241,3,128,221,247,95,289,290,68,75,78,99,132,269,94,210,250,282,209,271,281,43,60,110,211,240,249,278,288,71,108,219,265,279,83,141,229,291,116,266,69,89,90,112,264,138,259,285,232,212,218,270,74,293,238,231,77,96,107,251,7,134,135,216,233,79,213,260,73,239,286,223,292,136,208,237,246,255,13,113,252,284,14,217,222,243,6,72,228,234,273,283,272,242,287,137,263,262,277,144,245,275,280,214,139,294,236,224,253,215,235,140,227,261,226,254,276,244,274,225],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3}]}

This unique design presents several engineering challenges in managing water flow and pressure:\n\n1. Water flow control: The curved shape may require specialized spillway designs to efficiently channel water over the dam without causing erosion or instability. The concave surface could potentially concentrate water flow in certain areas, necessitating careful engineering to distribute the force evenly.\n\n2. Pressure management: The curved geometry could lead to uneven distribution of water pressure across the dam's surface. Engineers would need to design the structure to withstand these varying pressures without cracking or failing. Special attention would be required to the dam's foundation and base to ensure it can support the water weight and pressure.\n\n3. Structural integrity: The concave shape may require additional reinforcement or unique construction techniques to maintain stability. The curvature could create stress points that need to be carefully analyzed and addressed.\n\n4. Maintenance and inspection: The unique shape may make regular inspection and maintenance more challenging. Specialized equipment or access methods may be needed to ensure the dam remains in good condition over time.\n\n5. Environmental impact: The design may affect downstream ecosystems and water flow patterns, requiring careful consideration of ecological impacts during construction and operation.\n\nOverall, the curved shape of this dam presents a complex engineering challenge that requires specialized knowledge and innovative solutions to ensure safe and effective water management.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NWE_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,1,5,3,54,8,7,43,24,41,2,40,45,9,23,129,86,4,10,127,138,38,21,11,37,55,74,39,46,44,88,33,42,14,18,53,104,105,68,27,51,99,22,56,128,28,125,32,76,101,25,70,26,36,57,110,12,17,29,75,87,108,102,118,16,71,85,94,103,30,47,20,107,120,123,61,73,84,13,31,67,78,111,79,119,34,49,81,96,63,113,60,97,100,72,95,109,115,83,48,65,69,98,112,124,126,15,64,121,130,137,52,82,92,77,19,35,66,80,50,117,122,62,114,131,116,133,136,58,59,106,89,135,91,132,134,93,90],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

However, these negative factors were partially offset by foreign deferred tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nDespite the decrease in Shareholders' net income, Adjusted income from operations increased in 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher earnings in the Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth Health Services segments. The growth in these segments was driven by factors such as higher premiums, medical costs, and pharmacy revenues. Specifically, pharmacy revenues increased by 7%, reflecting inflation on branded drugs and growth in specialty. Premiums also increased by 11%, driven by insured customer growth and higher premium rates. These positive developments in key operational metrics, such as medical costs and other benefit expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, contributed to the overall increase in Adjusted income from operations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CI_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[84,82,83,81,142,5,112,13,199,99,85,165,184,113,93,23,88,105,73,44,164,97,95,146,147,163,120,67,6,90,182,66,61,63,102,138,159,92,158,160,8,96,72,148,69,103,98,101,38,89,109,45,65,100,125,130,139,94,106,119,33,43,77,107,32,126,86,136,143,149,50,62,64,79,30,111,186,70,124,131,137,166,37,104,152,153,52,71,144,122,49,55,80,129,145,177,127,174,68,87,108,114,132,134,135,183,42,74,157,171,46,161,162,117,154,11,27,187,31,47,48,60,133,176,35,185,75,155,7,15,41,51,57,110,36,169,12,21,53,58,116,118,115,141,150,26,91,56,140,151,18,173,4,14,128,167,172,34,17,10,24,123,175,28,168,59,76,121,22,156,40,54,39,78,178,181,192,193,20,2,29,9,180,196,197,198,200,16,1,19,188,179,25,189,191,194,170,195,3,190],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What are the key differences between the chloride and sulfate processes for TiO2 production, and how do these differences impact their suitability for various end-use applications?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[8],"raw_output":"","pred":"The chloride and sulfate processes for TiO2 production differ significantly in their raw materials, extraction methods, and end-use applications. The chloride process uses chlorine to extract rutile TiO2 from slag or rutile ore, producing less waste and requiring less energy and labor compared to the sulfate process. This process is preferred for coatings and plastics due to its blueish undertone and higher production capacity. The sulfate process, on the other hand, uses sulfuric acid to extract TiO2 from ilmenite ore, producing a warmer undertone. This process is favored for paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, which often generate higher profit margins. The sulfate process also involves more finishing treatments to upgrade the intermediate pigment. These differences in production methods and end-use applications highlight the chloride process's efficiency and the sulfate process's versatility and higher profit margins.","source":"data/test/NYSE_KRO_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[8,9,24,11,12,17,6,10,7,13,19,66,86,14,91,38,26,59,89,28,67,32,93,92,84,29,5,27,36,4,62,69,54,63,82,45,25,30,60,56,18,81,65,61,31,64,40,21,46,57,20,22,44,34,35,70,88,71,3,39,2,50,55,75,77,37,85,52,41,90,74,15,79,87,23,33,68,76,48,58,80,42,78,51,83,47,53,72,16,73,49,1,94,43],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Each operating location is subject to local laws and regulations that dictate what injuries are required to be recorded and reported, which can vary from location to location. This variability in reporting standards can lead to inconsistencies in the data collected, making it challenging to compare safety performance across different regions.\n\nFor internal global tracking, benchmarking, and identification of opportunities for improvement, Kronos uses a U.S.-based injury rate calculation to arrive at a global total frequency rate. However, this approach may not be directly comparable to the recordable incident rates calculated under U.S. law. The differences in reporting requirements can result in underreporting or overreporting of injuries, depending on the location's standards. This can lead to an inaccurate assessment of the company's overall safety performance.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, Kronos must ensure that data from all locations is standardized and comparable. This could involve harmonizing reporting requirements, implementing a consistent data collection and analysis framework, and ensuring that all locations adhere to a uniform set of safety metrics. By doing so, Kronos can more accurately assess its global safety performance and identify areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing overall safety and compliance across its operations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_KRO_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[16,13,89,91,51,3,23,5,17,61,6,14,46,12,60,93,50,56,20,71,1,92,45,2,4,21,44,11,58,32,55,57,59,15,35,88,19,54,94,24,31,48,70,30,40,7,41,90,18,64,87,22,26,52,25,38,81,27,86,29,62,28,68,42,53,37,8,34,65,36,85,9,77,83,43,66,39,84,69,78,82,74,63,49,33,47,73,10,76,80,75,79,67,72],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

In contrast, both the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Retailing Index showed much more modest gains during this period. The S&P 500 increased from around 250 to about 350, while the S&P 500 Retailing Index rose from around 200 to about 300.\n\nThis stark contrast suggests that CVNA faced significant challenges or negative developments during this time frame that heavily impacted its stock price, while the broader market and retail sector performed relatively well. The company's stock price continued to decline in 2022, reaching a low of around 100, while the indices remained relatively stable.\n\nThis trend implies that CVNA's performance lagged behind the broader market and retail sector during this period, potentially due to company-specific issues or challenges that were not shared by the broader economy or retail industry.

In comparison, the S&P MidCap 400 Index shows a more stable and slightly increasing trend, starting at $100 and ending at $162.73. The peer group also shows a generally increasing trend, starting at $100 and ending at $141.58.\n\nThe differences in performance trends can be attributed to several factors. American Eagle Outfitters faced challenges such as supply chain disruptions, inflation, and increased costs, which impacted its financial performance. The company also had to navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected consumer behavior and retail operations. Additionally, the company's decision to close stores and focus on digital channels during the pandemic may have had short-term negative effects on its revenue.\n\nIn contrast, the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the peer group benefited from broader market trends and economic recovery, which supported their overall growth. The S&P MidCap 400 Index, representing a broader market segment, likely had more diversified exposure to various economic factors, providing a more stable performance. The peer group, being a closely aligned group of companies, likely faced similar market conditions, contributing to their collective growth.\n\nOverall, American Eagle Outfitters' performance was more volatile and negatively impacted by specific challenges, while the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the peer group benefited from broader market trends and economic recovery.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AEO_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[29,90,55,35,31,81,48,4,7,41,3,67,32,53,40,77,1,87,78,34,85,51,54,62,101,104,5,37,96,98,109,86,102,76,113,114,2,43,50,12,6,91,93,115,116,9,11,8,52,103,33,57,59,110,97,63,89,36,92,10,112,64,107,111,71,14,73,106,38,69,75,58,24,45,61,70,44,119,42,68,13,22,28,46,27,15,56,79,16,21,80,60,39,65,118,17,26,84,83,74,20,72,117,95,105,94,30,66,25,49,23,19,99,100,18,47,88,108,82],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Specifically, the net deferred tax asset of Operating lease ROU assets decreased by $52,234 thousand, while the net deferred tax liability of Operating lease liabilities increased by $33,832 thousand. Similarly, the net deferred tax liability of Property and equipment increased by $31,928 thousand, and the net deferred tax liability of disallowed business interest expense increased by $8,353 thousand.\n\nThese changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities could impact the company's future tax liabilities in several ways. The decrease in net deferred tax assets, particularly in the areas of Operating lease ROU assets and Property and equipment, suggests that the company may have reduced its future tax benefits from these assets.

The development must not have used any equipment, supplies, facility, or Confidential Information of the employer.\n2. The development must relate directly to the employer's business or the employer's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development.\n3. The development must result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.\n\nThese criteria are designed to ensure that any inventions or discoveries made by the employee are considered \"Excluded Developments\" and thus belong to the employer. The first criterion ensures that the employee's work was done independently, without relying on employer resources. The second criterion ensures that the development is relevant to the employer's core business or future plans. The third criterion confirms that the development was a direct result of the employee's work for the employer.\n\nTogether, these criteria help to clarify ownership of intellectual property by distinguishing between developments that are the employee's own creations and those that are the employer's property due to the employee's work on the employer's behalf. This distinction is crucial for maintaining the employer's intellectual property rights and ensuring that the employee's contributions are appropriately recognized and protected.","source":"data/test/NYSE_ZYME_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[195,210,209,194,198,156,261,197,168,166,170,80,213,212,22,224,184,293,196,214,162,178,199,167,314,202,139,260,328,48,203,303,5,183,86,287,127,206,217,299,64,87,179,207,204,208,291,31,73,94,205,216,249,269,135,165,181,234,243,296,30,132,159,247,18,21,54,128,134,200,201,221,225,235,288,95,185,192,211,270,302,310,262,273,97,169,282,294,326,161,189,308,177,193,227,237,301,325,111,131,215,285,66,84,103,115,126,155,163,236,257,20,35,83,85,99,158,182,222,233,240,274,317,9,45,190,223,305,318,320,322,153,271,327,26,29,141,175,191,226,263,3,7,121,122,125,259,60,100,108,129,136,146,154,23,138,160,172,267,306,321,19,39,79,164,171,272,56,101,109,113,174,244,252,278,90,117,120,150,292,309,329,47,65,88,89,107,151,218,248,78,105,112,116,118,157,239,246,6,74,265,43,71,106,137,152,290,300,324,8,55,91,140,219,251,280,286,311,312,27,32,44,81,102,119,238,323,1,93,144,266,275,283,295,298,33,49,75,180,228,230,16,58,96,114,124,147,148,176,220,250,304,313,50,62,67,98,173,276,319,68,70,92,133,264,37,53,110,142,188,229,279,316,10,232,241,28,57,59,245,15,38,76,77,268,46,242,4,145,69,143,14,231,63,41,284,25,104,130,254,51,72,61,11,186,307,82,297,13,24,277,149,315,34,17,258,255,187,253,289,52,281,40,36,2,42,12,123,256],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Historically, the blocks have faced similar issues, including force majeure events and the issuance of Municipal Agreement No. 007 of Puerto Guzmán, which prohibited exploration and production activities. These events have led to the termination of the E&P contract and the need for the company to pay a royalty to the ANH based on hydrocarbons produced in the blocks.\n\nThe implications for the completion of these commitments are substantial. The company has already submitted requests for termination of the E&P contracts and is awaiting ANH approval. If the termination is granted, the company may face legal and financial consequences, including the need to pay additional fees and royalties. Additionally, the company may have to restructure its operations and potentially divest its interests in these blocks, which could impact its overall exploration and production strategy in the region.

This indicates an increase of $8,145,000 in financial liabilities at amortized cost from 2022 to 2023.\n\nThe increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost suggests that the company has taken on more debt or has increased its existing debt obligations. This could be due to various reasons such as expanding operations, investing in new projects, or refinancing existing debt. The higher debt levels may imply a more aggressive financial strategy, aiming to capitalize on growth opportunities or to secure long-term financing at potentially favorable terms.\n\nHowever, the increase in financial liabilities also raises concerns about the company's financial health and risk management. Higher debt levels can lead to increased interest expenses, which may strain the company's cash flow and profitability. Additionally, if the company is unable to manage these liabilities effectively, it could face financial difficulties, including potential default risks.\n\nOverall, while the increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost may indicate a proactive approach to growth and financing, it also highlights the importance of careful financial management and risk assessment to ensure long-term sustainability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_GPRK_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[204,205,186,107,180,196,206,218,183,24,176,210,108,170,23,27,116,198,106,127,45,207,222,184,171,174,147,173,12,41,103,119,163,192,35,113,115,181,185,55,154,165,11,21,31,168,169,188,189,224,20,152,211,231,61,79,118,178,209,220,246,22,104,117,120,160,230,36,39,135,137,145,175,179,191,197,225,18,51,121,208,105,153,161,40,88,95,109,26,111,214,66,199,249,167,172,60,64,151,223,114,125,193,38,70,134,80,158,213,46,62,219,67,177,200,212,227,32,71,17,57,142,187,93,126,228,232,29,63,162,164,166,195,42,77,241,34,56,73,112,226,25,30,54,194,242,33,37,69,102,130,143,190,215,229,50,53,248,59,97,250,49,76,91,131,182,90,129,221,16,81,122,146,217,44,78,240,253,10,68,3,13,19,43,48,157,251,15,75,58,110,4,14,86,233,247,150,236,243,89,92,99,149,239,252,28,96,98,201,203,257,259,133,244,74,132,65,87,128,83,216,100,139,141,235,256,138,85,5,72,84,124,156,144,148,245,255,101,1,2,8,136,237,52,155,254,47,258,140,123,234,238,202,82,159,260,9,6,94,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The primary focus of this department is medical research and development, particularly in areas related to military medicine and healthcare for service members.\n\nThe licensing agreement described in the document appears to be related to transferring medical technology or intellectual property from the USAMRDC to a private company, Adaptive Phage Therapeutics. This suggests that the USAMRDC is likely involved in developing or owning medical technologies, possibly in the field of phage therapy for treating bacterial infections.\n\nThe agreement allows Adaptive Phage Therapeutics to use and commercialize certain technologies or products developed by the USAMRDC, while also granting the USAMRDC rights to use the licensed materials for non-commercial purposes. This type of arrangement is common in technology transfer agreements, where government agencies aim to leverage their research for public benefit while also potentially generating revenue.\n\nThe relationship between the USAMRDC and Adaptive Phage Therapeutics in this licensing agreement likely involves the transfer of medical technologies or intellectual property related to phage therapy, which could be used to develop new treatments for bacterial infections. This partnership allows the USAMRDC to support medical research while also potentially benefiting from commercialization of its innovations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_PHGE_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[175,174,177,178,187,186,163,180,198,172,166,189,7,225,231,34,244,182,223,238,164,168,181,247,35,170,33,80,157,185,188,190,230,63,131,207,219,154,212,215,158,167,191,199,214,237,239,242,246,156,159,173,217,224,240,250,60,64,169,171,213,265,4,136,151,153,184,192,232,233,245,266,276,65,152,161,208,218,229,243,252,260,272,56,69,71,77,160,165,216,226,282,54,92,132,183,195,203,205,210,236,279,62,109,134,155,197,200,211,249,267,112,204,209,251,255,268,281,14,32,43,106,139,179,194,222,248,269,1,3,58,61,78,82,120,128,149,221,227,16,87,130,133,146,193,196,206,220,228,241,253,259,277,280,59,97,105,121,202,262,263,274,23,48,66,76,145,150,201,234,264,270,31,70,148,254,257,261,273,38,53,278,17,104,135,235,271,72,94,119,147,2,5,15,28,30,37,42,51,79,256,47,68,74,25,39,88,122,258,275,40,118,126,27,55,91,111,127,29,36,45,50,81,89,108,162,83,84,110,24,129,22,44,57,73,86,99,107,20,41,95,113,117,49,67,96,115,6,52,116,143,46,90,138,8,13,75,85,100,21,125,142,98,9,93,114,18,137,26,124,141,10,101,12,123,11,102,140,144,176,19,103],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Firstly, the firm's focus on value investing, particularly in large-cap stocks, has proven resilient during market downturns. This strategy emphasizes companies with compelling catalysts and market capitalizations greater than $3 billion, which are undervalued and offer potential for long-term growth. Additionally, the firm's commitment to active management and engaged ownership has been crucial. By investing in research and data science, Neuberger Berman enhances its ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities, even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nThe firm leverages its insights and engagement strategies through a disciplined investment philosophy that integrates three core tenets: normalized earnings as a long-term indicator of company health, industries with capacity constraints facing less competition, and the importance of potential catalysts to avoid value traps. This approach is supported by a team of experienced value investors and close collaboration with the Global Equity Research Department. Furthermore, Neuberger Berman's active engagement with company management and its commitment to transparency through the NB Votes program helps in identifying and addressing governance issues that can impact long-term financial performance. These strategies, combined with a long-term investment horizon, enable the firm to navigate market challenges and deliver strong results for its clients.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NHS_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[42,30,8,46,14,5,45,10,28,7,17,13,35,36,2,16,21,6,53,57,3,25,29,33,47,62,37,39,52,15,63,31,49,20,55,48,23,44,54,22,38,1,24,61,64,56,58,4,60,34,59,11,9,32,50,18,12,43,41,26,40,51,19,27],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Firstly, the net gains increased from a loss of $4,013,000 in 2022 to a loss of $250,000 in 2023. This improvement is primarily due to the sale of redundant properties and non-core assets, which resulted in gains in 2023, particularly in Western Europe.

This difference can be attributed to a few key factors:\n\n1. Negative comparable sales environment: The company experienced a decrease in comparable customer transactions (-2.9%) and comparable average ticket (-0.3%) compared to fiscal 2022.\n\n2. Impact of macroeconomic factors: The continued shift in consumer consumption trends away from goods and towards services, along with a higher interest rate environment, pressured home improvement demand.\n\n3. Lumber price deflation: The Lumber department posted a double-digit comparable sales decline (-11.4%) primarily due to lumber price deflation, partially offset by higher unit sales.\n\n4. Shift in product categories: While some departments like Building Materials, Outdoor Garden, Hardware, and Plumbing posted positive comparable sales, others saw declines.\n\n5. Online sales growth: Online sales increased 1.1% to 14.8% of net sales, but this was not enough to offset the decline in comparable sales.\n\n6. Currency impact: A weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by $276 million, which partially mitigated the overall decline.\n\nIn summary, while Home Depot's overall net sales decreased by 3.0%, its comparable sales decreased by 3.2%, driven by factors like macroeconomic shifts and lumber price deflation.","source":"data/test/NYSE_HD_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[36,2,35,6,8,37,34,39,12,40,47,43,3,27,16,46,13,56,10,50,9,17,33,28,38,18,41,42,52,77,11,49,67,72,74,7,15,48,73,20,57,59,69,83,99,64,68,25,55,21,66,88,4,63,26,45,65,22,53,58,14,54,61,51,23,32,71,75,1,5,19,80,90,30,60,79,89,98,44,76,85,70,84,91,24,29,78,81,93,31,62,92,87,94,82,96,97,95,86],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

In fiscal year 2023, the gross profit margin decreased to 48.7%, compared to 65.9% in fiscal year 2022. This decline was primarily due to increased costs of revenue, particularly in the cost of product, subscription, and support revenue, which rose by $5.2 million or 64%. This increase was attributed to higher cloud subscription costs, ramping up for a significant revenue customer in the second half of fiscal year 2023, duplicative charges during customer transitions from on-premises to cloud-based deployment formats, and the establishment of an inventory reserve.\n\nAdditionally, the gross profit margin for professional services revenue increased to 66% in fiscal year 2023, up from 47% in fiscal year 2022. This improvement was due to a decrease in headcount and the volume of professional services provided to customers.\n\nOverall, these factors contributed to a significant decrease in total gross profit, from $18,161,000 in fiscal year 2022 to $13,263,000 in fiscal year 2023.

This indicates that the cost associated with the services provided by the employees remained consistent over the period.\n\n2. **Interest Cost**: The interest cost increased from $0.3 million in 2022 to $0.5 million in 2023. This rise suggests that the interest rate used to determine the benefit obligation increased, leading to a higher cost.\n\n3. **Benefits Paid**: The benefits paid decreased from $0.2 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023. This reduction could be due to changes in the benefits structure or the number of beneficiaries.\n\n4. **Actuarial Gain**: The actuarial gain decreased from $2.0 million in 2022 to $0.7 million in 2023. This decline indicates that the gains recognized from the actuarial valuation decreased, possibly due to changes in the actuarial assumptions or the performance of the plan assets.\n\n5. **Currency Fluctuation Adjustment**: The currency fluctuation adjustment increased from a $0.8 million loss in 2022 to a $0.1 million gain in 2023. This improvement suggests that the currency movements were more favorable in 2023, reducing the negative impact on the benefit obligation.\n\nOverall, the increase in interest cost and the decrease in benefits paid and actuarial gain contributed to a reduction in the benefit obligation, while the service cost and currency fluctuation adjustment remained relatively stable.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMP_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,118,84,85,113,115,7,71,79,83,130,97,68,73,72,116,19,74,102,120,49,88,90,94,125,138,17,78,34,46,69,80,121,62,47,129,45,50,81,100,48,87,105,112,9,101,106,126,131,135,114,95,104,117,136,142,43,44,61,96,134,12,57,110,70,75,20,21,67,140,122,107,123,127,137,56,77,103,37,145,55,111,33,92,108,109,128,155,6,160,76,133,24,63,82,162,25,99,23,35,86,132,4,66,18,93,32,91,1,98,153,41,22,64,151,14,124,141,30,31,26,144,36,157,54,143,15,166,16,60,163,38,139,149,42,27,152,10,28,150,29,65,89,3,5,53,51,13,11,158,159,8,59,39,154,165,146,147,164,161,2,40,52,156,148,58],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What precautions should be taken when using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, and why are these precautions necessary?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[530],"raw_output":"","pred":"When using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, several precautions should be taken to ensure safety and prevent damage to the vehicle's components. Firstly, it is crucial to keep the nozzle of the high-pressure cleaner sufficiently away from the vehicle. Bringing the nozzle too close or pointing it directly at the front grill, bumper, or other openings can cause damage to the vehicle's body and parts. This is because high-pressure water can penetrate these areas, leading to potential leaks, corrosion, or even structural damage.\n\nAdditionally, pointing the nozzle at door glasses and door frames can allow water to enter the cabin, which can cause electrical malfunctions or water damage to the interior. To avoid these issues, it is essential to maintain a safe distance and ensure that the nozzle is directed away from sensitive areas.\n\nThese precautions are necessary to protect the vehicle's integrity and functionality. Damage from high-pressure water can compromise the vehicle's structural strength, electrical systems, and overall performance. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your vehicle remains in good condition and operates safely.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[530,336,529,340,532,144,350,388,246,483,132,265,527,142,330,429,533,267,303,465,528,111,365,381,418,531,239,122,126,459,534,376,425,208,314,390,371,206,379,382,384,387,521,204,537,48,121,225,252,353,378,91,253,380,479,494,103,258,263,403,424,453,212,254,255,302,423,452,466,515,226,275,374,377,426,518,525,389,63,221,256,266,349,357,373,520,58,116,385,404,457,472,496,523,102,110,115,510,71,250,486,93,113,296,482,513,514,524,52,101,104,229,14,145,150,240,392,416,488,72,90,125,241,245,273,274,454,470,497,519,57,59,66,112,209,238,391,401,464,44,187,372,396,55,56,159,174,213,361,398,493,45,61,62,70,244,268,354,397,428,522,558,46,47,50,51,60,75,88,98,117,207,217,285,375,417,568,65,69,87,205,222,291,299,554,97,149,196,243,276,352,355,410,458,489,105,129,242,315,348,366,400,427,541,3,22,74,124,133,134,137,192,358,491,49,257,284,288,356,409,422,492,495,511,551,569,33,54,227,269,362,446,455,512,37,139,321,436,463,485,516,94,143,310,319,324,399,434,499,53,277,308,395,118,154,163,188,293,393,432,451,109,114,437,438,462,2,305,333,447,448,461,481,89,218,228,550,108,190,191,316,327,339,342,369,433,526,556,106,152,304,4,83,162,247,261,344,419,430,517,553,67,107,210,219,249,364,175,211,260,367,484,120,135,230,335,368,442,443,444,23,25,92,202,487,11,38,78,439,220,223,449,540,542,84,127,153,64,141,146,320,322,323,347,363,456,338,77,177,232,272,544,557,1,10,95,248,292,351,415,471,473,477,555,79,99,193,287,406,552,68,236,264,311,7,96,279,507,73,307,412,476,155,170,214,270,309,318,138,370,5,200,233,294,467,36,136,140,158,186,383,411,478,6,30,216,278,508,271,329,504,100,237,440,128,130,160,259,282,312,405,408,27,31,345,505,313,326,468,475,545,17,35,148,185,337,343,469,325,346,546,32,119,172,203,251,262,297,317,543,298,21,157,231,328,359,460,147,180,498,502,224,235,281,474,24,161,194,234,300,306,450,490,215,445,151,164,166,535,13,41,81,131,8,123,331,171,280,301,76,86,286,181,435,334,414,9,82,156,184,283,332,413,16,183,189,386,407,561,12,42,506,29,567,80,169,195,431,18,34,201,295,536,549,182,197,26,40,85,167,178,290,570,15,28,503,20,564,566,198,199,39,165,341,173,480,421,509,548,289,360,538,500,19,176,402,168,420,563,394,441,501,565,43,560,559,179,562,547,539],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Impact from the side to the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment\n2. Impact from the side at an oblique angle\n\nThese scenarios are particularly dangerous for occupants for several reasons:\n\n1. In a side impact to the passenger compartment, the airbags are designed to inflate to protect occupants from the force of the impact. However, if the impact is to another part of the vehicle body, the airbags may not deploy as intended. This could result in severe injuries to occupants who are not properly restrained by seat belts.\n\n2. An oblique side impact can be particularly dangerous because it may not trigger the airbag sensors as effectively as a direct side impact. This could lead to the airbags not inflating at all, leaving occupants vulnerable to severe injuries from the force of the impact.\n\nIn both cases, occupants may be at risk of serious injuries due to the lack of proper restraint and protection from the airbags.

Highlights: Increasing the Highlights setting (moving the slider to the right) will make the bright areas of the image appear brighter and more contrasted. This can enhance the contrast between the highlights and the surrounding midtones and shadows. Conversely, decreasing the Highlights setting (moving the slider to the left) will make the highlights appear darker and less contrasted, potentially losing detail in bright areas.\n\n2. Shadows: Increasing the Shadows setting (moving the slider to the right) will make the dark areas of the image appear darker and more contrasted. This can enhance the contrast between the shadows and the surrounding midtones and highlights. Decreasing the Shadows setting (moving the slider to the left) will make the shadows appear lighter and less contrasted, potentially losing detail in dark areas.\n\nBy adjusting these settings, you can control how much contrast is applied to the highlights and shadows separately. This allows for more precise control over the overall tonal range and contrast of the image. For example, you might increase the Highlights setting to bring out detail in bright areas while keeping the Shadows setting low to avoid losing detail in darker areas. Alternatively, you could increase both settings to enhance the contrast throughout the image, or decrease both to create a more muted, low-contrast look.","source":"data/test/xt50.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[264,167,168,6,4,236,16,19,169,52,159,235,139,166,158,262,265,178,148,336,361,365,331,208,352,366,173,20,164,332,372,328,374,7,160,165,254,150,161,162,170,231,251,98,114,232,48,182,193,13,242,177,389,51,141,252,325,329,368,10,56,140,157,5,89,152,342,8,22,23,61,125,132,253,257,392,124,326,118,138,163,17,43,54,393,209,222,18,45,127,154,184,212,229,330,359,418,101,228,259,348,33,103,370,57,188,198,220,226,134,192,15,99,181,237,240,324,55,104,128,145,327,344,390,46,109,394,91,110,137,210,244,319,430,37,96,151,142,203,221,238,258,427,75,122,217,218,272,425,431,80,84,133,197,351,369,423,9,93,200,275,318,371,388,50,250,59,180,196,243,34,36,108,172,179,282,406,213,224,249,312,315,349,426,119,194,211,230,337,341,395,126,261,320,362,24,97,120,214,234,309,333,355,102,189,353,385,14,39,123,183,199,241,335,339,340,386,440,129,247,248,396,405,442,187,191,274,38,42,215,245,136,155,171,216,263,391,438,63,100,105,205,206,227,190,204,357,363,106,175,223,399,41,58,77,112,387,87,92,115,146,233,436,32,53,149,225,239,334,338,346,422,429,439,186,283,311,381,407,11,35,49,64,202,354,419,12,29,268,345,88,201,255,281,288,313,321,72,113,130,174,347,397,256,260,269,297,302,400,403,445,447,40,44,76,78,310,411,413,424,60,95,107,153,156,287,303,408,409,437,79,135,144,147,377,47,121,176,219,246,277,322,382,384,441,86,289,343,83,94,185,307,364,383,421,434,435,21,62,116,143,195,299,402,415,28,30,66,73,74,398,420,26,85,316,267,273,284,358,373,404,25,90,305,308,356,376,410,414,68,266,278,290,317,446,31,71,111,117,271,279,292,314,444,2,295,296,428,443,207,270,323,285,70,350,380,306,375,433,69,293,81,417,3,294,448,82,286,301,304,378,401,291,367,276,1,131,298,416,379,432,280,412,300,360,27,67,65],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The accompanying note states: \"The roles played by the front command dial can be changed using D BUTTON/DIAL SETTING > COMMAND DIAL SETTING.\"\n\nThis indicates that the command dial's function can be customized, and in this case, it has been assigned to allow aperture adjustment. However, the note also specifies that this function is only available \"when the lens is not equipped with an aperture ring or if the aperture ring is in the A position.\" \n\nThis means that the command dial can be used to adjust the aperture only when the lens does not have an aperture ring or when the lens's aperture ring is set to the \"A\" position, which typically disables manual aperture control. This restriction ensures that the command dial's aperture adjustment function is only available under specific conditions related to the camera's settings and lens type.","source":"data/test/xt50.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[101,108,110,36,23,382,10,38,103,381,346,109,39,347,37,114,150,259,58,125,340,422,98,104,33,102,145,184,192,99,100,129,386,89,165,338,341,363,128,235,30,55,193,4,107,123,157,204,138,60,143,178,369,388,121,343,366,372,394,5,6,232,13,15,117,213,344,17,120,137,189,358,374,32,35,115,119,273,367,393,111,197,385,387,390,116,375,384,34,147,194,318,373,45,82,151,188,268,315,41,52,131,191,368,7,112,430,57,91,210,212,330,31,51,214,322,345,423,56,59,105,339,392,421,25,96,97,141,152,170,244,307,350,391,40,43,124,276,348,198,325,370,127,166,179,182,187,260,272,331,365,383,427,9,76,164,240,362,364,378,440,18,139,149,177,208,239,261,324,333,77,238,242,275,320,371,442,71,84,130,195,342,361,389,406,411,431,22,66,81,126,257,285,335,132,146,183,217,227,252,295,319,328,435,16,61,133,231,241,254,311,352,19,53,144,196,216,230,247,262,284,297,397,403,424,432,12,24,70,75,93,163,199,211,245,399,416,428,73,190,206,226,404,417,443,113,134,253,304,327,349,405,418,419,425,65,92,158,281,292,439,44,106,118,135,181,209,271,290,312,316,351,438,42,202,233,236,249,264,294,298,309,380,407,64,155,162,173,246,258,313,83,88,90,201,237,286,287,293,299,305,306,308,359,426,20,46,54,136,200,215,251,336,379,21,69,80,243,301,326,329,353,408,434,49,122,140,148,160,167,221,223,265,429,14,27,72,185,203,402,409,48,205,250,291,300,396,47,142,169,172,207,218,400,171,303,332,415,11,154,180,277,282,302,413,68,159,186,334,398,414,50,67,168,337,28,85,248,323,1,228,229,274,310,410,8,220,280,401,161,219,234,321,433,270,288,289,2,74,296,436,278,441,153,225,256,263,266,354,412,175,222,224,283,314,377,437,444,176,355,420,3,174,356,267,95,62,86,360,87,269,279,376,447,78,448,94,445,446,26,79,255,317,357,395,156,63,29],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"What are the potential consequences of not holding the camera steady or obstructing the lens and AF-assist illuminator while taking a photograph in AUTO mode?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[80],"raw_output":"","pred":"Not holding the camera steady or obstructing the lens and AF-assist illuminator while taking a photograph in AUTO mode can lead to several undesirable consequences. Firstly, camera shake can cause blurred images, making the photograph less sharp and clear. This is because the camera's internal mechanisms, including the lens and sensor, need to be stable to capture a crisp image. If the camera is not held steady, the movement can be transferred to the image, resulting in a blurry outcome.\n\nSecondly, obstructing the lens and AF-assist illuminator can prevent the camera from focusing properly. The AF-assist illuminator helps the camera's autofocus system to lock onto the subject by illuminating it, especially in low-light conditions. If the lens or the illuminator is obstructed, the camera may struggle to focus, leading to out-of-focus images. This can be particularly problematic in AUTO mode, where the camera is continuously adjusting focus and searching for eyes, increasing the drain on the battery and the likelihood of missed shots.\n\nAdditionally, keeping fingers or other objects away from the lens and AF-assist illuminator ensures that the camera's sensors and light sources are not obstructed, which is crucial for optimal performance. Any interference can disrupt the autofocus process and reduce the quality of the photograph.","source":"data/test/xt50.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[80,187,390,145,189,81,89,424,14,191,73,5,136,57,435,140,15,40,213,233,200,237,88,150,393,30,102,143,198,16,103,107,169,352,406,419,17,96,101,118,147,244,36,109,245,100,188,202,98,403,38,91,117,124,208,135,167,313,361,440,39,119,126,137,316,45,113,114,328,330,422,163,166,308,351,382,383,423,105,125,183,210,247,41,99,111,131,158,182,211,112,195,199,271,347,37,43,123,216,241,288,346,369,389,421,205,231,375,431,10,76,120,207,242,408,7,48,115,121,236,293,300,371,152,239,56,196,290,292,342,23,42,44,66,104,130,192,227,287,311,322,411,13,31,64,72,194,286,305,332,438,24,68,180,181,193,345,401,416,417,51,69,92,138,139,186,373,374,397,82,106,110,127,177,184,277,362,370,384,394,404,418,19,65,122,149,204,295,344,414,427,432,21,52,108,197,306,366,407,67,144,230,240,294,304,309,378,381,385,387,402,425,6,61,179,243,331,11,22,32,90,173,273,324,372,405,129,218,224,272,327,348,368,386,4,178,203,212,363,409,430,70,142,206,214,297,315,364,367,83,84,128,253,254,320,350,365,426,12,18,25,47,93,162,234,291,410,442,35,50,60,75,116,141,155,164,185,190,232,274,301,325,333,391,429,49,97,209,246,250,302,338,353,359,46,58,132,201,238,281,284,298,388,413,428,77,133,259,261,9,53,54,157,215,226,278,299,335,339,343,380,74,257,275,303,318,420,434,85,151,252,264,285,337,437,71,282,307,312,323,340,379,399,59,146,260,268,270,276,319,355,358,33,55,134,223,249,251,412,165,170,217,280,392,154,171,266,267,336,228,258,265,433,439,28,262,329,148,296,8,27,400,441,220,396,248,221,334,289,349,235,269,436,20,443,62,175,326,354,415,156,222,398,159,263,95,174,3,172,341,310,321,376,219,314,447,26,356,229,360,87,2,445,256,279,94,78,86,176,446,1,161,448,444,34,225,160,29,168,317,153,63,357,283,377,255,79,395],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The NEC calculates the load based on the total connected load listed on the model/serial/rating plate, which is less than the actual connected load. For this range, the NEC calculated load is less than the total connected load of 15 kW at 120/240 V and 10 kW at 120/208 V. \n\nThe table indicates that for ranges with a rating of 15 kW at 120/240 V and 10 kW at 120/208 V, the specified ratings of power supply cord kits and circuit protection are 40 or 50 amperes. This means that the circuit protection and power supply cord must be rated at 40 or 50 amperes to ensure safety and proper functioning of the range. The higher rating (50 amperes) is recommended for a 50 A circuit, and kits that specify use with a nominal 13/8\" (3.5 cm) diameter connection opening are required. This ensures that the electrical connection is adequate and in compliance with the National Electrical Code and local codes and ordinances.","source":"data/test/ksdb900ess.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[11,10,38,39,16,17,44,7,45,12,14,28,18,8,19,48,47,36,37,15,25,1,40,4,27,46,23,42,35,31,43,58,20,9,41,5,13,21,6,51,49,57,3,24,55,56,2,54,26,34,50,53,33,29,32,22,59,30,52,60,61,62,63,64],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What are the specific requirements and considerations for connecting a range to a 4-wire electrical system in Canada, and how do they differ from the requirements for a 3-wire system in the U.S.A.?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[11],"raw_output":"","pred":"In Canada, connecting a range to a 4-wire electrical system involves several specific requirements and considerations. Firstly, the ground must be revised so that the green ground wire of the 4-wire power supply cord is connected to the cabinet. This is crucial to ensure proper grounding and prevent electrical hazards. The range is equipped with a CSA International Certified Power Cord intended to be plugged into a standard 14-50R wall receptacle, which must be within reach of the range’s final location. It is important to note that using an extension cord is not recommended.\n\nFor a 3-wire system in the U.S.A., the requirements are different. The fourth (grounding) conductor must be identified by a green or green/yellow cover, and the neutral conductor must be identified by a white cover. The cord should be Type SRD or SRDT with a UL listed strain relief and be at least 4 ft (1.22 m) long. The minimum conductor sizes for a 40 A circuit are 2 No.-8 conductors, 1 No.-10 white neutral, and 1 No.-10 green grounding. For a 50 A circuit, the conductor sizes are 2 No.-8 conductors, 1 No.-10 white neutral, and 1 No.-10 green grounding.\n\nIn summary, the key differences lie in the grounding requirements, the type of receptacle used, and the conductor sizes and types, with Canada requiring a 4-wire system and the U.S.A. allowing both 3-wire and 4-wire systems.","source":"data/test/ksdb900ess.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[10,11,1,12,8,16,14,17,7,28,25,39,23,27,19,36,40,46,24,44,48,3,15,2,26,4,47,13,18,38,49,45,51,5,43,20,21,53,9,31,59,56,30,54,22,34,41,32,50,42,37,58,35,57,6,29,55,52,33,60,61,62,63,64],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2 - Mostly Incorrect","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The towed vehicle is depicted with a black arrow indicating it is being pulled by a rope or cable. This scenario presents a challenge for the PFCW system because it may not be able to accurately detect the towed vehicle as a potential collision risk.\n\nThe text explains that the PFCW system uses radar to measure distances and detect vehicles ahead. However, when a vehicle is being towed, the radar may not be able to properly capture the towed vehicle's position or movement. This could lead to the system failing to warn the driver of a potential collision risk when the towed vehicle is in the same lane.\n\nThe image serves as a visual representation of this limitation, emphasizing that drivers should be aware that the PFCW system may not function correctly in situations involving towed vehicles.

It helps reduce the explosion hazard by covering the battery terminals and vent caps. This minimizes the risk of sparks or flames reaching the battery's exposed parts.\n\n2. The moist cloth absorbs any battery fluid that may leak out, preventing it from coming into contact with eyes, skin, clothing, or painted surfaces. This reduces the risk of severe burns or chemical burns.\n\n3. It provides a barrier between the battery and any nearby objects, reducing the chance of accidental contact that could cause a short circuit or fire.\n\n4. The moist cloth helps dissipate heat from the battery, which can be generated during the jump starting process. This can prevent the battery from overheating and potentially exploding.\n\n5. It allows for a more controlled jump starting process, as the moist cloth can help absorb any excess battery fluid that may spill during the procedure.\n\nBy covering the battery with a moist cloth, the instructions aim to create a safer environment for jump starting, reducing the risk of injury or damage to the vehicle or surrounding area.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[445,444,472,461,541,446,448,267,471,538,433,498,266,268,251,437,467,155,262,408,536,159,430,537,256,525,220,269,480,255,270,454,540,204,458,410,413,431,447,456,188,232,420,462,263,275,276,474,149,261,271,407,412,469,224,526,23,194,264,278,316,434,442,28,32,63,64,156,259,260,440,486,152,163,326,426,455,465,475,164,274,468,502,524,535,2,18,26,40,59,79,125,153,170,182,217,168,181,222,288,304,405,464,499,27,42,77,80,176,195,233,254,322,337,369,386,402,441,466,24,138,139,178,200,324,362,414,417,459,473,523,124,177,185,189,190,203,306,395,484,516,123,154,166,302,330,342,364,376,411,425,451,490,539,39,103,201,207,406,517,36,50,205,248,300,343,372,403,513,531,47,121,130,184,253,381,453,491,493,497,4,25,34,52,106,129,143,151,161,191,196,206,272,318,338,346,378,435,436,438,470,527,55,71,127,169,187,235,298,379,385,398,429,528,15,17,37,46,54,100,104,110,374,415,416,443,494,20,30,53,61,76,108,135,144,202,236,237,240,290,294,345,424,518,542,88,91,96,102,158,165,175,193,209,223,226,234,371,400,428,38,49,58,60,78,160,186,199,242,273,283,336,347,349,357,367,388,478,35,44,68,118,128,137,142,192,210,243,247,277,280,315,360,368,382,383,384,389,396,477,501,45,56,75,94,122,141,145,162,218,221,257,305,311,320,328,333,359,373,401,423,463,504,522,62,85,105,245,258,303,340,390,399,457,41,43,86,208,219,265,295,317,323,341,353,397,427,432,450,489,51,57,65,148,215,282,312,476,48,107,171,172,216,231,284,285,296,307,310,325,335,348,11,70,87,109,126,147,183,198,308,321,363,370,375,377,394,404,418,419,439,544,10,31,33,112,230,249,293,301,334,355,483,82,99,212,299,327,492,496,529,29,74,93,113,134,146,180,319,356,366,387,391,393,481,505,6,9,22,66,133,173,227,252,279,292,314,344,352,354,358,365,422,69,117,119,211,281,329,479,482,488,19,67,132,361,380,421,3,289,331,351,503,8,92,136,225,409,449,81,95,246,286,287,297,97,114,519,72,515,530,14,115,213,244,509,532,239,332,500,116,157,241,392,512,520,521,197,291,309,485,140,179,229,313,339,21,89,111,350,508,98,101,131,228,83,511,7,12,13,84,460,120,167,238,5,90,487,506,507,543,214,495,73,150,510,534,533,514,1,174,452,250,16],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"What are the limitations and appropriate usage conditions of the ACC system, and why is it crucial for the driver to remain attentive and in control even when the system is active?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[327],"raw_output":"","pred":"The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is designed to assist the driver in maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and adjusting speed accordingly. However, it has several limitations and specific usage conditions. The ACC system does not function in all driving, traffic, weather, and road conditions, and it cannot react to stationary or slow-moving vehicles. It is primarily intended for highway use and is not suitable for city driving. The system can only apply up to 40% of the vehicle's total braking power, which may not be sufficient in certain situations.\n\nThe ACC system is not a collision warning or avoidance device; it is an aid to assist the driver. It is crucial for the driver to remain attentive and in control of the vehicle at all times, even when the ACC system is active. The driver must be prepared to manually control the vehicle's speed and distance from other vehicles, especially in situations where the ACC system may not be able to maintain the selected distance or speed. Additionally, the driver must observe posted speed limits and not set the speed over them.

{"question":"What are the potential drawbacks of enabling the \"Install unknown apps\" permission and the \"Alarms & reminders\" permission on your tablet?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[103],"raw_output":"","pred":"Enabling the \"Install unknown apps\" permission on your tablet can make it more vulnerable to attack by unknown apps. This is because allowing apps from unknown sources increases the risk of downloading malware, viruses, or other malicious software that can compromise your device's security and personal data. Additionally, these apps may not be subject to the same security checks and updates as those from official sources, potentially leaving your tablet more susceptible to vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\nEnabling the \"Alarms & reminders\" permission can also have potential drawbacks. While it allows apps to set alarms and schedule time-sensitive actions, it can lead to increased battery usage. Apps running in the background to monitor alarms and reminders may consume more power, potentially shortening the battery life of your tablet. Furthermore, if the app is not well-managed, it could consume unnecessary resources, impacting the overall performance and responsiveness of your device.","source":"data/test/miui_14.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[18,103,102,105,114,94,25,72,100,106,91,88,115,89,90,80,104,28,59,78,92,108,17,12,11,15,26,86,110,4,37,71,16,21,43,93,113,7,42,107,118,120,32,41,99,10,22,29,40,79,117,35,36,75,33,38,50,74,101,109,2,8,19,20,87,119,23,56,6,31,44,47,58,70,76,95,39,85,97,81,27,48,111,3,49,73,116,14,24,30,45,65,98,55,57,60,82,112,34,67,9,69,96,13,53,62,66,68,61,64,77,84,63,52,5,83,46,51,54,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Here are the steps you should follow:\n\n1. **Identify the SSID**: Since the SSID is not automatically detected, you will need to find the SSID name. This information is typically provided on a label attached to the WLAN access point/router. If the label is not visible, you can use the manufacturer's name or model number as the default security settings.\n\n2. **Check Documentation**: Refer to the documentation provided with your WLAN access point/router. The instructions will guide you on how to find the SSID and other security settings.\n\n3. **Enter the SSID Manually**: Once you have the SSID name, you will need to enter it manually into the device you are trying to connect.

In such cases, you might need to use other methods like browsing by date or location to find the best photos.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[622,566,518,617,563,311,511,561,680,87,521,4,180,309,184,618,6,565,187,303,562,615,679,623,301,522,532,533,312,519,621,836,516,627,692,859,875,319,689,910,529,572,607,614,514,564,575,580,619,842,631,634,812,512,546,557,513,624,628,9,411,527,543,569,630,651,19,318,525,531,574,578,714,877,191,196,310,333,608,743,7,197,335,523,666,668,694,721,786,834,843,119,395,534,596,633,636,195,216,255,308,331,548,573,576,893,218,332,412,413,554,571,696,699,813,852,854,120,283,286,337,343,552,678,5,73,315,317,601,603,629,313,324,459,550,556,559,592,595,626,83,277,320,322,398,590,591,660,794,856,885,125,127,258,328,330,558,612,664,894,110,179,185,267,334,541,567,798,853,121,189,393,517,535,549,570,616,640,658,691,693,787,857,194,326,341,387,493,537,577,582,598,600,609,665,695,701,708,791,835,881,122,124,186,316,376,381,502,515,520,545,579,594,613,672,739,814,892,85,91,108,138,153,214,291,544,606,663,681,707,810,846,860,141,159,181,321,348,402,602,653,656,670,677,57,90,94,104,284,306,327,344,366,391,415,524,581,593,605,611,625,675,753,776,792,849,855,3,10,84,112,161,254,279,323,336,356,463,468,586,646,654,858,886,102,202,266,268,325,357,365,446,471,597,635,878,49,117,167,193,217,228,539,547,568,587,589,620,722,731,736,775,821,872,29,39,109,123,205,269,280,282,290,295,377,401,530,536,588,599,642,682,706,741,763,848,868,876,898,50,81,136,139,152,190,232,235,262,281,299,367,373,382,414,498,509,555,632,674,715,718,729,760,767,815,911,132,219,221,227,239,253,273,274,338,350,384,460,479,481,508,697,724,758,880,101,154,157,188,203,211,374,380,496,499,553,662,700,732,747,768,782,796,799,869,897,913,25,28,51,107,118,199,230,233,292,345,354,406,417,424,430,501,669,710,757,777,789,790,797,803,832,888,95,96,158,163,213,342,432,480,526,551,583,604,837,99,113,114,140,171,215,287,364,408,435,440,483,703,709,733,745,820,34,60,69,111,151,160,183,209,298,304,359,362,389,416,486,610,702,711,847,92,129,240,329,452,466,641,698,805,807,8,31,38,88,137,192,260,353,487,510,79,93,106,207,307,349,372,497,500,819,212,236,278,407,410,478,542,650,661,688,806,56,76,100,142,206,224,305,355,392,433,495,652,655,673,705,723,870,52,294,404,436,447,457,560,667,738,764,808,26,71,98,115,241,243,250,259,340,361,378,540,730,795,850,895,900,15,53,270,285,300,371,420,637,683,717,725,742,778,785,866,889,891,902,916,21,116,174,198,244,314,375,394,584,671,783,802,896,86,156,275,276,360,368,421,423,441,454,491,494,766,771,801,18,442,451,467,538,645,647,690,713,770,788,804,887,901,134,289,456,488,657,751,809,914,155,234,237,242,379,450,506,712,727,840,46,170,172,261,386,426,428,482,687,719,752,818,89,103,182,246,352,358,383,390,399,405,429,473,503,648,735,746,769,800,851,917,82,126,164,168,288,296,302,419,528,874,909,54,80,223,248,264,293,438,458,477,772,774,816,862,864,97,131,148,165,249,257,388,409,431,470,676,761,823,833,883,130,147,200,263,272,297,418,485,585,720,737,826,867,251,339,475,490,639,740,762,773,1,12,45,128,173,208,225,448,793,863,879,222,229,396,474,861,58,162,403,465,489,492,643,704,765,61,105,178,256,385,434,443,507,659,744,784,871,72,422,686,726,750,873,33,62,135,204,210,346,455,464,716,781,908,48,175,427,734,829,838,47,150,245,252,363,425,453,22,169,220,445,469,476,649,685,748,845,865,40,43,484,505,728,844,16,226,265,271,754,780,830,899,68,145,238,27,44,397,461,906,20,149,247,449,472,817,177,779,919,462,756,839,907,23,70,77,439,822,35,176,828,11,32,37,74,78,644,684,755,827,17,24,133,146,444,825,905,42,66,890,918,369,30,201,882,904,166,351,75,370,400,437,2,504,759,63,67,144,231,347,841,41,64,915,749,13,36,638,811,59,65,824,831,14,912,884,903,55,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How does the file numbering system change when creating a new folder on Card 1, and how does this differ from the file numbering reset that occurs when switching from Card 1 to Card 2?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[770],"raw_output":"","pred":"When creating a new folder on Card 1, the file numbering system resets to 0001 for the new folder. This means that the next image saved to this new folder will be numbered 0001, and subsequent images will follow sequentially.\n\nIn contrast, when switching from Card 1 to Card 2, the file numbering system does not reset to 0001. Instead, the file numbering continues from the last file number used on Card 1. This means that the next image saved to Card 2 will be numbered 0001, but this is not a reset; rather, it's a continuation of the numbering sequence from Card 1.\n\nThe key difference is that creating a new folder on Card 1 forces a manual reset to 0001, while switching to a new card (Card 2) simply continues the existing numbering sequence from the previous card. This allows for more flexibility in organizing images by folders or cards while maintaining a consistent numbering system across different storage locations.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[770,769,768,771,8,761,760,764,772,767,778,766,875,781,602,418,565,51,697,765,775,777,774,812,48,569,808,807,546,868,287,836,46,567,269,806,870,252,362,680,763,810,695,22,102,571,608,741,378,886,358,550,696,815,279,306,485,540,278,286,556,561,701,7,572,576,190,303,611,613,361,588,637,825,899,164,479,733,50,171,513,549,552,570,618,820,867,873,290,320,579,655,809,817,480,742,773,172,239,293,296,318,386,457,476,554,731,866,387,703,852,322,441,577,677,751,753,785,240,596,699,818,862,892,74,75,165,244,354,396,539,715,823,184,364,416,475,478,574,682,725,750,850,44,47,87,149,185,248,291,357,482,500,506,547,700,734,743,748,874,120,183,241,321,453,559,657,744,752,819,841,878,16,135,281,304,399,414,514,647,689,694,714,721,735,747,851,28,40,79,186,196,297,388,413,491,532,568,597,612,632,639,839,865,910,59,112,127,250,254,341,587,590,600,645,860,58,131,182,282,365,477,698,724,786,894,896,3,49,54,63,140,274,324,326,417,426,452,511,620,666,727,762,780,883,34,305,328,340,496,497,509,516,557,621,654,679,688,717,783,800,856,187,330,342,343,372,427,510,580,623,707,729,755,757,821,831,864,898,6,233,238,276,300,315,327,350,390,415,472,543,617,732,797,848,858,31,95,101,123,170,198,199,232,339,345,359,484,599,610,683,690,796,801,863,885,906,916,2,81,132,251,294,323,467,537,573,635,681,702,889,4,56,173,191,224,253,277,283,338,421,481,508,518,595,609,640,648,650,693,745,787,793,794,845,861,888,33,147,155,157,215,266,273,299,366,384,422,450,451,619,718,738,813,842,847,36,159,205,222,353,455,501,583,705,843,849,897,89,128,174,179,188,203,216,218,298,380,385,423,424,425,459,493,505,517,592,624,628,642,652,675,686,814,832,855,114,151,156,177,181,332,376,377,431,490,605,799,846,871,55,104,280,288,430,445,461,519,566,606,651,736,788,834,835,838,26,45,116,161,200,212,217,223,292,346,349,360,460,502,507,548,563,578,581,684,730,776,822,57,62,73,118,124,163,193,213,220,228,236,333,435,436,466,495,527,560,564,598,607,636,661,676,791,792,907,913,99,221,234,356,382,407,412,443,468,544,616,656,710,711,712,790,826,830,833,902,10,66,144,162,219,245,403,428,463,483,488,531,716,726,740,784,880,891,901,30,121,125,134,237,489,541,586,601,670,746,795,816,904,12,32,35,43,52,84,145,242,265,375,381,420,464,523,524,558,622,672,709,779,798,840,869,11,17,25,60,92,146,194,195,227,247,285,331,336,367,393,395,437,499,525,704,789,805,859,908,918,42,98,106,169,255,337,348,536,584,614,633,663,719,759,837,872,877,130,153,167,189,257,259,268,272,289,295,301,311,312,319,401,442,591,630,660,692,706,723,804,824,909,9,85,137,246,256,313,379,394,402,404,446,447,470,534,562,604,827,919,5,64,80,86,129,197,225,229,230,352,398,400,406,486,515,535,551,575,589,634,641,668,737,782,828,915,90,105,108,143,148,175,202,231,235,307,374,512,545,585,615,653,665,674,900,61,115,117,126,160,207,243,262,284,317,370,405,504,529,629,1,65,176,210,264,371,391,432,526,758,914,38,103,206,275,314,369,392,433,454,538,594,649,685,691,802,905,70,133,178,325,434,440,520,593,603,664,671,749,803,911,39,82,100,122,192,270,410,411,444,643,678,94,150,166,201,214,368,667,722,876,890,77,88,93,119,139,142,249,383,448,465,474,522,533,673,713,844,78,111,209,344,373,658,687,754,829,895,23,113,152,158,168,226,498,669,18,29,71,180,389,492,582,659,879,19,24,37,53,110,154,271,355,439,449,555,625,644,728,109,136,204,334,363,429,438,473,503,553,739,756,881,884,887,208,211,302,308,351,458,469,917,267,309,471,521,542,720,857,893,15,20,91,631,83,494,708,811,67,335,408,260,462,68,419,854,14,69,96,107,530,13,21,141,261,456,626,853,903,97,263,627,662,138,76,316,329,397,646,310,409,528,912,72,258,27,882,487,638,41,347],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"Which shooting mode would be most appropriate for capturing a wide vista of a mountain range with a flowing river in the foreground, assuming you want to maximize depth of field and scenic detail?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[34],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the shooting modes described in the image, the most appropriate mode for capturing a wide vista of a mountain range with a flowing river in the foreground would be Landscape mode.\n\nLandscape mode is specifically designed for expansive scenery, as indicated by the icon of a mountain range. The description states that it keeps everything in focus from near to far, which is ideal for capturing the entire vista of the mountain range and the river in the foreground.\n\nAdditionally, Landscape mode is noted for producing vivid blues and greens, and sharp, crisp images. This would help preserve the natural beauty and details of the mountain landscape and river.\n\nWhile other modes like Panoramic Shot Mode could potentially be used, Landscape mode is more directly tailored to capturing wide, expansive views of natural scenery. It likely offers settings optimized for depth of field and clarity across the entire scene, making it the best choice for this type of landscape photography.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[110,111,100,109,285,498,353,112,219,888,132,277,101,131,193,205,501,739,129,786,81,89,230,323,758,121,345,349,203,587,596,694,416,541,57,499,894,103,127,542,588,892,291,107,115,562,608,885,126,236,257,509,519,104,255,579,666,891,597,610,510,518,607,632,114,119,120,142,374,537,105,227,287,383,384,535,586,624,402,536,590,613,692,701,401,551,602,611,34,299,337,348,386,534,578,609,612,693,123,139,290,373,532,665,872,889,31,113,128,152,307,573,94,97,117,124,552,672,887,71,93,118,99,108,215,239,366,433,508,543,580,663,670,836,96,305,595,664,18,424,458,598,913,83,91,92,134,367,153,186,228,315,417,437,674,130,461,619,76,174,321,451,547,98,122,158,252,336,630,213,224,262,308,346,372,392,909,106,154,181,194,196,288,432,468,599,35,296,350,355,415,486,560,886,19,84,146,231,387,395,446,521,668,787,904,908,238,243,406,453,3,27,32,176,188,211,223,316,320,407,434,438,680,895,137,140,218,264,298,334,359,726,789,871,162,179,195,275,306,376,445,470,538,795,72,87,151,180,248,343,354,388,601,136,185,235,269,286,339,418,439,503,539,559,604,869,906,116,144,157,313,457,487,533,90,170,232,242,283,311,342,460,469,524,95,133,217,225,340,450,500,502,681,737,832,898,905,8,135,192,202,246,261,272,274,289,419,443,522,528,634,863,875,30,52,164,178,184,199,214,341,454,623,868,187,206,254,265,333,379,575,760,796,849,870,75,150,197,253,258,260,280,281,309,332,467,697,699,833,877,4,50,125,168,284,435,459,585,714,791,794,827,838,842,867,20,28,148,161,183,212,241,244,293,322,324,338,422,471,523,568,662,776,165,182,204,240,247,360,380,391,440,481,483,485,778,878,38,62,245,278,331,381,473,496,540,622,633,695,715,754,826,149,169,229,233,279,335,427,455,464,529,618,628,688,755,777,835,874,5,17,156,200,250,251,294,476,505,574,584,615,679,719,825,828,829,910,65,74,189,198,221,267,268,273,282,319,344,429,449,526,700,738,837,899,177,216,295,318,420,425,472,474,488,507,545,557,605,621,648,751,775,830,897,2,6,37,42,102,147,297,317,325,475,527,531,689,907,60,61,270,301,347,352,382,393,423,430,431,462,463,491,567,626,750,766,816,25,143,190,249,314,357,364,398,426,428,436,466,495,511,606,696,782,840,10,26,58,69,85,207,226,263,312,358,390,452,497,530,603,722,790,820,864,1,40,47,222,259,365,389,411,477,480,492,493,563,660,675,736,843,903,16,54,77,82,159,276,400,441,442,444,447,490,504,614,616,709,797,857,896,901,73,292,300,329,412,544,581,650,659,732,767,802,818,821,844,856,859,866,63,86,163,385,558,617,690,698,711,860,862,45,46,53,59,78,175,201,210,234,378,394,396,465,546,548,553,561,571,653,661,793,839,167,208,361,405,408,478,520,525,554,564,569,572,582,636,651,685,702,798,824,855,861,881,893,911,21,64,141,160,166,303,369,479,494,550,834,44,80,266,351,482,489,512,592,641,678,703,761,900,902,22,68,145,172,514,549,640,684,808,66,171,362,594,629,669,687,712,763,858,23,88,368,371,576,686,691,764,788,810,819,138,302,330,421,570,643,677,779,780,781,792,809,854,43,155,220,404,413,566,577,716,717,721,683,708,735,743,748,772,785,812,375,448,516,555,647,823,29,173,565,725,822,879,48,271,326,456,556,768,771,815,916,24,36,67,328,397,409,515,631,706,730,817,880,237,399,620,658,851,914,49,310,484,517,583,718,801,873,883,7,15,327,649,720,884,33,39,506,671,765,806,191,209,656,644,654,733,783,14,256,377,403,414,600,682,740,51,635,710,747,769,9,356,410,645,79,304,363,625,627,673,593,655,713,745,749,865,13,642,707,724,742,753,876,646,728,11,591,667,513,589,705,723,704,731,773,841,55,370,752,813,657,762,744,800,805,807,56,70,756,846,853,12,639,652,729,741,774,770,784,676,637,757,811,919,41,734,746,850,804,727,799,890,814,912,803,848,852,638,845,759,918,882,915,831,917,847],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is particularly problematic when trying to evaluate the correction's impact, as the noise can obscure the intended improvement in the image corners.\n","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[260,584,259,195,409,299,336,264,585,231,269,127,206,219,261,437,392,417,452,121,218,26,118,53,278,337,263,334,120,265,354,108,152,199,367,119,224,262,387,335,604,318,869,109,214,221,266,313,316,449,458,460,605,112,459,474,76,116,162,253,373,414,699,876,95,126,213,257,286,371,606,754,879,86,96,122,258,267,273,408,447,471,607,799,871,894,28,51,350,365,500,611,681,85,179,237,268,270,298,380,451,456,493,619,695,755,866,888,90,200,249,340,415,740,229,232,291,511,545,583,810,878,4,113,170,175,490,502,776,5,25,223,239,87,157,158,431,540,610,801,863,165,183,461,569,629,893,114,296,372,688,701,6,132,700,368,412,919,716,201,275,280,407,434,864,872,58,212,243,301,308,358,381,144,154,194,488,508,513,523,576,774,865,125,147,581,890,235,359,399,475,491,844,68,69,236,406,463,571,592,613,737,10,29,72,117,238,433,438,516,601,636,753,791,45,106,159,166,248,589,784,797,825,868,107,168,174,338,413,445,470,577,780,81,103,307,479,486,637,7,19,404,496,497,618,886,889,124,140,211,375,391,532,639,874,24,135,137,226,357,398,867,891,2,34,50,100,374,444,524,586,628,687,877,882,57,66,123,177,205,483,543,546,597,620,768,837,12,23,79,80,134,225,242,256,287,403,478,495,777,245,254,364,469,537,600,711,722,289,675,679,800,826,905,54,164,361,370,416,446,454,587,875,82,172,519,579,627,842,110,167,353,506,560,588,805,8,89,215,230,252,395,405,480,489,522,626,678,750,873,94,160,240,281,477,482,512,514,794,803,833,142,290,315,397,487,650,662,744,798,843,862,887,910,18,47,115,149,356,443,654,748,811,840,881,883,255,272,448,515,558,602,603,743,757,775,831,852,44,145,246,435,507,596,616,630,674,751,128,182,202,528,652,756,762,793,796,812,821,823,27,186,227,288,317,326,331,333,772,362,442,544,593,696,726,105,139,228,274,329,418,453,686,760,816,839,870,3,11,203,271,455,468,481,549,556,591,666,735,752,802,832,39,92,102,150,241,310,323,339,378,424,529,550,20,56,61,153,181,185,450,457,517,530,590,617,702,60,151,430,792,820,855,93,156,197,421,527,691,817,141,222,282,344,396,426,440,441,472,476,734,758,789,901,904,75,83,129,247,320,328,330,432,621,719,804,822,824,277,295,420,427,531,672,761,763,783,836,858,896,32,91,184,193,297,302,494,566,659,728,787,795,818,31,422,428,429,467,473,660,747,781,790,33,65,84,143,173,250,341,466,609,614,633,918,67,74,101,342,423,526,598,653,658,713,742,835,16,187,198,216,324,325,376,536,623,685,697,715,718,730,813,892,903,73,171,304,322,327,360,366,383,425,572,624,643,819,828,861,906,35,52,180,309,321,343,369,384,402,503,547,622,651,656,693,733,749,815,880,900,916,13,191,220,436,485,553,669,732,746,909,41,70,155,161,345,388,525,612,644,649,36,98,104,136,188,276,311,632,759,769,834,902,30,38,319,382,439,505,557,567,647,724,727,788,856,885,913,914,279,635,838,49,133,146,210,283,292,501,521,539,631,642,663,689,770,841,845,42,169,233,411,484,492,667,741,767,771,1,14,55,77,217,464,520,534,552,565,608,646,655,773,782,189,284,348,582,677,729,739,807,830,9,88,148,176,196,303,306,332,386,504,555,574,625,648,725,745,764,895,111,130,312,419,533,575,657,690,710,738,778,859,912,15,379,615,676,684,694,714,765,786,857,899,48,300,349,673,731,897,908,131,535,580,640,698,706,717,898,71,138,163,190,244,251,462,559,570,705,709,785,809,827,853,17,22,62,78,99,465,548,704,43,207,285,305,355,385,394,554,568,671,723,806,347,363,390,561,208,293,352,518,562,563,594,638,720,829,917,21,294,551,564,573,664,665,683,692,37,40,510,680,814,851,854,911,46,97,849,64,234,346,377,645,808,63,393,410,707,59,389,538,578,736,766,703,192,541,670,682,599,661,721,779,846,314,499,542,634,668,847,509,884,209,351,400,401,850,595,860,204,708,848,498,178,907,641,712,915],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What are the differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds between the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter in still photo shooting, and how do these settings impact the use of flash?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[908],"raw_output":"","pred":"In still photo shooting, the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter have distinct shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds. The mechanical shutter allows for a wider range of shutter speeds, from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, including Bulb mode. The electronic 1st curtain shutter, on the other hand, offers a slightly narrower range, from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, also including Bulb mode. Both shutters support shutter speeds in 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop increments.\n\nThe X-sync speed for the mechanical shutter is 1/200 sec., while the electronic 1st curtain shutter has a fixed X-sync speed of 1/250 sec. This difference in X-sync speeds impacts the use of flash. The mechanical shutter can synchronize with flash at any shutter speed, making it versatile for various lighting conditions. In contrast, the electronic 1st curtain shutter has a fixed X-sync speed, which means it can only synchronize with flash at 1/250 sec. This limitation restricts the use of flash when the shutter speed is set to a slower value, potentially affecting the overall exposure and image quality.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[908,161,162,910,174,177,298,299,170,869,164,384,163,344,870,179,500,868,165,499,150,286,218,181,291,894,899,293,3,294,296,887,4,224,905,906,184,223,297,874,195,339,147,826,116,152,204,132,172,336,417,825,840,131,144,312,681,135,502,113,157,387,688,830,833,838,867,892,133,145,173,180,313,388,75,156,212,167,215,308,185,301,348,350,904,137,140,338,349,72,74,176,96,159,199,219,269,432,791,824,837,885,206,821,898,149,380,849,122,130,143,155,295,352,818,909,5,115,136,300,335,102,211,503,843,57,175,198,221,316,345,871,913,50,168,205,333,828,886,889,891,114,134,169,253,138,171,376,872,151,318,395,83,202,213,226,282,337,434,829,77,119,139,158,207,216,407,35,285,394,726,127,178,355,382,460,835,153,186,209,343,393,405,633,112,182,214,274,341,367,392,739,183,200,266,76,81,94,277,278,281,836,91,324,386,419,492,795,832,20,193,275,381,383,841,290,303,442,596,630,2,89,187,210,486,615,789,839,34,80,95,188,228,241,248,262,307,311,317,323,374,437,469,866,106,121,203,267,268,276,391,471,787,806,33,90,107,120,148,160,217,321,418,732,817,897,31,87,92,98,192,231,279,280,707,93,97,100,283,284,496,700,822,108,146,190,334,340,875,32,104,189,232,314,385,433,446,458,501,808,110,287,406,429,454,476,508,888,99,124,166,257,330,342,411,450,459,485,541,579,7,85,239,420,489,28,264,320,487,616,8,73,105,117,118,390,641,763,842,884,18,225,265,315,463,488,807,834,878,61,70,84,103,288,322,474,493,504,674,809,6,17,123,194,201,230,252,309,326,328,438,447,509,511,661,788,907,67,208,449,738,810,863,880,25,78,451,786,815,877,254,365,366,416,436,445,587,624,666,895,26,42,111,443,475,675,733,758,760,38,109,222,234,235,260,423,428,430,461,512,519,537,557,590,725,794,54,101,196,242,261,271,289,319,331,864,914,86,129,351,507,577,585,653,659,59,125,233,247,258,378,422,431,481,667,697,711,762,812,823,126,236,246,306,346,353,531,544,197,396,468,483,540,621,628,844,858,82,237,368,371,441,505,873,240,372,373,421,425,426,455,497,792,27,154,229,347,424,453,631,636,642,677,698,71,88,227,238,245,305,327,332,427,477,597,614,663,737,896,244,250,357,413,495,612,651,715,816,820,854,325,401,440,467,498,543,607,632,695,736,800,802,354,400,457,464,568,618,669,671,673,742,778,790,797,9,142,369,479,480,526,528,529,539,583,634,660,679,734,798,805,911,60,220,259,439,466,708,743,65,255,270,272,273,359,482,538,640,683,689,705,717,718,727,783,304,399,402,462,470,490,513,514,516,527,534,542,582,603,617,620,622,645,676,703,710,714,752,776,22,364,409,452,465,472,494,520,545,561,576,588,602,662,709,735,744,745,793,819,52,403,525,535,604,649,650,657,685,690,721,755,761,861,912,79,243,398,518,532,567,601,639,652,654,682,731,30,128,478,484,510,572,600,629,648,655,680,722,764,777,21,51,63,435,448,536,562,635,701,704,712,741,766,801,902,916,251,444,560,605,637,706,730,782,785,827,883,16,191,414,558,569,608,647,658,672,699,740,813,881,45,46,62,404,523,625,696,724,831,862,893,903,19,24,360,379,491,552,686,694,719,723,751,767,846,853,855,900,10,44,64,370,410,456,584,586,609,665,670,720,746,753,799,901,36,292,329,412,524,613,729,771,40,69,408,415,473,549,578,589,716,775,780,796,851,310,517,565,573,598,623,643,656,687,693,702,748,749,754,768,804,23,43,47,49,515,547,556,559,591,362,522,530,551,553,570,574,575,592,610,668,249,377,521,580,581,664,678,747,857,859,141,550,611,644,692,781,845,11,15,58,68,619,765,784,865,1,56,571,546,564,594,595,713,848,256,506,533,554,599,684,750,779,860,66,356,626,774,847,850,555,691,856,263,375,563,890,29,358,361,728,772,548,593,606,757,759,876,53,566,769,770,773,882,389,646,37,39,811,879,915,919,852,302,756,41,14,917,397,814,627,48,13,363,803,12,55,638,918],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Some services may have specific file type restrictions. If the file type is not supported, try converting the file to a different format that is compatible with the service.\n\n2. **Save as a Different Type**: If the file type is not the issue, save the file as a different type. For example, if the file is in JPEG format, try saving it as a PDF or another supported format.\n\n3. **Check for Corruptions**: Corrupted files can also cause upload errors. Try opening the file in a different application to see if it opens correctly. If it does not open or displays errors, the file may be corrupted. In this case, try getting a new, uncorrupted version of the file.\n\n4. **Wait and Try Again**: Sometimes, the issue might be temporary. Wait for a few minutes and try uploading the file again. If the problem persists, it might be a service-specific issue.\n\n5. **Access Service from Computer**: If the problem continues, access the service from a computer to confirm if it is unavailable.

N in 1 is more space-efficient for multiple pages, while poster printing produces a larger, more visually impactful output.","source":"data/test/mfcj1010dw.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[64,84,2,3,143,68,86,132,91,126,133,142,69,503,66,515,89,82,134,70,135,411,59,77,74,449,138,73,52,50,264,39,15,88,92,93,372,528,410,456,54,83,139,362,378,408,412,137,42,81,131,173,36,43,65,407,380,444,427,429,529,45,49,55,61,5,87,363,423,466,500,161,382,383,455,467,38,46,57,72,76,129,291,371,422,498,4,37,406,94,120,292,314,436,506,522,141,234,349,376,416,454,458,505,517,40,322,375,377,440,457,530,41,48,319,353,404,419,447,304,368,381,384,415,450,524,71,153,156,223,300,373,474,497,510,34,47,136,211,428,441,443,507,51,90,152,307,399,448,468,509,527,19,35,119,128,148,149,162,176,279,288,293,302,323,396,397,401,452,520,523,56,121,189,233,453,521,140,174,215,235,249,274,354,398,402,478,487,130,146,259,272,287,409,426,531,17,20,107,111,127,147,166,207,239,306,312,334,388,414,420,434,459,532,155,309,430,491,495,513,526,30,67,104,151,180,190,193,199,202,224,262,290,403,477,514,101,208,257,284,336,395,432,494,512,79,182,250,276,278,352,379,386,387,418,425,445,472,493,502,23,53,58,63,96,116,150,159,201,204,214,220,277,413,424,439,492,22,106,163,171,178,229,231,261,275,355,356,361,364,435,438,18,26,29,75,118,175,281,357,385,400,405,446,462,465,21,80,99,105,108,115,160,167,172,268,339,346,347,358,394,431,433,442,44,123,124,165,194,203,205,228,247,254,263,271,318,360,365,437,470,485,25,33,62,85,98,100,112,113,122,195,210,222,226,253,255,282,348,469,154,187,198,200,206,221,240,260,270,326,335,340,504,95,157,216,237,310,324,345,350,359,374,392,451,476,479,484,6,10,12,97,110,158,177,181,185,209,273,338,390,78,184,196,212,217,303,351,460,24,60,117,169,197,225,265,266,294,421,533,535,7,9,125,164,179,188,191,192,230,232,236,238,256,285,296,366,391,393,482,102,103,114,168,242,283,297,320,341,475,486,501,144,145,213,227,243,248,251,267,280,313,369,370,471,480,483,8,13,258,321,331,417,516,14,16,186,245,246,295,315,342,343,344,473,488,499,508,511,525,109,289,332,534,27,32,170,183,241,252,308,11,244,305,311,1,286,298,325,333,367,299,301,317,219,269,327,328,329,330,463,490,496,518,316,481,31,489,218,28,389,337,464,519,461],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This method is simpler and faster, making it suitable for quick scans or when high-speed processing is necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, \"True Gray\" uses up to 256 shades of gray, providing a more accurate and detailed representation of the original image. This method is more complex and requires more memory and processing time, but it results in a higher quality scan with better color accuracy and finer detail.\n\nYou might choose \"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" when you need to scan quickly or when the image quality is not critical, such as for preliminary drafts or when scanning documents that will not be printed in high resolution. \"True Gray,\" however, is ideal for high-quality scans that will be printed or used in detailed applications, such as graphic design or professional printing, where color accuracy and fine detail are essential.","source":"data/test/mfcj1010dw.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,118,24,383,161,141,82,56,111,234,277,505,513,77,386,515,529,378,514,107,165,385,526,377,510,65,166,418,143,349,387,503,92,528,17,123,124,214,274,498,120,159,182,197,275,502,86,127,128,142,149,160,280,3,117,388,4,81,158,169,382,411,496,49,50,121,233,276,278,417,426,485,494,517,520,55,89,136,151,155,164,195,215,231,236,264,493,5,16,22,75,97,153,415,431,459,506,507,512,57,66,103,126,183,223,249,279,491,40,61,64,162,372,406,419,486,500,516,47,62,134,167,184,188,229,288,289,373,414,509,76,115,148,232,408,413,416,464,83,104,163,219,310,438,452,457,21,60,70,84,98,133,146,171,194,209,216,324,325,337,465,54,87,106,145,156,176,208,210,230,356,410,412,443,501,52,137,150,152,217,235,323,379,384,425,2,100,101,112,226,371,374,375,407,497,30,36,73,129,154,221,333,340,381,132,168,174,193,440,531,45,131,139,173,261,287,293,298,331,339,353,391,395,461,51,135,172,181,196,220,250,314,336,362,364,467,15,29,116,130,178,192,199,206,228,237,312,319,330,370,432,476,484,27,41,71,88,224,296,302,95,211,358,508,147,175,186,222,246,332,390,455,492,53,113,424,489,63,357,376,428,472,10,140,225,254,458,483,204,218,309,499,533,8,28,108,138,187,198,511,532,144,202,347,389,474,13,23,227,259,271,338,380,430,456,14,91,96,125,170,180,207,240,300,316,43,201,213,238,404,478,487,504,79,105,157,311,352,519,69,252,255,318,401,530,109,272,527,67,286,317,421,466,475,74,177,313,355,479,521,524,68,94,102,212,409,436,39,93,114,203,245,335,346,453,345,420,477,495,248,256,268,334,348,403,6,37,185,267,304,429,445,523,20,31,190,263,451,482,46,48,90,327,396,400,299,363,392,35,244,292,295,518,9,189,251,283,427,26,44,72,191,243,284,308,322,473,19,481,38,488,80,241,257,365,460,18,239,42,58,290,326,361,297,301,315,423,522,260,285,422,25,99,359,450,179,394,397,398,12,266,306,367,242,303,328,329,368,110,307,354,369,393,434,447,282,405,534,32,200,462,433,446,253,435,439,442,33,281,471,270,344,490,366,448,78,351,525,59,468,7,294,341,1,321,463,85,205,470,11,305,449,122,342,343,291,399,437,441,258,34,265,360,320,350,273,262,402,454,247,444,535,269,469,480],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This allows the driver to easily monitor the system's status and make any necessary adjustments as needed.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[530,533,134,139,166,167,135,537,111,531,391,532,113,33,504,112,536,770,534,535,222,605,443,48,555,49,20,170,476,511,561,19,213,393,10,34,165,212,214,509,574,470,216,556,161,437,575,159,160,501,542,122,162,477,599,141,454,563,643,71,201,129,521,527,17,101,123,420,466,522,622,157,471,168,92,117,625,685,734,441,502,507,729,126,127,154,580,164,481,591,259,267,486,629,108,482,485,118,128,179,264,328,540,721,104,155,169,356,490,500,632,645,705,116,188,377,462,492,268,474,526,631,728,140,313,317,137,178,512,618,120,131,276,461,541,578,628,719,183,320,378,467,560,581,637,655,254,321,392,403,424,425,439,460,469,480,495,508,682,37,114,153,156,209,257,478,483,516,525,570,766,105,142,152,196,207,329,390,515,520,577,593,710,274,423,601,636,769,115,243,255,294,472,506,524,565,592,644,660,768,15,29,30,56,93,121,136,147,163,262,263,279,318,452,519,667,737,12,89,150,208,311,347,491,151,158,236,389,468,489,493,514,548,564,587,28,61,171,314,497,510,554,630,24,36,45,81,143,319,382,458,463,544,584,597,652,686,713,733,145,195,242,250,394,453,499,539,558,609,611,646,765,27,76,77,138,335,348,590,624,664,771,62,97,102,404,455,457,528,588,596,627,676,744,764,8,73,119,144,149,286,309,324,327,517,546,582,610,614,22,83,91,96,107,330,473,600,651,72,124,246,353,479,488,503,518,567,594,702,732,767,244,315,523,551,606,647,677,748,38,82,100,205,241,283,384,431,459,487,543,706,731,99,109,125,148,186,200,211,270,280,341,545,626,648,722,755,69,249,275,316,464,573,688,704,743,60,94,293,310,409,450,484,615,634,640,691,707,736,67,110,130,221,289,292,350,379,396,401,446,494,529,579,663,712,716,726,756,174,177,181,193,199,247,307,397,400,465,557,623,730,739,95,133,187,190,204,297,363,538,559,583,585,607,717,16,26,78,202,210,239,248,278,281,421,505,550,641,53,106,227,237,245,269,288,323,399,498,612,619,654,4,32,64,74,85,87,132,189,228,235,253,282,340,388,407,422,440,613,703,25,31,43,146,180,322,408,549,562,602,608,642,750,9,75,306,349,427,435,715,2,50,198,295,305,338,351,436,475,595,604,697,723,745,18,23,88,173,220,287,308,336,405,456,496,569,576,586,620,695,738,740,773,57,59,80,172,203,285,395,708,735,65,197,251,325,331,447,451,635,711,718,720,84,98,215,343,438,513,589,621,687,58,192,252,303,312,339,361,417,566,725,754,21,39,234,273,284,352,406,568,598,617,675,751,14,42,47,194,218,256,271,333,444,633,649,681,683,742,55,86,206,217,219,238,240,334,414,547,669,689,701,224,296,298,301,344,418,433,616,653,772,11,46,226,231,291,304,326,412,449,603,694,741,7,70,184,229,290,332,650,656,673,749,63,66,191,258,266,387,552,553,13,41,51,103,230,233,380,398,402,571,692,79,277,360,415,639,668,693,699,752,68,232,302,337,364,383,428,670,35,432,445,657,690,700,1,5,265,662,714,747,175,225,680,182,355,419,684,724,6,223,371,411,661,762,261,362,410,430,659,709,185,366,370,416,429,434,658,572,666,3,44,176,346,367,698,727,260,272,300,342,426,672,760,365,671,674,679,757,54,358,368,448,678,357,372,665,381,354,753,374,52,299,369,413,345,385,759,386,758,375,359,376,373,638,763,40,696,761,90,442,746],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1}]}
{"question":"What potential safety concern could arise if the trunk opener is accidentally activated while driving, and how might this relate to the vehicle's design?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[189],"raw_output":"","pred":"The trunk opener, located on the driver's door, could potentially pose a safety concern if accidentally activated while driving. While the text mentions that the trunk opener is designed to be activated only when the vehicle is stationary, there is a risk of unintended activation during driving.\n\nThis concern relates to the vehicle's design in a few key ways:\n\n1. The trunk opener is located on the driver's door, which is easily accessible while driving. This makes it a tempting target for accidental activation.\n\n2. The trunk opener is designed to be activated by pressing and holding the button. This could be done inadvertently by the driver or passenger while adjusting their position or reaching for something.\n\n3. The trunk opener is intended to be used only when the vehicle is stationary. However, if the driver is not fully aware of this limitation, they could activate it while driving, potentially causing the trunk to open unexpectedly.\n\n4. The trunk opener is part of the vehicle's security system, which is designed to be activated when the vehicle is locked. This could lead to confusion if the driver is not aware that the trunk opener is part of the security system.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the vehicle's design should include clear instructions on the trunk opener's proper use and limitations. Additionally, the trunk opener should be designed with a more secure activation mechanism that requires deliberate action, rather than a simple press-and-hold button.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[189,193,88,12,45,47,713,23,221,191,76,454,399,116,452,490,525,634,174,453,82,83,178,192,507,599,766,43,184,190,476,519,524,614,618,627,89,176,179,460,613,745,710,715,743,180,198,620,628,716,9,38,195,239,457,462,470,539,77,492,508,530,641,688,46,471,500,511,529,561,655,744,765,37,177,201,207,209,215,356,445,477,515,520,629,363,458,509,683,724,728,36,81,112,450,491,555,704,769,8,468,472,478,537,540,581,637,697,705,171,196,216,465,687,771,51,75,80,444,526,532,672,14,33,39,242,245,275,528,720,731,42,50,78,479,480,517,681,2,56,98,102,105,154,236,241,435,474,494,590,663,695,722,732,742,34,238,274,330,463,473,475,574,633,691,739,96,204,229,251,259,518,521,538,612,660,685,694,706,725,729,73,93,99,106,108,218,223,447,501,523,578,621,622,675,702,768,48,49,71,111,212,227,286,459,466,502,503,560,575,632,31,57,115,203,222,237,279,439,469,516,531,559,605,606,609,615,700,723,734,735,767,113,181,183,194,199,244,253,270,400,404,527,548,549,585,607,610,616,619,642,667,740,770,18,53,61,69,87,94,97,187,231,335,401,455,461,536,567,593,608,611,631,650,699,730,737,74,103,104,143,200,210,220,224,243,314,347,353,449,451,506,522,556,577,601,626,649,658,709,719,22,127,219,225,235,325,425,557,565,584,589,592,635,664,693,754,16,52,197,396,456,533,569,573,598,624,668,15,59,62,66,86,95,160,202,228,339,437,446,467,495,498,499,544,580,583,726,733,5,30,85,92,110,128,161,248,348,440,443,493,497,510,513,550,568,673,714,748,755,756,7,10,107,109,166,234,328,331,355,405,422,482,535,639,640,659,662,689,60,67,101,313,402,441,504,554,596,602,603,711,750,17,24,54,55,58,142,155,182,205,208,240,340,407,486,512,579,582,591,647,657,692,703,721,35,41,44,79,100,129,134,162,185,211,280,282,427,431,563,651,686,712,747,762,63,72,121,169,186,188,324,341,542,562,576,586,594,623,764,21,65,117,175,297,309,343,350,370,394,403,483,543,570,588,595,630,643,701,708,717,4,29,32,139,281,292,305,364,393,464,481,484,505,547,564,644,698,727,84,278,600,684,25,126,213,214,249,277,349,636,665,690,752,757,68,333,426,432,545,566,114,120,334,417,448,587,604,13,255,306,357,485,707,170,271,423,496,514,666,760,6,27,137,141,164,206,252,276,283,534,625,736,741,140,168,217,377,420,424,656,159,254,268,327,329,408,546,654,759,20,70,118,131,246,263,391,395,414,153,354,438,541,551,597,676,144,148,267,326,617,165,250,303,352,374,409,558,572,680,138,304,390,429,488,652,679,19,167,226,264,298,552,645,653,671,718,40,247,338,346,489,682,753,262,362,436,487,669,758,91,132,285,337,389,661,28,152,289,296,315,382,442,738,119,147,172,230,293,307,332,342,367,380,383,398,406,412,11,90,123,257,295,670,751,3,151,232,320,360,366,421,571,150,156,233,319,371,387,392,284,291,299,323,358,369,411,157,317,345,379,419,677,746,135,301,310,434,553,638,646,674,258,272,26,133,378,433,749,136,149,163,410,415,648,772,64,428,311,361,418,696,158,318,321,678,124,294,302,336,368,122,273,308,416,761,773,125,265,269,365,130,146,288,381,385,397,344,384,430,145,256,413,1,173,359,351,763,260,287,261,372,373,266,316,290,322,388,376,300,375,312,386],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Strong radio waves from nearby equipment: The table states that \"Strong radio waves are being transmitted by nearby equipment\" can inhibit or destabilize communication between the keyless remote and the vehicle.\n\n2. Carrying the keyless remote with other electronic devices: The table notes that \"You are carrying the keyless remote together with telecommunications equipment, laptop computers, cell phones, or wireless devices\" can also negatively impact signal strength.\n\n3. Metallic objects touching or covering the keyless remote: The table mentions that \"A metallic object is touching or covering the keyless remote\" can prevent the remote from effectively communicating with the vehicle.\n\nThese factors suggest that electronic devices, strong radio signals, and physical obstructions can all interfere with the keyless remote's ability to transmit signals to the vehicle, potentially preventing it from starting the engine, locking/unlocking doors, or opening the trunk. The table also indicates that these issues may be more pronounced on certain models, though it doesn't specify which ones.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,184,199,450,451,180,190,721,183,452,454,719,178,201,171,38,192,179,769,196,177,182,239,198,687,175,193,455,174,453,697,200,396,181,143,356,634,503,363,727,404,439,43,628,401,424,142,194,205,399,772,422,514,768,9,23,237,537,195,601,618,602,605,770,238,263,394,445,460,462,549,568,311,457,633,685,71,236,499,529,710,744,75,209,241,251,339,523,526,567,600,607,732,37,39,76,297,313,374,444,465,491,500,528,530,531,598,603,622,639,695,725,731,106,116,129,162,342,432,446,478,651,3,207,223,242,309,402,407,472,519,536,548,599,756,2,62,77,220,250,253,427,521,578,589,608,641,681,686,689,713,22,46,197,210,281,306,425,476,493,524,612,656,742,745,764,7,208,222,240,270,355,360,468,513,532,574,606,613,728,735,766,771,29,47,52,56,74,89,286,330,364,400,414,520,525,590,611,620,675,691,706,726,45,48,68,113,212,262,276,352,354,458,470,498,501,507,512,683,729,42,60,66,72,203,346,350,435,463,490,492,515,587,665,694,716,723,765,54,65,88,98,221,259,348,412,466,555,586,614,640,660,688,722,36,59,204,243,246,249,275,277,325,340,406,440,594,595,629,663,720,740,33,49,50,51,58,166,254,341,405,480,539,540,544,579,636,655,662,666,692,714,733,31,57,104,141,317,334,344,349,362,417,436,441,494,585,593,610,627,754,5,8,61,97,100,101,111,188,244,274,336,357,418,535,560,626,699,11,34,35,63,80,81,92,93,102,115,189,191,202,213,215,218,235,282,345,351,474,516,517,522,631,650,690,753,99,105,108,245,280,337,338,367,403,423,447,504,559,730,69,73,95,103,147,155,187,257,258,271,332,333,343,416,420,426,431,433,437,438,459,461,511,534,561,565,596,724,743,758,767,26,256,361,398,550,581,592,609,623,625,635,637,711,21,25,30,82,387,430,443,477,527,664,693,32,225,314,377,428,508,518,556,667,86,96,145,211,285,320,321,464,538,734,14,125,273,283,365,408,471,569,704,715,755,759,83,206,409,421,547,588,702,739,15,67,78,112,123,127,224,411,543,545,619,53,107,310,456,615,680,705,18,134,227,229,307,347,415,429,533,564,573,647,128,216,248,331,371,410,413,576,616,709,747,159,278,295,475,575,584,649,44,79,137,255,279,632,679,335,382,434,467,469,643,677,707,757,16,154,370,380,381,558,186,214,294,366,368,473,510,644,673,703,717,737,109,157,217,292,392,419,479,485,580,604,668,736,4,247,316,324,393,448,566,748,10,27,94,135,167,353,488,583,597,110,160,161,305,509,542,773,17,87,117,298,304,551,557,642,657,762,231,272,328,506,684,12,119,164,252,481,570,138,288,293,326,487,502,630,652,674,41,131,132,168,301,329,358,373,140,266,299,319,378,483,496,554,563,582,760,126,153,264,269,289,296,379,384,391,497,149,226,359,449,659,669,741,6,139,233,234,383,624,712,120,185,390,148,267,284,486,621,750,303,327,591,708,28,85,505,701,24,219,369,553,700,156,232,287,291,318,676,55,118,133,136,150,312,315,386,752,114,122,385,388,389,484,670,121,169,395,482,84,90,322,572,577,19,20,268,302,323,397,617,144,228,495,638,672,682,761,146,151,230,489,546,648,13,40,124,265,571,170,172,442,552,671,165,541,70,152,260,308,696,698,738,372,261,678,718,751,646,658,91,746,376,653,130,290,173,749,1,300,562,645,654,64,763,163,375,661,158],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

For the smaller print, use a smaller paper size, and for the larger print, use a larger paper size.\n5. **Print the Document**: Click the Print button to send the document to the printer.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage the print settings to achieve the desired layout and proportions for your document, including the pie chart, on different sheets of paper.","source":"data/test/workforce_pro_wf4830_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[68,284,50,76,40,75,48,64,46,47,65,41,67,87,69,58,212,55,117,38,49,66,56,214,60,85,211,44,57,39,219,111,223,123,86,52,54,210,314,27,124,45,81,277,63,74,82,220,121,209,118,225,53,70,205,213,311,42,181,218,276,28,216,8,154,285,291,37,149,51,83,84,162,202,208,200,224,228,2,29,259,59,91,148,94,108,120,147,315,341,122,260,350,43,130,329,73,203,263,22,100,283,23,112,222,26,61,77,97,106,221,227,261,298,72,229,249,32,71,93,199,238,316,328,6,35,204,215,248,267,290,322,323,18,266,286,339,3,62,178,333,80,99,256,270,289,310,325,358,362,194,279,331,353,24,98,166,183,288,312,334,337,342,354,30,110,116,179,262,281,330,336,1,78,90,92,109,127,133,165,193,217,321,324,344,4,5,157,159,195,245,287,355,190,268,278,292,313,326,96,115,128,145,152,197,332,335,338,351,359,105,129,132,172,206,244,343,352,363,36,198,226,241,327,182,345,14,21,33,95,177,207,305,317,340,348,367,131,237,240,251,275,114,119,253,257,365,15,20,34,101,142,155,185,196,201,231,252,293,349,366,12,138,176,233,250,271,274,282,309,347,381,156,169,184,247,346,370,380,126,186,230,258,299,300,139,163,235,239,265,360,368,372,25,31,125,135,137,160,168,180,269,371,376,7,17,146,255,318,13,151,189,356,79,89,102,191,296,301,136,173,272,280,319,382,104,141,153,254,307,164,187,234,242,246,16,144,297,308,320,357,364,375,88,134,243,273,304,361,374,143,161,306,378,107,150,167,170,192,383,174,175,188,373,140,158,113,171,232,236,264,377,11,103,303,295,369,379,10,19,294,302,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This helps maintain the optimal humidity levels for these vegetables. Additionally, individual weights should be considered when placing vegetables; heavier and harder vegetables should be placed at the bottom, while lighter and softer vegetables should be placed on top. This arrangement helps distribute the weight evenly and prevents the heavier vegetables from squashing the lighter ones.\n\nIt is also important to avoid storing vegetables in their original bags, as this can cause premature decomposition. Instead, use perforated paper bags or similar materials to keep the vegetables separate. This allows for better air circulation and prevents moisture buildup.\n\nRegarding fruits, certain fruits like pears, apricots, peaches, and apples generate high levels of ethylene gas. Ethylene gas can accelerate the ripening process and cause other fruits and vegetables to decompose faster. Therefore, it is recommended not to store these fruits with other fruits and vegetables that do not produce ethylene gas.

It simplifies the process of tracking and managing a large number of images, especially when images are transferred to a computer.\n\nHowever, a potential disadvantage of continuous numbering is that it can lead to file number overflow, where the maximum file number (9999) is reached. This can be problematic if the camera is used extensively over a long period, as it may require frequent card changes or folder creation to continue numbering.\n\nIn contrast, Auto reset and Manual reset methods restart the file numbering from 0001 each time a new card is inserted or a new folder is created. This prevents file number overflow and ensures that each new set of images starts from a fresh numbering sequence. This is particularly useful for organizing images by different projects or dates, as it allows for clear separation between sets of images.\n\nThe Auto reset method is convenient for automatic organization, while the Manual reset method provides more control, allowing the user to start a new numbering sequence at a specific point. Both methods avoid the complexity of continuous numbering in scenarios where multiple cards or folders are used, but they require more frequent card changes or folder creation.","source":"data/test/eos_4000d.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[186,295,187,278,316,193,52,184,297,318,269,12,181,195,15,17,65,185,288,315,117,290,2,10,285,87,242,317,73,118,252,134,271,171,319,138,180,100,167,230,245,250,273,235,28,248,289,53,101,174,112,202,5,39,261,283,292,66,40,194,277,280,299,38,50,74,154,213,237,279,298,13,88,142,149,166,221,85,96,182,220,259,89,90,145,161,162,165,170,222,249,169,175,286,139,207,268,11,57,61,71,179,198,211,217,253,282,47,158,209,251,8,103,146,173,176,218,246,272,276,284,48,55,60,83,92,99,133,231,239,243,263,287,6,59,79,131,140,212,215,227,16,63,148,155,188,229,264,18,19,24,54,86,121,168,190,226,254,293,41,192,256,296,91,97,128,143,160,214,219,244,281,37,68,111,113,123,191,203,223,225,241,294,30,44,104,163,201,260,313,98,216,228,234,257,258,14,51,70,115,156,196,210,233,265,314,36,64,95,159,164,178,200,247,304,34,130,135,152,183,58,110,147,310,4,62,69,72,75,109,116,172,206,270,275,300,35,42,67,114,122,151,199,208,23,76,189,80,94,127,144,150,224,312,7,9,21,49,129,141,153,157,236,240,20,25,197,262,27,204,320,1,93,124,321,82,45,102,108,177,255,29,132,301,303,126,205,238,77,78,119,307,291,322,106,107,308,137,302,309,3,232,56,136,266,22,43,84,305,81,105,306,120,267,311,46,32,125,274,26,31,33],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

By removing and reinserting the cartridges, the user can troubleshoot and potentially resolve the error without needing to contact customer support.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[538,531,454,110,101,104,103,532,157,461,105,462,111,147,513,528,116,524,117,274,455,102,463,176,523,407,246,512,520,129,267,275,113,2,476,529,3,100,154,530,94,484,74,527,245,541,493,148,469,542,204,501,107,519,118,465,457,508,123,84,526,392,504,540,334,472,503,93,466,525,115,165,426,92,332,96,128,161,330,481,510,514,114,124,146,163,220,227,324,344,458,536,81,86,106,109,121,149,215,280,382,518,535,55,77,182,244,511,119,219,338,447,516,517,533,78,85,277,397,402,418,467,502,515,60,82,91,172,174,231,282,329,333,366,391,401,403,415,434,439,448,459,470,507,69,228,233,341,367,405,122,351,410,33,37,42,43,50,160,191,237,240,276,398,423,443,521,539,156,158,194,320,374,384,408,437,488,509,39,97,364,378,57,65,87,189,225,226,243,247,395,177,416,480,494,4,41,442,456,537,120,175,203,218,259,386,389,390,451,66,108,188,200,201,239,293,365,383,400,435,446,452,477,63,79,162,173,235,473,40,76,89,150,153,179,328,336,350,464,309,339,359,424,75,83,183,236,294,323,436,441,490,266,368,431,440,47,112,325,353,393,413,181,283,331,346,167,184,281,375,379,394,429,44,199,234,250,343,131,132,295,326,9,64,68,342,362,444,8,46,53,127,164,358,369,433,491,505,59,67,263,303,310,419,422,438,453,468,58,80,159,166,229,356,412,460,497,522,248,354,361,414,54,70,169,187,288,411,61,62,256,432,486,7,257,380,385,399,499,178,193,298,370,372,196,271,314,345,406,136,327,450,471,45,168,273,302,311,272,284,304,337,357,186,241,306,318,474,506,534,212,255,377,125,197,258,296,297,312,315,388,500,198,253,307,316,396,260,498,48,137,348,371,5,133,185,217,232,262,363,427,482,49,130,144,180,190,213,301,340,475,56,352,376,209,221,264,387,95,143,230,238,409,483,487,142,251,254,285,373,425,11,13,51,52,134,242,299,319,347,381,489,35,38,90,135,141,265,349,420,421,36,99,138,140,252,287,6,139,192,223,270,286,291,321,322,335,355,211,10,261,292,300,445,170,210,417,98,222,428,73,289,317,449,478,479,495,496,360,206,290,485,26,71,151,155,152,195,202,214,269,27,126,268,308,16,249,492,171,208,17,12,29,313,31,14,279,24,88,305,430,34,30,32,72,25,20,23,278,224,216,404,19,205,18,145,207,21,22,1,28,15],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"What is the maximum number of legal-sized plain paper sheets that can be loaded into the paper output tray, and how does this compare to the capacity for standard plain paper sheets?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[212],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the information provided in the target table, the maximum number of legal-sized plain paper sheets that can be loaded into the paper output tray is 10 sheets. This is significantly lower than the capacity for standard plain paper sheets, which is approximately 50 sheets.\n\nThe table shows two types of plain paper:\n\n1. Plain Paper (including recycled paper): Approx. 50 sheets\n2. Legal-sized plain paper: 10 sheets\n\nThis indicates that while standard plain paper can be loaded in larger quantities (50 sheets), legal-sized plain paper has a much more limited capacity of only 10 sheets. The difference in capacity likely reflects the physical dimensions and design of legal-sized paper, which may not fit as efficiently in the paper output tray as standard letter-sized paper.\n\nThe lower capacity for legal-sized paper suggests that users should be more cautious when loading this type of paper to avoid overloading the tray and potentially causing paper jams or other printing issues. It also implies that users may need to load legal-sized paper more frequently compared to standard paper to maintain an adequate supply in the output tray.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[212,153,513,122,456,98,211,509,210,519,400,535,79,517,2,501,121,113,117,510,75,233,280,33,83,514,87,260,4,508,154,173,262,85,229,405,231,469,76,203,205,256,408,275,93,465,218,225,281,533,82,458,502,518,78,226,406,223,286,89,198,222,235,484,221,228,285,105,209,261,263,80,467,534,81,86,245,410,174,219,220,267,77,208,507,3,252,398,463,97,237,74,129,227,271,234,239,250,325,389,466,283,324,176,461,95,253,531,189,213,323,411,183,295,92,224,240,392,468,90,204,264,359,451,5,120,247,255,382,378,522,94,102,215,251,254,532,123,454,511,8,399,9,265,266,321,521,314,515,236,270,308,416,457,464,472,88,230,284,145,147,148,197,214,372,415,506,520,96,106,185,294,375,99,315,450,101,430,536,84,137,169,379,432,258,357,512,144,206,293,377,481,91,149,351,374,488,7,125,158,168,296,471,516,268,300,384,452,34,246,346,480,35,108,320,352,407,542,119,127,175,186,390,42,100,150,172,269,273,470,25,157,192,282,303,459,504,112,347,354,424,439,473,529,538,10,27,151,232,302,61,156,194,257,292,373,6,289,449,530,38,107,309,349,478,483,36,104,135,160,259,386,436,437,55,316,429,460,17,187,200,14,65,448,114,244,291,362,383,19,110,341,248,16,56,68,181,523,32,37,73,306,370,526,528,139,438,23,39,70,272,401,446,116,162,242,287,307,363,442,28,44,62,159,188,274,342,539,30,31,40,191,290,299,317,20,297,312,343,525,537,18,141,184,15,118,318,330,397,462,494,24,131,217,360,46,171,387,447,503,67,412,455,493,524,21,22,138,195,353,403,26,497,45,111,170,180,278,279,344,395,193,319,402,440,476,541,52,199,298,332,333,12,143,310,340,366,58,109,238,326,331,348,350,165,190,313,428,29,64,103,132,146,161,496,49,140,179,277,369,51,57,367,368,385,409,426,477,482,41,115,311,418,53,72,124,130,152,336,380,394,489,126,419,444,490,540,43,63,134,329,364,479,128,339,433,66,388,47,133,288,322,396,431,498,166,182,201,334,505,13,249,337,423,48,164,177,304,391,434,1,11,136,422,196,356,365,371,167,216,417,500,54,361,71,155,163,441,243,327,335,276,393,413,202,305,435,50,59,142,345,358,355,495,474,69,376,443,486,178,60,301,338,453,207,414,420,499,527,381,328,475,491,445,425,487,241,485,421,427,492,404],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What are the potential issues you might encounter if you attempt to scan a set of 25 A4-sized documents with varying thicknesses and weights using the ADF, and how can you mitigate these issues?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[98],"raw_output":"","pred":"Scanning a set of 25 A4-sized documents with varying thicknesses and weights using the ADF can lead to several issues. Firstly, the ADF is designed to handle documents of the same size and thickness. If the documents vary in thickness, the ADF might struggle to feed them correctly, leading to misfeeds or jams. Secondly, documents with different weights can affect the scanning process, potentially causing the scanner to misalign or misread the documents. This can result in poor image quality or incomplete scans.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Uniform Document Size and Weight**: Ensure all documents are of the same size and weight. This will help the ADF feed them more smoothly and reduce the risk of misfeeds or jams.\n\n2. **Manual Scanning**: If the documents cannot be made uniform, consider scanning them manually. This involves placing each document individually on the platen and scanning it one by one. This method provides better control over the scanning process and ensures that each document is scanned correctly.\n\n3. **Use of a Flatbed Scanner**: If the ADF is not suitable for the task, a flatbed scanner can be a better option. Flatbed scanners are designed to handle a variety of document sizes and weights, providing more flexibility and better image quality.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can ensure a more efficient and effective scanning process, even with documents of varying thicknesses and weights.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[293,320,467,154,302,89,374,93,98,463,324,284,481,375,323,295,306,307,283,378,120,186,319,119,303,3,205,88,314,158,507,173,510,514,518,266,436,456,471,535,261,437,508,309,226,332,8,446,459,461,488,247,464,493,117,235,317,458,473,477,321,415,482,536,121,416,452,503,33,99,189,229,285,294,79,118,429,534,230,47,97,109,156,329,424,213,264,292,331,417,438,466,476,252,296,308,395,465,480,7,218,281,325,382,470,472,501,529,95,233,237,435,451,502,85,194,225,236,262,316,384,445,469,115,227,290,299,311,398,450,495,511,538,9,394,418,419,432,66,80,122,263,300,475,484,136,231,265,301,57,96,116,123,127,129,153,228,315,389,405,457,77,111,219,251,377,439,530,533,6,49,81,94,110,113,132,135,312,448,53,84,107,167,187,196,197,260,289,422,460,486,490,504,44,112,130,150,200,240,431,92,101,114,131,138,204,273,286,298,381,392,408,489,506,5,91,166,201,203,212,255,310,341,379,410,447,455,83,157,184,191,193,214,220,234,361,474,496,36,259,390,468,519,174,239,277,297,318,333,391,400,513,25,40,41,63,108,146,210,224,253,343,385,433,542,38,45,58,65,67,185,280,282,313,326,336,403,423,426,453,487,524,42,68,106,245,279,388,406,407,434,512,134,137,211,257,288,291,327,412,497,528,531,540,541,69,70,141,165,199,223,248,334,387,449,494,2,43,76,164,192,271,359,411,454,500,505,90,133,162,243,250,287,305,414,478,479,485,532,35,62,86,102,149,209,349,527,4,16,87,181,198,244,328,393,441,509,39,46,60,125,148,206,344,350,353,368,420,443,491,516,521,56,74,100,139,142,143,144,159,178,183,217,256,258,342,462,515,23,27,54,232,354,362,537,50,160,161,177,215,216,274,380,401,64,147,169,242,267,339,383,425,440,483,14,17,59,128,140,175,241,269,270,275,356,428,499,19,55,145,182,346,367,369,386,498,523,26,30,104,172,176,179,208,254,335,352,365,402,427,442,21,52,171,190,304,340,364,525,29,105,168,337,363,366,370,421,444,492,526,539,10,34,48,78,357,396,15,37,82,188,272,351,413,520,517,20,268,322,345,28,152,360,373,399,522,358,31,222,404,376,24,124,249,371,12,348,18,75,180,32,71,22,221,338,372,330,72,246,151,276,73,195,163,207,278,61,170,51,238,347,355,103,13,202,1,430,11,155,409,397,126],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This will disable the function that detects the level of ink remaining in the ink cartridge. This allows you to continue printing or copying until the remaining ink is depleted.\n\n2. **Continue Printing or Copying**: With the ink level detection function disabled, you can continue printing or copying. However, please note that the image quality may be diminished if you print or copy when there is little ink remaining in the cartridge(s).\n\n3. **Prepare for Future Printing**: Ensure that you have a new ink cartridge available as soon as possible to avoid further interruptions in your printing or copying tasks.\n\nBy following these steps, you can temporarily resume your printing or copying activities without a new ink cartridge, but it is recommended to replace the ink cartridge as soon as possible for optimal image quality.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[529,530,476,526,527,525,531,524,528,116,107,461,538,501,523,454,463,455,484,101,111,462,103,123,458,520,532,113,542,110,117,507,157,176,508,472,518,522,533,535,540,457,504,519,121,284,446,510,537,541,115,147,407,419,451,453,521,100,104,246,450,490,439,452,465,467,513,3,464,468,473,503,511,105,108,149,245,275,395,405,426,493,506,392,497,512,422,434,456,477,92,109,187,274,281,283,416,424,514,4,74,94,148,237,382,41,102,165,179,385,423,480,488,2,47,397,431,37,79,82,119,164,172,327,408,410,438,444,466,470,481,515,122,160,244,368,398,415,418,437,447,486,536,8,78,118,173,174,189,293,394,412,441,445,448,83,87,106,127,129,161,218,226,384,432,9,40,180,280,296,320,326,417,440,516,46,76,86,112,240,247,378,388,469,517,39,65,158,219,235,328,460,534,43,50,80,84,144,150,167,177,429,491,494,509,44,114,124,196,204,295,329,337,366,435,436,502,45,54,131,184,200,209,229,236,276,375,390,33,42,53,55,69,212,266,267,338,344,400,433,443,471,70,128,156,163,220,225,243,273,277,331,332,336,359,403,411,413,483,498,5,154,162,166,188,198,201,233,298,325,389,421,505,7,85,182,239,294,350,355,361,62,68,175,178,186,194,199,215,227,248,253,256,282,303,369,380,57,63,191,214,285,304,341,372,374,377,401,459,48,159,232,333,346,358,420,500,539,125,197,288,352,353,428,58,230,259,299,349,414,56,66,81,153,190,203,278,286,301,309,313,364,367,376,396,487,60,91,183,210,302,310,316,330,371,406,475,479,89,93,96,168,181,238,254,255,265,307,321,351,370,391,442,77,228,231,250,260,272,319,356,482,496,38,59,64,216,251,287,297,318,339,386,478,495,120,132,211,213,217,242,263,342,357,363,449,489,143,252,257,279,291,6,207,208,234,323,373,383,402,61,95,146,334,347,387,409,49,51,90,192,223,241,261,262,271,289,322,379,72,171,185,193,258,13,99,249,311,317,343,360,67,221,425,75,264,345,362,312,315,354,427,485,52,202,222,340,348,430,10,224,365,381,474,492,499,306,335,399,133,155,290,308,314,324,88,97,270,98,138,145,206,35,142,195,169,170,268,1,130,205,292,36,126,136,300,404,134,137,393,14,73,11,27,269,16,17,25,141,305,12,152,34,151,20,26,135,139,71,140,28,32,30,19,29,24,21,22,23,15,18,31],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

If the interference stops when the camera is turned off, it confirms that the camera is the source of the interference.\n\n2. **Reorient or Relocate the Receiving Antenna**: If the interference persists, reorienting or relocating the receiving antenna can help mitigate the issue. This might involve moving the antenna to a different position or using a different antenna altogether.\n\n3. **Increase the Separation Between the Camera and Receiver**: Moving the camera further away from the receiver can reduce the interference. This is because the strength of the interference decreases with distance.\n\n4. **Connect the Camera to an Outlet on a Different Circuit**: This can help isolate the interference issue by ensuring that the camera is not drawing power from the same circuit as the receiver.\n\n5. **Consult the Dealer or an Experienced Technician**: If the interference continues despite these steps, it is advisable to consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician. They can provide professional advice and potentially identify any underlying issues with the camera or the receiver.\n\nFollowing these steps is crucial because it helps to identify and mitigate the interference, ensuring that the camera can be used without disrupting radio or television reception. This prevents potential legal issues and ensures the safe and effective use of both the camera and the electronic devices in the vicinity.","source":"data/test/x100vi.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[384,385,383,386,401,273,381,380,84,65,269,69,76,274,333,275,382,268,276,196,388,64,66,262,67,81,99,100,191,281,68,85,279,287,356,253,277,408,72,77,136,395,282,393,402,203,387,389,89,289,358,392,400,34,391,75,164,291,70,98,138,139,244,135,200,272,290,14,73,114,302,119,130,140,261,303,327,361,407,91,133,378,399,21,50,74,82,122,134,255,258,288,299,344,379,403,80,105,108,142,298,398,88,131,360,406,53,93,94,266,280,300,310,357,405,167,174,176,340,375,35,110,127,192,219,283,397,2,31,41,49,199,214,32,90,129,163,193,245,296,396,9,13,22,102,254,270,278,350,352,28,45,62,86,96,101,103,162,178,187,294,312,338,404,3,55,57,83,112,117,231,284,285,306,5,27,39,58,128,194,217,249,257,316,343,36,157,166,172,248,250,251,256,267,304,325,328,339,416,4,38,40,42,183,195,198,206,359,369,59,168,180,230,263,295,305,6,11,25,30,47,210,224,242,259,292,366,390,43,48,106,121,197,221,226,232,241,334,353,373,376,377,394,7,12,15,18,19,71,111,113,125,149,165,169,186,204,227,286,311,331,20,24,54,92,109,215,236,347,123,143,144,177,185,228,229,260,309,317,349,354,413,46,52,115,156,188,207,240,314,326,409,8,17,51,107,126,132,155,173,189,208,225,324,346,348,362,10,56,161,234,313,332,365,37,60,104,120,171,184,190,319,345,16,33,137,179,181,182,202,321,372,415,420,44,95,97,141,243,26,61,116,158,205,239,363,368,370,160,211,235,271,318,329,335,342,410,418,419,124,330,351,63,209,159,216,246,307,315,320,364,118,201,233,341,223,301,367,264,323,78,87,212,23,175,1,147,218,293,213,247,374,411,148,220,252,153,222,355,170,322,308,336,146,152,412,414,154,238,151,29,417,150,297,145,265,337,79,371,237],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Real-time communication: Unlike traditional text messaging, RTT allows you to send and receive messages in real-time while on a call. This means you can type and send messages as you talk, and the recipient can read them immediately.\n\n2. Simultaneous communication: RTT enables both parties to communicate simultaneously during a call. You can type messages while the other person is speaking, and vice versa.\n\n3. Call minutes: RTT uses call minutes just like a regular voice call, whereas traditional text messaging doesn't consume call time.\n\n4. No additional accessories: RTT doesn't require any special accessories, making it more convenient to use during calls compared to traditional text messaging.\n\n5. Visibility of messages: The text you type is visible to the other person as you type, allowing for immediate feedback and conversation.\n\n6. Accessibility: RTT is designed to be accessible for people with hearing impairments or other communication challenges, making it a valuable tool for those who need real-time text communication during calls.\n\nThese differences make RTT particularly useful for scenarios where immediate, real-time communication is crucial, such as emergency calls or conversations with hearing-impaired individuals.","source":"data/test/moto_g_play.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[235,80,106,132,145,5,133,136,4,134,140,299,100,142,37,104,173,141,143,137,236,278,144,148,276,205,147,211,46,146,290,135,279,209,99,314,295,268,293,298,81,126,296,8,149,107,139,233,175,57,150,234,60,138,151,166,199,228,292,84,176,179,184,20,24,103,161,237,187,260,102,181,101,131,162,83,232,30,65,33,275,50,74,76,97,22,58,130,294,23,85,105,128,204,216,3,6,39,178,188,170,28,154,156,157,108,203,127,165,283,320,121,212,226,301,313,59,77,89,114,169,177,210,64,69,155,189,230,35,289,92,215,231,266,305,55,73,171,291,14,44,164,185,207,315,82,94,214,222,72,158,193,225,312,15,29,38,54,129,220,68,163,191,194,267,319,66,242,246,259,16,95,125,218,197,240,287,19,36,116,123,113,153,201,224,308,53,117,119,253,323,2,34,51,91,186,264,45,63,152,182,239,241,265,43,172,272,61,87,160,244,47,124,196,200,202,219,227,263,284,288,21,52,56,168,195,261,322,31,49,109,120,247,285,317,75,88,111,206,248,67,110,221,274,318,7,13,18,41,79,115,269,282,316,11,26,40,71,86,208,277,286,303,10,118,307,42,62,70,78,300,9,198,229,251,321,17,112,174,180,254,310,12,96,245,159,32,90,250,255,256,257,270,273,297,311,249,252,271,304,27,183,217,258,302,223,262,25,122,192,213,280,281,306,48,309,93,190,98,167,1,243,238],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What safety precautions should be taken when handling the Chopping Blade Assembly to avoid injury, and why is it important to follow these precautions?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[20],"raw_output":"","pred":"When handling the Chopping Blade Assembly, several safety precautions should be taken to avoid injury. Firstly, always grasp the blade assembly by the top of the shaft to ensure proper handling. This prevents the risk of laceration that could occur if the blade assembly is mishandled. Secondly, exercise care when handling the blade assembly, as it is sharp and not locked in place in the container. This means that the blade assembly can easily detach if not handled carefully. Thirdly, turn the appliance OFF, then unplug it from the socket before assembling or disassembling parts, and before cleaning. This prevents accidental activation of the appliance and reduces the risk of electric shock. Additionally, wash all parts that may contact food in warm, soapy water using a dishwashing utensil with a handle to avoid direct contact with the blades. Finally, inspect blade assemblies for damage before each use, and if a blade is bent or damaged, contact SharkNinja for replacement.\n\nFollowing these precautions is crucial because the Chopping Blade Assembly is sharp and can cause severe injury if mishandled. Proper handling ensures the safety of the user and prevents potential accidents that could lead to serious harm.","source":"data/test/bn650eu.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[19,20,21,22,23,28,35,24,27,44,11,45,34,5,36,51,52,18,12,38,13,43,55,29,2,15,39,14,31,37,53,59,7,10,60,3,4,26,42,75,8,47,30,40,74,79,32,54,56,50,16,46,61,76,77,80,63,58,6,17,48,62,68,1,70,78,71,33,69,66,41,72,64,65,25,57,9,49,81,83,67,73,82],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

By adding liquid, it likely helps to create a more fluid consistency that allows the ingredients to move more easily around the blades and through the machine.\n\nThe Auto-iQ® programs are described as the easiest way to achieve great results, with pulses and pauses that allow ingredients to settle towards the blade assembly. However, even with these programs, some ingredients may still get stuck if they are too dense or not properly prepared.\n\nAdding liquid is a simple solution that can help improve the flow of ingredients through the machine, potentially preventing or reducing the frequency of sticking issues.

{"question":"How does the image resolution setting impact both the quality of printed photos and the storage capacity on a memory card, and why might a photographer choose a lower resolution setting despite the potential decrease in image quality?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[57],"raw_output":"","pred":"The image resolution setting directly impacts both the quality of printed photos and the storage capacity on a memory card. A higher resolution, such as 20M (5184 x 3888 pixels), allows for larger, higher-quality prints without degrading the photo's image quality. This is because the number of recorded pixels is greater, providing more detail and clarity. Conversely, a lower resolution, like VGA (640 x 480 pixels), results in smaller, lower-quality prints due to fewer recorded pixels.\n\nDespite the potential decrease in image quality, a photographer might choose a lower resolution setting for several reasons. Firstly, a lower resolution setting allows for more images to be stored on a memory card, which is beneficial for photographers who need to capture a large number of images in a single session. Secondly, lower resolution images are smaller in file size, which can be advantageous for quick uploads or sharing on the internet. Lastly, the reduced file size can also lead to faster processing times during post-production. Therefore, while a higher resolution setting offers better print quality, the trade-off of reduced storage capacity and slower processing might make a lower resolution setting more practical for certain scenarios.","source":"data/test/pixpro_astro_zoom_az425.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[57,65,71,75,60,26,70,27,47,28,58,92,45,4,72,18,91,6,49,90,78,82,93,62,83,11,66,73,85,29,5,44,52,87,9,12,17,77,32,1,37,20,67,89,25,7,31,39,46,61,68,69,19,41,51,21,33,55,48,80,10,35,36,42,63,86,34,50,74,13,30,38,59,64,81,14,84,40,43,53,3,88,79,8,56,15,22,16,54,2,24,76,94,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

In this case, take the vacuum cleaner to a Philips service center or contact the Consumer Care Center for further assistance.","source":"data/test/aquatrio_cordless_9000_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[47,37,44,42,36,40,14,229,41,15,218,416,443,469,489,195,52,59,82,462,507,60,91,603,188,604,378,423,515,43,34,45,103,171,183,275,492,514,287,425,537,552,12,16,39,104,196,219,241,243,264,288,606,24,234,438,529,263,424,534,626,26,160,355,457,470,491,559,23,141,265,444,96,347,380,401,605,636,7,379,560,13,123,471,484,516,547,596,79,242,289,333,427,29,38,74,168,217,280,126,148,261,270,307,329,493,561,600,627,46,61,66,100,149,226,356,402,413,502,19,118,210,215,332,354,426,446,48,105,181,182,409,430,494,579,634,4,110,197,340,419,11,27,174,192,238,273,310,466,500,25,81,127,156,256,294,339,385,511,521,538,541,6,28,30,115,134,150,176,178,311,352,411,447,454,535,623,629,32,172,224,267,375,381,405,445,458,518,56,64,99,136,173,225,245,262,325,359,390,404,436,517,566,568,630,10,65,177,223,276,290,337,365,371,398,431,435,478,530,531,565,569,574,618,33,62,78,292,334,363,520,556,610,67,128,163,170,220,336,432,472,503,562,615,620,625,31,55,92,124,151,153,155,169,180,222,227,231,244,374,383,406,476,477,485,543,545,632,87,108,145,185,198,202,209,249,250,272,306,344,358,360,361,364,394,467,481,490,519,548,129,167,179,193,216,221,228,346,450,510,582,609,17,18,20,49,76,80,93,101,106,135,140,162,248,266,328,335,357,428,486,526,564,571,599,601,57,152,284,341,386,391,393,403,408,440,459,483,607,617,21,22,68,71,95,111,157,230,274,291,299,348,349,366,377,392,395,400,465,522,539,555,563,608,613,635,63,75,86,165,194,200,237,301,304,367,421,434,437,449,473,474,480,495,496,498,551,628,51,73,90,109,116,137,142,144,146,255,293,330,343,345,362,382,442,501,506,546,633,117,130,138,159,161,184,213,246,283,302,387,389,433,512,524,572,619,8,72,89,175,191,204,208,211,212,257,271,309,313,331,388,439,452,468,479,497,540,544,612,88,107,119,125,239,252,253,258,308,342,350,376,420,461,475,482,575,576,595,624,132,164,214,384,410,602,611,622,631,637,69,85,97,131,158,201,207,247,260,320,324,338,453,513,523,527,536,1,113,114,133,166,186,199,268,296,303,397,417,488,499,504,528,532,120,233,251,269,353,407,415,451,456,487,542,614,621,84,205,297,300,315,351,370,412,418,580,593,598,50,121,259,322,368,372,422,441,448,578,597,2,147,203,254,285,399,570,58,112,154,373,429,525,554,567,591,5,9,187,414,616,53,77,102,122,206,295,396,509,550,573,581,35,240,312,316,464,577,463,553,83,286,298,326,533,98,235,281,314,317,321,455,460,277,305,327,54,139,143,278,279,282,189,190,508,558,584,594,70,549,232,318,323,505,369,592,94,586,589,236,557,587,319,588,583,638,585,590,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

If the nozzle appears to be damaged, it may need to be replaced.\n\n4. **Check the Water Channel**: If the problem persists, check the water channel of the wet module and/or AquaSpin nozzle for any blockages or pollutants. Use the cleaning brush provided with the appliance to clean the water channel.\n\n5. **Contact Customer Support**: If the issue continues after trying the above steps, contact the Philips Consumer Care Center for further assistance.

{"question":"What is the function of the component highlighted in the diagram, and how does it interact with the vehicle's lighting system?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[219],"raw_output":"","pred":"The highlighted component in the diagram is the door-linked interior light switch. This switch controls the operation of the vehicle's interior lights based on the status of the doors. Specifically, it turns the lights on and off according to whether the doors are opened or closed.\n\nThe door-linked interior light switch interacts with the vehicle's lighting system in several ways:\n\n1. **Automatic On/Off**: When the doors are opened, the interior lights turn on, and when the doors are closed, the lights turn off. This provides convenience and energy efficiency by automatically illuminating the interior when the vehicle is accessed and turning off when the vehicle is secured.\n\n2. **Enhanced Safety**: The automatic illumination feature helps improve visibility inside the vehicle, which can be particularly useful in low-light conditions or when entering or exiting the vehicle in dark environments.\n\n3. **Battery-Saving Function**: To prevent the battery from being discharged, the interior lights will go off automatically after 20 minutes if the engine switch is turned off and the doors are closed. This ensures that the vehicle's battery remains charged, especially when the vehicle is parked for extended periods.\n\n4. **Emergency Activation**: In case of a strong rear impact or if any SRS airbags deploy, the interior lights will turn on automatically, providing additional illumination and visibility in critical situations.\n\nOverall, the door-linked interior light switch enhances the vehicle's safety and convenience by integrating seamlessly with the lighting system to respond to the vehicle's door status.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[198,219,385,91,342,345,99,313,378,153,211,248,328,578,151,210,316,369,576,72,155,206,266,285,347,411,95,156,308,3,45,199,225,246,346,381,382,388,490,577,88,102,124,166,247,318,329,334,343,416,68,83,262,267,377,398,415,15,82,162,172,212,265,338,374,375,463,506,574,203,216,294,545,566,302,344,350,20,220,257,304,307,327,368,575,25,69,96,218,281,293,320,322,341,558,37,73,89,122,136,152,215,383,384,409,86,103,112,118,127,178,228,306,335,337,348,370,379,380,397,512,7,71,100,123,232,258,259,264,269,284,301,413,85,90,126,130,137,141,208,330,340,376,407,417,509,47,79,223,229,254,277,323,355,484,542,550,573,579,13,48,76,139,272,278,291,296,326,331,402,445,580,16,18,22,44,80,106,121,168,177,204,214,253,270,282,300,336,391,485,559,17,38,94,115,116,217,224,249,357,421,435,438,454,467,519,592,97,150,163,170,268,367,462,138,154,171,226,242,261,280,315,324,333,339,466,43,93,164,207,289,351,430,472,501,549,33,41,110,119,128,240,352,373,513,546,1,92,221,390,551,273,412,432,459,491,508,111,167,286,295,297,424,428,570,10,129,173,213,237,356,372,548,74,78,134,245,371,408,440,478,539,547,84,260,311,393,395,401,446,487,534,569,14,19,145,158,159,174,239,241,319,325,544,125,222,243,263,279,504,540,583,594,24,77,227,406,414,442,453,476,571,6,9,23,132,161,292,298,434,498,572,581,98,101,107,299,389,418,455,479,582,50,58,169,312,314,387,464,468,502,505,567,593,597,70,81,117,271,392,423,450,465,470,527,560,66,244,276,288,400,433,477,496,515,543,563,589,59,67,105,231,332,403,483,503,530,64,114,188,196,349,399,404,427,480,494,541,598,57,60,87,113,140,175,192,238,305,362,394,460,499,562,32,35,46,133,230,274,287,290,317,419,62,157,309,429,52,190,363,386,422,469,536,4,42,165,252,256,452,588,595,56,131,185,303,474,510,2,26,183,354,359,436,537,21,29,53,61,104,135,176,181,194,236,255,283,321,410,492,591,189,235,251,275,361,437,486,514,528,564,49,120,184,234,521,584,144,195,202,209,522,526,533,561,27,191,310,405,471,40,193,205,358,448,481,482,489,511,28,30,36,182,201,443,447,554,149,396,493,495,552,586,497,568,596,34,51,63,143,179,187,500,31,54,441,451,146,186,439,456,461,535,587,590,65,200,538,585,39,109,366,473,553,250,353,360,233,12,148,420,475,488,523,525,11,55,147,507,108,142,160,75,449,458,520,425,529,180,197,365,457,518,557,431,517,555,556,565,8,426,532,5,531,364,444,516,524],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

Its purpose is to prevent the engine from accelerating the vehicle when the brake pedal is depressed simultaneously with the accelerator pedal. This is designed to prevent unintended acceleration or sudden acceleration when the driver may be trying to brake but accidentally presses the accelerator instead.\n\nWhen the Brake Override System is activated, it will take over control of the vehicle's braking system, overriding any attempt to accelerate. This can affect the driver's experience in several ways:\n\n1. It may cause the vehicle to decelerate more quickly than intended, potentially leading to sudden stops or harsh braking.\n\n2. The driver may feel a noticeable change in the vehicle's response to their inputs, as the system takes over control.\n\n3. It may cause the vehicle to feel less responsive to the driver's braking efforts, as the system is prioritizing safety over the driver's intended acceleration.\n\n4. The system may activate even if the driver is trying to accelerate, potentially causing confusion or frustration.\n\n5. It may require the driver to release the accelerator pedal and depress the brake pedal to regain control of the vehicle.\n\nOverall, the Brake Override System is designed to enhance safety by preventing unintended acceleration, but it may require some adjustment for the driver to become accustomed to its operation.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[180,479,581,580,217,184,79,216,502,311,354,214,342,477,192,241,288,309,245,301,266,486,296,346,484,77,78,307,356,273,571,578,38,181,353,3,268,341,359,471,177,215,339,494,340,357,355,492,235,263,324,344,347,567,570,276,485,487,271,361,365,569,22,283,338,209,308,7,137,246,267,299,304,445,495,501,185,257,490,527,579,4,183,259,446,572,213,222,248,249,275,165,200,205,208,350,16,219,220,250,252,282,298,303,316,358,428,236,280,318,345,491,576,204,274,310,312,325,348,116,182,191,195,260,277,328,349,515,548,469,493,27,127,134,203,242,258,272,331,336,337,343,371,507,543,573,592,89,130,194,207,278,289,300,432,464,2,10,46,90,129,133,333,370,476,483,506,510,74,87,94,178,193,313,422,73,132,179,186,232,234,262,323,332,441,478,546,68,119,211,247,319,430,473,503,562,218,221,240,256,321,351,420,542,547,563,70,155,253,281,317,326,41,61,95,139,198,251,265,290,305,363,375,421,544,91,118,128,166,168,254,284,285,287,302,334,335,429,440,447,456,497,552,566,590,111,136,223,297,314,577,6,30,56,60,72,105,117,125,199,202,233,243,292,294,369,451,574,12,57,101,126,131,142,210,229,293,315,352,373,374,392,452,482,545,575,92,98,110,201,322,403,509,1,69,82,93,103,123,138,279,291,306,320,330,360,404,438,439,449,453,458,475,480,489,40,45,122,140,151,158,170,244,255,368,372,405,472,504,523,549,551,102,149,156,163,176,226,327,378,481,550,33,49,65,71,96,164,169,174,230,239,329,381,402,457,462,531,8,14,44,52,76,100,135,153,172,380,382,408,426,450,536,564,591,21,115,152,171,383,436,474,512,561,47,48,51,59,86,109,196,206,269,286,385,391,397,406,427,460,513,19,36,97,112,121,124,159,162,270,412,431,522,538,55,106,120,188,225,261,470,526,532,80,81,264,362,364,514,9,104,114,411,560,589,20,32,42,43,99,161,175,238,377,212,387,433,468,541,582,584,11,25,50,228,367,444,454,508,540,596,35,83,295,379,401,467,511,594,85,150,366,376,400,409,415,419,448,37,67,173,231,384,395,424,5,18,31,58,84,160,463,520,197,237,398,399,435,559,593,598,62,141,190,227,407,443,535,28,29,63,64,167,388,521,583,587,15,154,413,437,461,539,556,66,386,390,416,496,500,517,537,39,144,148,224,423,459,524,558,53,189,505,519,534,107,113,145,414,498,143,417,425,442,455,88,393,396,530,24,23,389,488,147,13,466,157,553,518,410,418,465,34,533,499,557,595,75,187,108,434,525,586,529,568,555,588,597,528,146,394,565,585,26,54,554,516,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The upward direction of the arrow specifically indicates the direction of the deviation, helping the driver understand the situation quickly.\n\nOverall, the upward-pointing arrow in this diagram likely represents a lane departure warning or prevention system, designed to alert the driver to potential lane departure and assist in maintaining proper lane position on curved roads.","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[241,234,242,238,291,302,240,230,270,304,274,110,333,232,303,70,253,298,307,246,301,177,178,272,95,261,359,256,262,269,366,411,141,224,286,312,86,247,289,271,313,103,260,364,393,191,263,290,144,251,300,335,386,396,410,259,264,102,142,225,318,13,214,220,275,279,284,296,321,104,158,165,223,276,297,3,213,294,314,434,442,547,245,281,283,320,76,112,131,244,258,273,306,325,424,485,7,113,243,266,268,308,461,85,212,250,252,323,514,539,542,78,114,166,249,267,282,315,332,438,537,63,77,96,129,194,228,229,236,254,257,285,287,215,218,237,280,299,305,38,82,105,143,187,216,231,248,277,288,535,99,201,227,265,317,507,32,100,150,190,198,199,217,235,420,544,42,189,219,222,226,255,293,295,311,543,66,211,221,239,316,324,369,449,564,34,88,203,310,322,402,526,536,64,73,84,93,210,278,339,340,437,546,2,22,109,126,133,309,459,515,37,69,108,111,149,157,173,292,319,338,425,465,524,20,30,57,61,79,91,98,146,208,387,415,422,466,561,26,72,92,185,540,545,25,65,138,154,361,406,419,428,525,527,140,233,349,452,14,18,39,83,197,337,372,462,477,523,55,182,464,475,56,172,204,336,516,115,162,362,17,62,120,344,453,513,533,53,160,163,168,183,327,331,473,517,45,169,184,401,450,481,43,87,107,326,350,405,421,451,15,19,27,145,345,412,470,528,23,46,68,132,371,397,417,432,469,51,67,328,342,29,31,35,49,392,548,181,188,334,413,416,8,206,360,382,403,426,439,10,97,130,148,153,351,430,134,192,346,358,487,538,550,559,40,127,128,195,509,529,41,54,75,94,170,330,384,385,408,1,44,58,174,341,395,444,472,541,59,81,122,394,50,80,167,383,510,6,117,355,374,404,441,474,498,89,348,365,389,418,479,171,433,478,512,52,101,139,179,376,390,391,407,436,458,508,48,137,147,180,202,375,480,554,60,151,193,455,519,552,186,21,36,125,175,209,353,363,476,161,435,440,446,506,532,116,368,399,463,200,388,445,489,4,28,33,74,468,563,381,494,24,205,429,460,534,12,119,123,196,367,370,502,522,16,155,156,207,356,400,457,378,106,414,443,454,496,47,135,136,380,409,518,560,9,347,431,557,373,488,556,152,159,555,562,11,121,329,398,495,553,343,456,423,448,493,497,176,377,558,71,357,486,427,447,521,5,551,511,124,354,503,379,484,352,467,492,530,499,504,500,471,491,490,164,90,501,549,505,483,520,118,482,531],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This ensures the mirror will automatically tilt to the correct downward angle when you shift to R from next time.\n\nBy following this procedure, you can maintain the proper mirror angle for reversing even after adjusting the normal position, preventing any issues with the linked mirror function.","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[146,542,544,144,296,532,297,316,308,28,186,145,299,111,216,38,171,201,453,148,287,161,323,101,158,288,352,423,89,192,206,218,280,43,112,169,252,330,411,528,1,215,303,355,390,391,469,494,170,172,217,238,251,295,105,232,292,327,354,422,427,533,4,73,94,127,151,200,205,224,231,425,467,480,481,14,15,157,285,305,309,362,413,516,53,74,143,150,294,325,2,55,140,175,182,234,302,310,322,387,416,440,445,474,476,208,265,304,307,314,324,337,351,356,378,386,392,396,448,451,457,473,534,47,95,123,130,154,156,173,181,210,329,336,410,419,475,539,560,96,129,134,167,219,230,267,300,306,405,442,543,139,180,220,233,242,256,270,284,326,397,398,463,17,119,195,207,212,279,358,359,399,429,511,5,32,68,69,121,137,193,236,239,240,275,368,374,401,446,509,538,12,85,132,138,153,184,189,198,344,349,402,461,506,515,54,58,60,131,141,183,199,221,222,237,281,369,375,404,441,459,479,526,531,537,30,61,76,125,160,211,243,257,277,383,407,426,438,26,27,75,86,188,244,248,370,389,393,403,412,443,450,454,455,466,493,523,535,541,40,135,168,187,197,255,343,433,436,59,159,165,178,185,290,313,319,320,328,334,347,348,400,431,439,471,3,6,103,149,152,260,293,338,364,381,415,420,472,540,546,547,563,16,62,88,90,120,227,430,437,449,536,562,70,126,136,204,209,235,264,274,278,282,357,360,379,421,465,517,558,45,57,117,272,301,333,382,408,551,33,77,78,116,177,254,263,335,365,395,409,432,468,527,561,128,249,266,268,317,339,340,367,406,417,470,477,478,510,530,39,142,179,194,286,291,315,373,444,462,464,512,513,525,545,35,50,52,84,147,202,225,372,418,434,460,31,133,155,213,259,283,321,345,361,428,553,559,19,29,56,79,104,250,273,276,298,366,447,514,518,519,552,557,65,124,174,228,247,258,269,353,384,388,394,414,550,23,72,113,122,191,229,271,318,342,346,435,452,508,555,18,21,46,164,203,214,223,502,507,522,529,554,7,8,10,91,102,110,163,166,176,289,363,456,489,499,9,82,226,241,332,371,36,106,377,424,548,64,80,190,253,350,556,245,261,262,487,48,87,99,312,385,13,44,71,108,341,83,93,107,11,98,100,109,118,311,498,504,20,41,49,246,376,380,482,505,37,66,92,162,488,97,196,42,501,115,331,520,67,496,25,81,495,503,63,114,492,458,521,524,491,51,490,22,34,483,500,549,24,486,484,497,485,564],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This means that the driver should take control of the vehicle and steer as needed to maintain safe driving conditions.\n\nThe implications of not following these actions can be significant. If the driver does not manually operate the steering wheel, the vehicle may continue to operate in an autonomous mode, which could lead to potential safety hazards. For instance, the vehicle might not respond appropriately to sudden changes in traffic conditions, such as a vehicle cutting in front or a road obstruction. This could result in a collision or other accidents, putting the driver and others at risk.

{"question":"What are the potential consequences of adding electrical equipment to a vehicle with an integrated OnStar system, and how might this impact the vehicle's functionality and user experience?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[413],"raw_output":"","pred":"Adding electrical equipment to a vehicle with an integrated OnStar system can have several potential consequences. Firstly, the OnStar system is designed to work within a specific electrical architecture. Any unauthorized electrical equipment can interfere with this system, potentially causing it to malfunction or fail to operate altogether. This interference can lead to a variety of issues, including reduced communication capabilities, loss of emergency services, and disruptions to the vehicle's overall safety features.\n\nSecondly, the OnStar system relies on a vehicle electrical system, wireless service, and GPS satellite technologies. Adding electrical equipment can disrupt these systems, leading to operational failures. For instance, the battery may become drained more quickly, affecting the vehicle's performance and range. Additionally, the vehicle's power management system may be overwhelmed, causing erratic behavior or even system crashes.\n\nFrom a user experience perspective, these issues can result in a less reliable and potentially dangerous driving environment. Users may experience delays in accessing emergency services, reduced functionality of the infotainment system, and increased risk of system malfunctions during critical driving situations. Therefore, it is crucial to consult with the dealer before adding any electrical equipment to ensure compatibility and maintain the vehicle's safety and operational integrity.","source":"data/test/silverado_ev_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[413,322,408,417,245,412,420,10,409,411,415,423,154,425,391,414,325,69,410,419,173,237,19,242,155,184,105,172,401,100,360,429,101,416,124,183,397,102,207,332,182,252,272,179,197,210,20,274,159,171,321,31,67,187,205,212,236,379,42,54,161,229,260,265,311,326,65,103,185,307,319,333,338,68,70,93,160,198,277,293,296,310,2,53,141,150,157,211,281,405,137,287,295,313,335,352,200,146,168,218,294,306,324,334,407,181,186,233,271,275,312,35,37,66,163,167,225,331,336,374,376,381,422,12,15,16,50,76,104,114,148,153,228,258,269,273,359,427,22,97,99,120,131,156,165,170,280,346,368,418,57,63,94,144,189,190,216,262,9,40,59,135,214,267,399,402,4,6,8,23,108,152,178,243,256,261,354,380,387,132,134,149,169,180,193,247,254,279,323,5,13,24,33,64,118,164,199,223,238,249,289,292,337,367,421,115,133,145,151,166,204,246,320,364,365,377,426,7,44,58,89,106,162,175,191,270,284,288,316,339,342,362,363,378,424,11,129,202,208,253,308,350,369,41,48,91,121,122,123,136,188,302,315,231,250,251,314,403,128,138,177,201,206,213,219,263,264,282,305,309,356,384,406,158,192,291,297,299,351,382,86,92,116,126,143,209,234,239,266,268,383,21,49,60,61,95,98,107,109,117,127,235,290,327,400,30,39,75,110,176,255,345,386,388,390,14,112,147,194,278,298,344,366,18,72,142,174,195,222,224,226,259,276,340,358,385,392,3,119,203,227,248,283,329,370,428,43,111,343,347,389,17,36,47,77,241,330,29,96,113,232,404,34,81,285,304,398,25,46,51,85,130,139,301,372,32,38,221,230,244,257,341,375,52,87,361,196,215,318,349,62,125,286,355,373,82,217,300,353,74,220,317,45,55,328,28,371,26,73,240,303,1,84,71,393,357,88,79,27,140,56,83,395,396,80,78,90,348,394],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Object identification: Voice labels allow users to attach descriptive labels to objects, helping them identify items in their environment even when they cannot see them. This is particularly useful for distinguishing between objects that may look similar.\n\n2. Contextual understanding: By combining voice labels with TalkBack's voice feedback, users can get a more comprehensive understanding of their surroundings. For example, they can hear the label for an object while also hearing the voice feedback about the object's location or other relevant information.\n\n3. Navigation assistance: Voice labels can be used to label landmarks or important points in a space, providing users with more detailed navigation cues.\n\n4. Customization: Users can create their own voice labels for specific objects or areas, tailoring the experience to their needs.\n\nHowever, there are potential limitations:\n\n1. Overload: Too many voice labels or complex label systems could overwhelm users.\n\n2.

Once released, the camera will refocus based on the current scene.\n\nThis difference allows for more flexibility in different shooting scenarios:\n\nExposure lock is useful for situations where you want to lock in a specific exposure setting for multiple shots, such as when shooting in low light or with a fixed aperture.\n\nFocus lock is better for situations where you need to recompose the shot without losing focus, such as when shooting moving subjects or when the subject is not in the center of the frame.\n\nThe ability to choose between these two locking modes gives photographers more control over their shots and allows them to adapt to different shooting conditions more effectively.","source":"data/test/d5600.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[280,265,261,11,417,260,385,156,421,119,367,259,418,120,277,8,177,7,220,332,108,38,111,152,162,296,365,164,179,46,143,163,264,180,282,412,45,73,334,342,396,416,58,148,294,33,78,281,369,32,80,114,263,27,43,109,178,278,419,31,76,110,201,219,364,372,383,146,154,218,249,331,121,258,283,346,368,386,48,54,77,153,157,102,112,142,415,72,402,150,166,185,311,312,57,79,88,129,279,344,373,44,141,255,275,165,172,336,341,343,378,406,47,122,127,128,130,160,192,377,379,387,200,345,16,93,133,147,155,223,293,347,400,191,210,212,246,274,284,291,371,5,211,384,414,37,71,86,95,116,144,272,273,276,330,366,408,12,34,103,117,125,131,158,159,30,91,104,140,193,292,301,309,420,29,67,182,256,303,404,410,28,36,69,190,214,262,290,314,333,375,405,17,75,82,101,126,196,306,335,349,376,51,85,106,135,161,170,248,295,370,98,167,267,304,313,398,399,409,49,60,113,173,203,216,228,245,254,362,382,403,35,118,268,297,307,2,24,41,64,70,137,199,298,300,338,356,14,18,81,123,138,187,337,374,389,395,401,50,68,89,115,151,197,213,289,302,324,325,340,348,174,184,226,288,320,328,422,92,107,136,145,149,195,225,234,244,319,388,411,13,53,87,96,105,169,269,285,317,357,25,56,181,224,227,257,321,392,94,247,252,318,329,361,22,66,326,352,354,65,271,327,99,100,322,351,39,188,189,198,238,270,350,359,97,250,299,42,59,233,253,3,208,217,232,308,315,10,90,205,360,84,266,202,61,62,229,240,286,358,413,9,239,310,74,186,390,63,139,222,20,52,176,215,287,83,171,237,305,391,124,183,251,15,355,380,397,393,231,316,407,4,175,194,40,132,339,207,1,19,168,26,230,394,323,353,206,23,134,209,235,236,204,55,423,6,241,21,221,363,242,243,381,424],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1}]}
{"question":"What is the relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of the lens described in the document, and how does this relationship affect the depth of field and exposure in photography?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[410],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of the lens described in the document is inversely proportional. As the focal length increases, the maximum aperture decreases, and vice versa. For instance, the lens has a focal length range of 18-55 mm with a maximum aperture of f/3.5-5.6, and for a 70-300 mm focal length, the maximum aperture is f/4.5-6.3.\n\nThis relationship significantly affects the depth of field and exposure in photography. A longer focal length (e.g., 300 mm) with a smaller maximum aperture (e.g., f/6.3) results in a shallower depth of field, meaning that only a small portion of the image will be in sharp focus, while the rest will be blurred. This is useful for isolating subjects from the background in portraits or wildlife photography. Conversely, a shorter focal length (e.g., 18 mm) with a larger maximum aperture (e.g., f/3.5) allows for a deeper depth of field, keeping more of the image in focus, which is beneficial for landscape photography or when capturing details in the foreground and background.\n\nThe maximum aperture also affects exposure. A larger maximum aperture (e.g., f/3.5) allows more light to enter the lens, reducing the exposure time needed to achieve a proper exposure, which is crucial in low-light conditions. A smaller maximum aperture (e.g., f/6.3) requires more exposure time to let in sufficient light, which can be beneficial for capturing motion or achieving a specific effect like a soft blur.","source":"data/test/d5600.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[400,405,410,379,292,340,220,148,75,218,332,264,338,402,401,412,418,122,395,383,336,257,334,406,382,165,259,179,276,294,146,144,331,43,147,151,190,149,150,367,370,414,333,145,143,112,419,8,86,118,377,47,131,7,102,110,120,180,282,129,261,345,346,375,384,385,44,119,403,31,106,154,293,78,85,121,33,113,142,254,265,280,371,420,76,116,132,152,155,81,114,156,11,28,37,58,67,98,398,32,157,387,407,408,199,56,79,90,105,108,153,192,260,263,99,178,341,5,342,348,364,46,168,397,36,45,123,256,275,74,80,109,159,250,277,318,368,396,415,94,96,197,201,16,196,314,344,347,361,378,404,416,38,111,267,337,343,411,103,194,200,335,366,409,115,140,160,211,93,95,130,284,315,399,73,101,135,138,198,417,421,39,48,104,133,245,274,386,57,164,177,273,339,413,423,117,127,258,369,422,50,53,210,317,322,359,128,163,176,187,281,296,312,3,193,195,14,35,82,107,205,306,89,252,319,321,91,217,223,262,272,358,17,92,97,136,158,191,212,249,268,354,77,87,181,204,214,222,290,303,308,309,29,241,255,13,41,124,137,184,186,216,219,248,307,311,313,365,9,172,173,269,30,84,166,167,185,251,253,278,286,125,202,372,6,10,12,62,63,134,139,175,236,362,169,215,230,232,323,324,27,49,141,213,72,203,231,234,289,391,240,171,209,228,287,360,388,126,162,183,208,226,229,247,320,349,363,100,170,174,207,246,283,291,351,23,64,88,161,224,242,244,295,305,356,357,2,34,54,83,225,310,353,373,298,424,21,270,235,59,239,52,206,266,376,389,24,61,352,271,325,279,380,300,182,25,299,238,393,20,55,68,71,288,390,22,1,65,233,237,392,70,316,69,304,227,302,355,51,66,330,381,328,350,4,301,42,40,221,243,297,15,189,19,60,374,327,394,18,326,285,26,329,188],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"Explain how using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator can help minimize energy consumption, ensuring to reference the underlying physics.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[9],"raw_output":"","pred":"Using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator minimizes energy consumption by leveraging the latent heat of fusion.  When frozen food is placed in the refrigerator, it absorbs heat from the surrounding air, causing the ice crystals to melt. This process requires energy, but it's a small fraction of the energy needed to cool the food from room temperature to the desired refrigerated temperature.  Essentially, the refrigerator is doing less work because it's using the food itself to cool down.  This is a more efficient process than actively cooling the food from room temperature, which requires the refrigerator to remove more heat from the food and the surrounding air.  Therefore, using frozen food to thaw helps conserve energy by reducing the overall cooling load on the refrigerator.\n","source":"data/test/rf59c7_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[9,26,20,55,102,294,181,372,151,347,85,340,156,313,21,103,342,5,182,279,60,122,199,157,198,221,295,371,278,64,66,86,87,116,118,183,280,307,319,115,213,351,360,149,256,290,303,180,249,306,309,194,171,302,373,308,113,146,158,262,339,100,108,128,168,220,314,61,209,311,323,335,350,374,10,79,117,120,144,152,169,226,247,301,353,18,32,98,119,244,268,281,288,349,369,77,84,111,174,193,364,132,214,254,269,289,7,163,190,338,343,53,105,179,16,24,62,73,106,110,112,164,195,277,298,23,52,178,261,282,304,354,368,121,173,175,205,215,259,1,292,310,348,114,137,230,291,19,78,172,208,266,274,296,67,93,324,97,142,267,286,346,359,81,109,123,250,6,82,207,216,276,358,17,22,25,94,125,147,155,161,162,176,299,4,68,101,154,203,219,240,293,297,355,189,202,258,328,332,366,96,223,271,327,367,253,265,285,56,104,196,317,8,107,136,148,160,234,242,83,88,184,197,365,11,14,15,80,210,237,352,300,312,75,170,201,245,275,363,177,257,273,12,59,153,167,200,333,375,99,159,217,218,263,362,235,305,357,63,134,231,255,272,13,57,133,330,370,336,337,246,58,143,270,356,141,252,260,264,316,29,46,145,211,212,251,206,320,334,2,48,72,232,248,331,344,41,222,239,37,65,225,315,50,241,38,51,76,129,139,227,228,318,47,165,40,166,345,192,45,243,321,127,204,74,150,233,36,71,30,329,28,126,130,361,33,43,34,49,325,224,31,238,229,124,138,341,27,326,69,188,380,236,140,191,70,42,284,287,95,135,39,54,3,44,35,376,92,131,322,89,283,185,90,377,91,379,187,378,186],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

When activated, cruise control automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed to keep it at a consistent speed set by the driver. This can be particularly useful for long highway drives, as it helps maintain a steady speed and reduces driver fatigue.\n\nThe cruise control button typically has an icon that resembles a speedometer with a line through it, as shown in the image. When pressed, it engages cruise control and allows the driver to set a desired speed. The vehicle will then maintain that speed until the driver manually adjusts it or turns off the system.\n\nCruise control can be especially beneficial for fuel efficiency, as it helps keep the vehicle at an optimal speed for fuel consumption.

It results in an immediate and complete loss of device functionality. An example of a catastrophic failure is a memory DIMM that receives a static shock and immediately generates a \"No POST/No Video\" symptom with a beep code emitted for missing or nonfunctional memory. This type of damage is more easily recognizable and can be immediately identified upon occurrence.\n\n2. **Intermittent Failure**: This type of ESD damage represents approximately 80% of ESD-related failures. It is characterized by high visibility and is more common. The DIMM receives a static shock, but the damage is not immediately recognizable. The weakened trace may take weeks or months to melt, causing degradation of memory integrity, intermittent memory errors, etc. This type of damage is more difficult to recognize and troubleshoot because the symptoms are not immediately apparent.\n\nIn summary, catastrophic failures are immediate and easily identifiable, while intermittent failures are more common, less immediately recognizable, and can cause long-term degradation of device functionality.","source":"data/test/inspiron_16_plus_7630.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[32,31,33,94,29,96,2,3,95,30,98,53,101,26,7,8,97,99,20,90,16,12,5,6,100,23,36,87,19,22,91,27,88,86,92,93,89,24,25,72,1,76,85,43,9,14,28,80,10,13,73,21,60,37,70,77,11,50,18,41,39,17,38,78,15,79,66,82,83,59,71,44,4,34,65,49,75,55,61,62,64,74,52,68,35,54,67,42,46,48,40,84,47,45,57,51,56,58,69,63,81],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Specifically, several advanced features are not supported. These include Parental Controls, Quality of Service (QoS), and Network Address Translation (NAT) Forwarding. Parental Controls are used to restrict internet access based on time of day or content, QoS helps prioritize certain types of traffic, and NAT Forwarding allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address. These features are crucial for managing and securing a network, but they are disabled in Access Point mode.\n\nOn the other hand, some features remain the same as in Router mode, such as Guest Network, which allows creating a separate wireless network for guests without compromising the main network's security. This ensures that guests can access the internet without having full access to the main network, maintaining privacy and security.","source":"data/test/archer_ax21.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[21,2,89,51,40,80,27,62,8,15,16,37,72,92,90,99,103,105,5,26,38,75,83,32,65,77,56,100,13,28,31,81,97,106,29,64,86,88,107,52,82,87,3,25,41,46,49,59,76,57,61,101,110,35,6,9,17,67,96,54,44,74,79,18,84,111,36,68,73,12,63,78,94,30,85,91,34,50,71,112,33,39,66,93,4,22,104,102,10,24,53,60,69,108,109,58,55,95,1,23,14,19,20,11,70,43,98,48,45,7,47,42],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"Explain why cloning your computer's MAC address to your router might be necessary when using a cable modem for internet access, and describe the potential issue that could arise if the router's default LAN IP address conflicts with your existing modem/router.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[105],"raw_output":"","pred":"Cloning your computer's MAC address to your router is necessary when using a cable modem because the ISP often registers the MAC address of your computer when you first access the internet.  If you then add a router to share the connection, the ISP may reject it because the registered MAC address has changed.  By cloning the computer's MAC address to the router, you ensure the ISP recognizes the new device as the same one it originally registered.\n\nA potential issue arises if the router's default LAN IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1) conflicts with the IP range of your existing ADSL modem/router.  This conflict prevents the router from communicating with the modem, and you won't be able to access the internet.  To resolve this, you need to change the router's LAN IP address to a unique one that doesn't overlap with your existing modem/router's IP range.  For example, you could change it to 192.168.2.1.  After making this change, you must restart both the modem and the router to ensure the new configuration is applied.\n","source":"data/test/archer_ax21.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[105,104,18,12,72,19,15,75,101,106,53,57,103,9,54,77,60,61,27,93,107,17,40,65,74,87,92,21,29,58,64,73,69,13,24,55,90,28,108,78,22,38,49,44,56,91,51,98,66,109,25,37,46,3,5,52,59,62,82,88,89,68,26,67,23,63,83,96,2,76,86,94,79,16,35,39,50,102,36,97,6,33,32,20,41,99,110,84,100,31,80,81,111,4,85,95,71,11,8,14,34,112,10,45,43,47,30,70,7,1,48,42],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This central control point would enable parents to quickly navigate to different settings and restrictions, tailoring the device experience to their child's needs and age-appropriate guidelines.","source":"data/test/maxstream_mr5500_series.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[632,46,407,471,535,696,729,143,176,242,439,827,79,340,762,794,274,373,503,111,600,664,13,306,567,210,404,597,207,336,621,435,823,824,76,303,499,758,108,206,238,271,302,467,531,564,436,563,692,693,790,9,107,369,403,532,596,629,660,12,75,270,398,559,599,688,725,826,42,139,172,370,500,720,786,818,167,337,431,631,5,10,201,406,628,37,239,266,372,468,527,591,624,695,726,753,103,140,142,234,305,331,463,558,759,135,175,209,339,365,656,728,495,566,791,45,71,43,362,438,661,699,110,534,761,173,502,78,470,164,241,301,353,298,332,273,663,588,625,667,793,295,351,830,801,2,309,49,418,592,627,760,732,18,179,247,376,395,685,82,328,334,412,506,69,343,410,603,637,765,114,317,510,570,611,6,181,605,701,104,146,277,307,440,538,585,635,799,84,279,311,443,476,560,594,669,734,797,828,213,214,221,245,437,466,474,697,795,16,83,116,122,183,198,371,377,601,40,246,252,299,378,472,659,727,766,767,8,17,36,77,112,147,177,278,345,434,442,539,833,215,249,515,568,700,763,208,217,275,408,413,444,571,730,834,70,74,80,148,243,341,475,481,508,509,540,604,665,138,182,211,374,572,623,718,773,344,409,417,504,507,514,536,562,679,772,792,14,51,204,223,338,364,565,578,610,613,633,698,756,798,832,15,144,200,202,312,363,421,422,687,719,769,796,829,72,411,414,694,819,821,825,4,11,44,115,121,253,320,387,397,399,405,484,533,537,549,556,662,731,733,774,817,47,53,65,86,174,285,304,310,375,380,430,494,513,577,586,636,638,645,703,707,737,785,815,19,89,90,109,125,153,187,281,284,297,313,342,379,461,630,634,689,747,812,102,106,156,190,240,255,272,330,347,366,401,469,516,545,574,580,607,841,23,24,145,354,446,542,548,573,598,639,646,648,650,674,708,710,750,800,838,58,60,149,157,276,346,441,530,642,691,784,134,166,384,432,655,677,706,709,736,764,768,805,68,118,220,237,478,501,526,546,740,752,754,775,843,92,265,269,288,308,350,450,452,547,606,614,641,657,675,739,48,57,141,150,321,415,423,489,505,590,647,64,101,192,216,264,355,420,449,483,486,493,569,666,804,807,813,32,62,94,100,170,193,233,248,445,453,457,460,512,541,557,609,618,673,702,743,744,20,26,27,50,59,117,124,165,178,286,319,383,428,454,462,482,487,492,524,615,643,644,671,676,806,811,52,113,129,287,323,368,426,458,477,602,705,735,28,38,81,85,229,316,325,326,329,429,451,464,480,517,581,584,712,741,780,781,55,56,188,189,280,352,386,390,424,498,704,776,839,30,63,93,222,225,254,425,427,448,511,553,612,680,723,783,808,840,97,258,382,385,576,579,616,742,745,831,35,91,123,154,169,259,283,318,392,473,640,25,87,88,95,127,151,194,388,389,479,544,668,771,789,816,3,31,34,130,180,185,195,226,257,267,455,721,738,748,787,809,844,66,158,162,191,228,393,416,447,485,520,551,582,649,670,686,717,751,126,212,232,244,250,260,289,356,419,518,575,714,779,845,22,120,155,160,186,256,282,290,357,396,543,654,672,711,778,803,98,159,251,296,678,788,846,315,359,360,525,550,619,681,777,802,810,29,224,231,322,456,488,519,682,33,184,324,335,391,552,583,617,837,61,136,261,713,715,842,21,41,96,219,227,291,292,490,608,622,653,722,746,119,132,433,465,497,554,626,683,757,770,836,39,105,128,161,349,400,521,133,218,235,402,152,263,528,589,820,367,595,459,651,358,684,755,196,522,593,658,268,782,73,54,199,203,137,690,168,236,205,7,381,847,262,529,496,652,171,361,314,716,724,491,67,99,293,822,848,300,327,561,620,333,163,230,555,294,394,348,523,814,835,1,587,131,749,197],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Specifically, it states:\n\n\"Login Type (cloud: show email address associated, local: display \"Router admin\")\"\n\nThis information would be included in the diagnostic data sent to Linksys when reporting issues. \n\nThe impact on user privacy considerations is significant:\n\n1.

{"question":"How can adjusting the position of your phone during a call improve your experience while using hearing aids?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[193],"raw_output":"","pred":"Adjusting the position of your phone during a call can significantly improve your experience when using hearing aids. Hearing aids are designed to amplify sound, but they can also pick up ambient noise and feedback, which can interfere with the clarity of the call. By rotating or moving the phone to the best position for speaking and listening, you can minimize these issues.\n\nFor instance, placing the phone closer to your mouth can enhance the clarity of your voice, making it easier for the other person to hear you. Conversely, positioning the phone away from your ear can reduce the risk of feedback, which is when the amplified sound from the hearing aid is picked up by the microphone and amplified again, creating a loud and distorted sound. This feedback can be particularly problematic in noisy environments.\n\nAdditionally, adjusting the phone's position can help in managing the balance between the amplified sound from the hearing aid and the ambient noise. By placing the phone in a position that minimizes background noise, you can ensure that the other person hears your voice clearly without the interference of surrounding sounds.\n\nIn summary, adjusting the phone's position during a call can help in optimizing the sound quality, reducing feedback, and improving the overall communication experience when using hearing aids.","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[193,239,102,38,156,194,240,245,103,5,107,100,160,159,23,65,101,6,19,129,162,45,175,230,238,40,118,242,105,106,147,163,196,228,164,24,26,61,237,4,192,21,140,176,113,58,117,151,219,232,115,9,82,166,47,50,81,104,190,203,7,95,150,191,254,13,46,186,56,227,236,55,63,90,174,226,41,78,108,205,29,51,153,169,30,109,134,157,62,152,218,110,231,16,70,91,173,241,3,11,114,143,195,8,20,136,158,177,207,243,252,258,42,52,112,208,57,111,161,222,14,49,73,96,99,122,244,178,224,35,184,198,211,257,94,144,168,25,53,64,87,130,234,131,138,146,206,223,44,69,139,209,247,260,18,54,93,185,225,98,126,154,183,33,59,132,167,212,249,255,27,48,60,75,135,148,165,204,210,216,251,119,246,15,36,97,133,188,214,31,137,189,197,253,34,233,172,200,201,217,248,12,74,125,141,22,123,213,259,10,17,72,250,2,32,37,39,116,170,199,142,68,120,155,179,182,28,84,171,180,256,88,127,71,145,229,67,92,221,86,89,187,202,79,83,181,80,128,215,85,121,220,76,66,77,43,124,235,149,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The roaming icon uses a triangle to denote a secondary or different network, while the full signal icon uses a series of bars to indicate a strong connection to the primary network.","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[26,105,183,104,127,247,75,236,30,135,136,254,29,250,27,237,257,238,239,77,240,258,134,230,249,24,109,35,214,168,186,231,78,142,16,79,126,68,139,204,25,61,141,112,209,31,62,113,93,125,137,147,60,157,167,192,206,45,129,4,100,6,43,132,185,81,158,203,201,101,103,246,36,146,216,15,67,229,53,138,208,219,245,13,52,85,88,179,97,176,193,166,194,234,63,121,148,177,256,55,143,165,242,71,133,140,14,72,91,170,181,196,226,37,69,70,160,260,9,33,118,244,255,59,82,144,248,54,107,145,154,20,28,76,84,90,96,128,233,34,44,131,182,23,123,130,253,18,56,66,89,191,241,98,156,162,189,213,232,17,47,83,95,108,188,41,117,180,218,251,64,116,169,51,102,159,163,173,175,187,228,5,8,124,149,195,212,42,106,110,122,200,205,225,21,86,94,227,3,19,65,73,114,151,164,199,235,48,32,92,119,207,153,40,87,210,2,12,39,74,115,171,198,217,223,46,111,150,172,252,99,184,259,80,190,222,10,50,155,7,211,215,49,57,178,38,11,161,174,221,58,243,224,120,152,202,197,220,1,22],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1}]}

HDR is designed for high-contrast scenes, capturing multiple exposure levels to reveal detail in both bright and dark areas.  Action shots are too fast for HDR to capture the full range of light and dark details. Low-light conditions require flash or front camera use, which HDR is not optimized for.  Flash creates a single, bright exposure, while front cameras often have limited dynamic range, making HDR unnecessary and potentially detrimental to the photo quality.  Finally, HDR's focus on contrast can be distracting in portraits, especially when the subject is stationary, as it emphasizes the contrast between the subject and the background.\n","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,153,176,177,252,107,141,58,150,38,116,151,188,67,118,120,217,168,193,212,31,208,207,230,101,114,117,146,189,68,209,239,47,173,163,136,152,204,231,19,60,72,158,159,233,6,34,115,140,144,194,210,223,90,197,238,81,174,185,89,102,106,125,139,169,240,45,46,156,172,39,100,178,190,201,224,225,242,105,126,165,12,192,11,24,62,78,87,103,122,134,138,154,164,56,73,135,147,155,27,95,121,128,160,170,232,22,29,70,74,123,133,145,166,180,205,33,94,142,206,237,243,253,49,51,25,37,162,167,211,227,260,41,55,214,219,246,255,8,50,59,113,235,4,148,175,184,198,137,254,2,76,92,143,257,5,43,129,182,247,256,186,191,48,63,108,124,181,218,93,104,195,42,69,71,85,213,3,18,32,35,86,244,258,23,57,64,161,171,226,236,259,7,202,132,241,249,251,16,65,66,110,179,245,61,75,82,112,149,196,203,44,88,127,157,200,13,21,83,250,215,248,36,91,109,216,52,222,15,79,234,28,80,183,228,40,77,111,99,131,229,17,130,199,96,97,221,9,98,187,20,30,14,53,54,26,220,84,1,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The warning sound alerts you to the potential hazard, prompting you to take appropriate action to avoid a collision.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[424,363,446,333,426,441,442,352,425,427,269,439,332,354,359,115,331,361,391,428,440,443,350,360,390,438,290,330,349,137,335,344,346,351,353,365,366,433,127,200,270,355,431,116,286,289,398,282,362,372,432,540,609,133,314,334,342,345,410,429,430,434,436,437,156,337,347,371,408,422,423,444,496,99,139,142,150,265,280,283,291,324,364,392,402,413,414,417,474,56,57,64,81,104,122,152,190,276,329,376,447,456,472,108,110,112,114,165,166,175,245,259,287,327,367,373,386,388,406,452,508,526,531,107,124,129,132,145,148,176,178,185,275,295,305,325,356,378,385,412,419,445,478,529,155,174,179,182,192,281,316,336,338,348,357,377,382,403,457,491,52,65,135,138,183,186,199,274,277,303,389,396,404,407,411,421,565,23,69,83,93,181,213,218,235,249,260,266,271,284,292,296,302,323,358,397,416,435,451,465,494,506,507,524,538,543,617,30,58,66,80,82,84,85,144,151,153,177,188,219,273,285,297,301,311,328,415,418,420,455,471,490,528,542,41,63,70,73,103,146,230,236,238,240,243,251,253,272,279,293,306,313,318,381,383,463,467,473,541,577,578,586,13,44,46,49,60,95,106,111,128,159,161,184,223,244,252,262,326,370,374,375,468,612,8,35,37,86,87,113,131,147,189,206,222,227,255,264,307,315,454,466,481,523,527,530,546,579,583,585,618,20,31,45,47,67,71,72,79,90,125,130,141,211,232,248,278,343,400,405,453,470,475,522,570,580,39,42,59,89,126,143,162,168,180,187,196,242,246,261,304,310,341,380,393,401,450,469,476,521,571,572,581,608,613,614,616,17,36,88,119,158,233,237,294,312,340,479,486,548,549,38,40,48,61,68,105,220,247,267,368,369,395,477,480,532,547,109,117,191,195,204,229,241,387,394,489,544,553,43,94,123,149,164,208,210,257,339,487,495,560,121,170,228,379,409,567,568,33,54,100,120,203,299,448,552,573,55,97,154,201,226,321,499,539,550,98,118,157,169,171,512,234,300,458,533,563,3,9,74,91,136,197,212,215,587,16,163,172,239,263,615,101,384,483,537,92,167,224,225,449,492,493,569,11,62,308,464,514,18,32,134,193,198,205,216,497,534,554,102,503,559,10,29,288,525,574,576,51,160,221,250,482,498,558,564,600,28,76,268,298,575,231,582,24,50,207,516,557,595,194,214,319,556,21,53,254,500,26,75,209,509,519,596,77,399,460,520,535,584,599,34,322,536,601,78,501,511,518,217,258,202,461,589,502,515,517,566,15,462,2,4,6,25,96,256,320,485,588,598,606,610,620,12,593,603,7,22,459,562,561,590,27,604,619,1,488,545,484,597,140,173,309,5,19,555,317,594,505,605,551,504,592,602,513,591,510,14,611,607],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}
{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof rack's 100 kg (220 lbs) weight limit can lead to several safety risks.  Overloading can cause the roof rack to become unstable, potentially leading to a collapse during driving. This collapse could result in cargo falling off the roof, posing a risk to other road users and potentially damaging the vehicle itself.  Additionally, the increased weight could affect the vehicle's center of gravity, making it more susceptible to rollover accidents, especially at higher speeds or during sudden maneuvers.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, always distribute the load evenly across the crossbars and roof rack. Secure the cargo firmly to prevent movement.  Avoid carrying large, flat items like wood panels or mattresses, as they can be particularly unstable.  Drive slowly and cautiously when carrying cargo on the roof rack, especially in windy conditions.  Regularly check the cargo's securement before and during driving to ensure it hasn't shifted.  Finally, avoid driving at high speeds or making sharp turns, as these conditions can exacerbate the instability caused by excessive weight.

The cyclist's bicycle, made of material that doesn't reflect radar signals, can be a significant issue.  The system relies on radar and camera fusion for detection, and if the bicycle doesn't reflect radar waves, it won't be detected.  Additionally, if the cyclist is suddenly cut off or changes lanes, the system might not have enough time to react.  The system also has difficulty detecting a cyclist if they are moving very quickly, are short or in a low posture, have impaired mobility, or are moving in a direction intersecting with the vehicle's path.  Finally, if the cyclist is wearing clothing that blends into the background or is difficult to distinguish from similar structures, the system might have trouble identifying them.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[339,343,340,341,342,337,335,344,330,336,325,329,332,331,333,200,334,199,324,391,327,326,338,405,385,374,412,186,379,445,328,401,321,347,414,370,614,608,375,384,393,357,358,430,441,353,349,411,443,431,185,426,444,446,429,616,350,355,378,390,367,377,428,425,323,424,356,359,427,363,362,352,442,354,410,351,403,395,192,413,439,456,361,434,612,617,452,383,392,436,457,609,365,396,402,438,433,440,171,294,360,376,420,435,116,295,455,613,348,366,373,381,408,432,80,115,191,418,437,386,394,458,554,398,83,91,138,322,369,382,404,423,453,241,345,364,372,32,82,124,188,292,314,397,56,182,346,18,81,388,399,407,409,36,69,139,162,289,293,389,421,52,92,114,128,131,137,155,159,190,211,400,406,422,447,454,68,75,86,156,219,227,240,269,286,371,450,42,64,74,133,158,180,194,252,290,448,451,489,494,560,569,31,184,196,203,205,251,291,304,568,578,20,63,85,144,178,229,233,303,416,417,90,127,223,228,254,274,279,281,315,540,543,553,33,72,97,161,175,213,221,230,232,253,498,508,522,582,23,65,84,106,170,497,523,531,564,579,142,153,189,204,280,415,493,530,552,600,28,35,48,98,150,179,187,208,243,247,255,259,275,287,302,380,474,70,160,169,177,224,244,249,305,387,465,478,615,25,34,49,99,113,119,126,151,157,163,166,260,283,285,460,466,472,473,532,535,559,39,45,46,87,94,148,176,193,206,261,266,272,449,483,495,538,43,117,118,132,145,152,201,212,237,242,245,265,298,461,27,30,66,76,93,108,121,167,174,235,276,284,299,481,507,571,44,71,73,130,135,140,141,143,154,183,214,231,270,273,296,297,368,419,459,479,496,525,526,79,107,136,271,278,282,307,310,311,469,470,471,548,583,601,9,21,26,54,67,105,112,129,181,220,234,248,313,462,477,499,8,38,55,122,197,216,238,239,246,476,506,529,539,575,586,587,618,40,41,50,57,95,111,146,198,222,264,301,490,500,509,577,3,10,13,16,47,149,172,236,463,491,537,60,101,103,110,120,123,202,210,225,250,288,300,316,464,512,528,550,5,78,88,89,102,104,218,277,312,468,475,515,542,544,549,557,563,570,576,585,58,59,62,77,100,209,215,217,306,533,565,37,109,195,308,485,486,518,520,572,168,207,257,262,263,467,480,482,534,556,580,134,513,527,595,17,29,51,125,147,226,317,318,514,541,574,619,521,524,581,61,511,558,567,53,165,268,319,11,487,546,173,488,492,519,547,573,596,598,502,517,24,566,584,484,599,14,551,267,555,22,602,258,562,597,501,1,590,12,605,545,503,516,589,164,536,603,505,561,593,594,604,504,19,309,591,15,2,4,6,96,256,320,588,606,610,620,7,607,592,611,510],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

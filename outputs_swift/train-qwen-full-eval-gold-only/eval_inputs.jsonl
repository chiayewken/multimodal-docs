{"query": "Context:\n\nAbstract\nIn this dissertation, we investigate the issue of robust localization in swarms of heteroge-\nneous mobile agents with multiple and time-varying sensing modalities. Our focus is the\ndevelopment of filter-based and decoupled estimators under the assumption that agents\npossess communication and processing capabilities.\nIn the beginning, we study the filter-based Collaborative State Estimation (CSE) on\na networked system model and propose a novel and approximation-based algorithm for\nDistribued CSE (DCSE). Then, we apply our insights from DCSE, to address the problem\nof modularity and scalability in multi-sensor fusion on a single agent. We demonstrate suc-\ncessfully that filter decoupling strategies originating from CSE can be applied to decouple\nthe state of an individual agent, leading to a truly modular estimation framework. In total,\nthree different strategies originating in the domain of DCSE were applied and compare\nthem against a state-of-the-art approach. In evaluations, we show that our proposed ap-\nproach, is scaling best with the number of sensors and outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproach in terms of accuracy. We underline that the application of our CSE-inspired\nmethod in such a context breaks the computational barrier. Otherwise, it would, for the\nsake of complexity-reduction, prohibit the use of all available information or would lead\nto significant estimator inconsistencies due to coarse approximations.\nThe modular fusion approaches allow us to revisit indoor localization using ranging de-\nvices and to incorporate fully-meshed, tightly-coupled range measurements. Being able to\nconsider range measurements between the stationary ranging devices, allows us to improve\nthe self-calibration of those devices and to improve the estimation accuracy.\nBased on the findings from DCSE and modular sensor fusion, we propose a novel\nKalman filter decoupling paradigm, which is termed Isolated Kalman Filtering (IKF).\nThis paradigm is formally discussed and the treatment of delayed measurement is studied.\nThe impact of approximation made was investigated on different observation graphs and\nthe filter credibility was evaluated on a linear system in a Monte Carlo simulation.\nFinally, we propose multi-agent modular sensor fusion approach based on the IKF\nparadigm, in order to cooperatively estimate the global state of a multi-agent system in\na distributed way and fuse information provided by different on-board sensors in a com-\nputationally efficient way. As a consequence, this approach can be performed distributed\namong agents, while (i) communication between agents is only required at the moment of\ninter-agent joint observations, (ii) one agent acts as interim master to process state cor-\nrections isolated, (iii) agents can be added and removed from the swarm, (iv) each agent\u2019s\nfull state can vary during mission (each local sensor suite can be truly modular), and (v)\ndelayed and multi-rate sensor updates are supported.\nExtensive evaluation on realistic simulated and real-world data sets show that the\nproposed Isolated Kalman Filtering (IKF) paradigm, is applicable for both, truly modular\nsingle agent estimation and distributed collaborative multi-agent estimation problems. By\nproviding detailed pseudocode for each approach and a source code for the IKF paradigm,\nwe hope to pave the way towards generic plug-and-play systems for challenging real-world\nand multi-agent applications.\nix\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the key advantages of the proposed Isolated Kalman Filtering (IKF) paradigm in multi-agent modular sensor fusion, and how does it address the challenges of communication and computational efficiency in distributed systems?", "response": "", "images": []}

It is observed\nthat the most frequently recurring loss function sub-structure is the use of the subtraction\nor multiplication operator, with arguments y and f\u03b8(x). This result is expected as these\nare commonly used building blocks in loss functions for computing the error in regression\nand classification, respectively. There is also high usage of the square root and square\noperators, which are commonly used for scaling the effects of large and small errors to ei-\nther penalize or discount different groups of predictions (i.e. inliers and outliers). Finally,\nthere is minimal usage of the sign, min, and tanh operators, which empirically suggests\nthat these function nodes are seldom important to the design of learned loss functions and\nthat future studies may wish to consider removing them from the function set to increase\nthe search efficiency.\n3.6\nChapter Summary\nThis chapter presents a new framework for meta-learning symbolic loss function via a\nhybrid neuro-symbolic search approach called Evolved Model-Agnostic Loss (EvoMAL).\nThe proposed technique uses genetic programming to learn a set of expression tree-based\nloss functions, which are subsequently transformed into gradient-trainable loss networks\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What insight can be drawn from the relative frequencies of binary operators compared to unary operators in the symbolic loss functions discovered by EvoMAL, and how might this inform future improvements to the algorithm's search space or efficiency?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/1952fb7c775338e559eabb6d55f8855b.png"]}

Secondly, LACE is not smooth as shown in Figure 4.5 when transitioning\nbetween minimizing and maximizing the target output.\nConsequently, this can cause\ntraining to become unstable, disrupting the learning process and negatively affecting the\ngeneralization of the base model.\nIn the following section, we apply our findings and\ndiscoveries from the absolute cross-entropy loss to propose a new loss function that resolves\nboth of these issues while maintaining the key properties of LACE, specifically, its constant\ntime and space complexity due to target-only loss computation.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Given the t-SNE visualizations of penultimate layer representations in Figure 4.7, what can be inferred about the relationship between inter-class separation and generalization performance in image classification?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/5121d5552626d864f7043627911e7e55.png"]}

The salient differences\nare as follows:\n\u2022 Prior work in (Gonzalez & Miikkulainen, 2020b) uses unprotected operations: nat-\nural logarithm (log(x)), square root (\u221ax), and division (x1/x2). Using these un-\nprotected operations can result in imaginary or undefined output violating the GP\nclosure property. To satisfy the closure property, we replace both the natural log and\nsquare root with protected alternatives, as well as replace the division operator with\nthe analytical quotient (AQ) operator, a smooth and differentiable approximation\nto the division operator (Ni et al., 2012).\n\u2022 Our proposed search space for meta-learning loss functions is both task and model-\nagnostic in contrast to (Liu et al., 2020b) and (Li et al., 2022b), which use multiple\naggregation-based and element-wise operations in the function set. These operations\nare suitable for object detection (the respective paper\u2019s target domain) but are not\ncompatible when applied to other tasks such as tabulated and natural language pro-\ncessing problems.

It is important to mention that a single usability inspector \nperformed each usability inspection. It took three authors about 130 hours each to analyze a total \nof 508 comments.

The kappa (k) overall value \nwas observed as 0.87, i.e., almost a perfect agreement. Subsection 6.3.1 discusses in detail the \nanalysis of usability inspection reports. A total of 209 issues were uniquely reported, out of which \n177 issues were reported by expert heuristic usability inspection and 121 issues by novice crowd \nusability inspection with an overlap of 98 issues (47%). The results contain 32 critical issues and \n69 serious issues. An overview of the results is shown in table 10.3. The overlap ratio of the unique \nproblems between novice crowd inspection and expert heuristic inspection for the first trial of the \nexperiment, i.e., 54% (46 out of 85 unique issues), was higher compared to the second trial overlap \nratio, i.e., 39% (25 out 64 unique issues) and third trial overlap ratio, i.e., 45% (27 out of 60 unique \nissues) of the experiment.

First, let\u2019s consider the easiest case with \u03b7 = 0, \u03b2POS = \u03b2NEG = 1,\nand \u03bd = 0. Recall that h\u2217is the pair of classifiers used to generate the labels.\nWhen \u03b7 = 0, h\u2217is a perfect classifier for both groups so Equal Opportunity\nis trivially satisfied.

In\nour Chapter 3 studies, we generated diverse conversational content (a factor of verbal cues).\nSpecifically, we used the crowd to produce messaging that are both efficacious (motivational\nand informative) and that incorporate diverse verbal cues. In our Chapter 4 studies, we\ninvestigated what can make messaging more effective (in terms of user perceptions and\nself-disclosure) by varying the conversational style (i.e., language formality) of a health\nchatbots. Finally, in our Chapter 5 study, we investigated what can make messaging more\neffective (in terms of user perceptions and privacy concerns) by varying the format (both\nconversational style and conversational content) a health chatbot can use when referencing\na user\u2019s utterances from previous chatting sessions.\nBelow we will describe how the three chapters highlight the importance of how a com-\nputer communicates with its users, as well as provide discussion on additional insights not\ncontained in a chapter\u2019s respective discussion sections, and potential future work.\n6.1\nGenerating and maintaining diverse content - LLMs\nor the crowd?\nChapter 3, emphasised the importance of health messaging that adopts a wide range of\nthemes (with our Directed Diversity method producing collections of messages that were\nseen as less repetitive), while still maintaining more abstract human concepts such as how\nmotivational a message is found to be. These more abstract concepts may require human in-\nput or feedback (such as labelled datasets and example utterances, or reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) [347]) to ensure that computer-delivered messaging systems\ncan reply appropriately. Additionally, LLMs require a flow of example utterances (such as\npurposely crowd-sourced content, or extracted online content) to keep up to date with chang-\ning cultural references, slang, humour and language style. Prompt engineering and human\njudgement could also be used to produce and provide feedback on the appropriateness of\nresponses [35] (such as asking GPT-4 to write and evaluate its own message - see Figure 1.8\nin [35]).\nIn recent work, Karinshak et al. [159] used GPT-3 to generate messages to encourage\npeople to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Subsequently, crowd-workers found that messages\ngenerated by GPT-3 were more persuasive than those from the CDC.

Figure 2.2 shows that 50% of all Bitcoin\ntransactions were added to the blockchain in just 3 years. Similarly, in Ethereum, 80% of\nthe transactions were added in just 1.5 years. Users typically issue transactions using a\nwallet software, whose primary functionality is determining an \u201cappropriate\u201d fee for\na given transaction. This (prioritization) fee varies, unsurprisingly, as a function of the\nlevel of congestion in the blockchain (Messias et al., 2021) as well as the distribution\nof fees across available transactions. Inferring either of these is, however, deceptively\ncomplicated.\nAt first glance, these tasks appear straightforward, since every transaction is broad-\ncast to all miners in the blockchain. A user could simply gather all transactions broadcast\nover time and reconstruct the set of uncommitted transactions available to a miner (i.e.,\ncontents of the miner\u2019s Mempool) at any point of time (Messias et al., 2020). We refer to\nthis assumption of a public and uniform view (across miners) of all available transactions\nas contention transparency. If contention transparency exists, a user could rank order\n7One Bitcoin (BTC) is equal to 108 satoshi (sat).\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What can be inferred about the relationship between the rate of transaction issuance and the rate of block mining in the Bitcoin blockchain, and how does this relate to the concept of contention transparency?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/de28e4c1370c450227e8d453e94f04ad.png", "data/qwen_images/5459e4f8a3050b46b7c1e98640436cab.png", "data/qwen_images/52942cc4b2bcc8f4df7e67a80758a119.png"]}

The main objective of these experiments was to\nevaluate the lack of transparency in transaction contention and prioritization.\nIn summary, our findings indicate that private transactions and private relay net-\nworks are quite prevalent in both Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains. Flashbots, in\nparticular, is extensively used in Ethereum, accounting for a significant portion of 99.99%\nof the total Ethereum hash rate. It also enables arbitrageurs to exploit MEV opportunities\nby bundling their private transactions with public transactions like oracle updates or\ntaking advantage of sandwich attacks. Similarly, in Bitcoin, miners offer transaction\nacceleration services, allowing users to privately offer a dark-fee to incentivize miners for\na faster commit time. Through active experiments, we show that miners highly prioritize\nthese transactions, on average including them in 1.8 blocks, with a range of 1 to 3 blocks.\nWorrisome, we uncover evidence of collusion among miners with a combined hash rate\nexceeding 50% to ensure the inclusion of these dark-fee transactions.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What potential concern arises from the combined hash rates of the mining pools shown in the table, and how might this impact the Bitcoin network?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/279626d5619f1ec513b96932e1ab8f5e.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\nClaim 43. The class of local rational semigroup transductions that are future\nindependent (see Definition 31) is equal to the class of local semigroup transac-\ntions.\nProof. We start the proof by observing that a rational transduction is future\nindependent if and only if for every x, a, y, y\u2032, it holds that:\n\u03bb(x, a, y) = \u03bb(x, a, y\u2032)\nWith this observation, we are ready to prove the claim. The \u2286inclusion is\neasy: In order to transform a local semigroup transduction into a local rational\nsemigroup transduction, we can use the following output function:\n\u03bb\u2032(x, a, y) = \u03bb(x \u00b7 h(a))\nIt is easy to see that \u03bb\u2032 is future independent. Moreover, locality of \u03bb implies\nthe locality of \u03bb\u2032. This is because if y1\u00b7h(a)\u00b7y2 = e, then y1\u00b7h(a) is a prefix of e.\nThe proof of \u2287is similar. The main difference is that we need to define\nanother semigroup S\u2032 that keeps track of the last letter of a word. We define it\nas S\u2032 = (S + 1) \u00d7 \u03a3 with the following operation:\n(x1, a1) \u00b7 (x2, a2) = (x1 \u00b7 h(a1) \u00b7 x2, a2)\nNow, we define h\u2032(a) = (1, a) and \u03bb\u2032((x, a)) = \u03bb(x, a, \u22a3) (or \u03bb(\u22a2, a, \u22a3) if x = 1).\nThanks to the future independence of \u03bb, we know that (S\u2032, h\u2032, \u03bb\u2032) defines the\nsame function as (S, h, \u03bb). Moreover, using a similar idea as in the proof of \u2286,\nwe can show that \u03bb\u2032 satisfies the locality equation.\n3.7.1\nRational Krohn-Rhodes decompositions\nIn this section, we formulate and prove a version of the Krohn-Rhodes theorem\nfor local semigroup transductions. Observe that all classical prime functions (see\nTheorem 7) and single-use prime functions (see Theorem 8) except for the ho-\nmomorphisms are left-to-right oriented. The rational version of Krohn-Rhodes\ntheorem extends the set of prime functions with their right-to-left counterparts.\nLet us start with the classical version of the theorem for finite alphabets19:\nTheorem 13. The class of rational transductions (over finite alphabets) is equal\nto the smallest class closed under \u25e6and \u00d7, that contains the following rational\nprime functions:\n1.

The system is able to identify the error, and point out\nthat a syllable needs to be deleted. However, we can see that the system points\nto an incorrect syllable \u0938\u094d\u0924to be deleted. This can be explained from the fact\nthat both \u0938\u094d\u0924and \u0924are laghu letters, and deletion of either letter results in the\ncorrect metrical signature. So, it is impossible for a meter identification based\nsystem to correctly say which character is to be deleted without any notion of\nsemantic consideration. Such type of semantic error correction is out-of-scope\nas of yet.\nMajority of the \u2018errors\u2019 in GRETIL stem from the presence of a whitespace in the\ntext at the joining point of sandhi. For example, the text \u092e\u0947\u0918\u092e\u093e\u0228\u01f5\u01f8\u0938\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0902is written as two\nwords (\u092e\u0947\u0918\u092e\u094d\u0906\u0228\u01f5\u01f8\u0938\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0902), which if considered as is, would make the second syllable of\nthe phrase \u0918\u092e\u094d(guru) instead of \u0918(laghu). Despite not being linguistic errors, from the\npoint of view of Chanda\u1e25\u015b\u0101stra, they may change the number of syllables in a p\u0101da\nand subsequently result in the change or loss of the meter. Such errors can be fixed\nby ignoring the spaces while computing the metrical signature.\nIt is important to remember that the errors detected are only the errors reported\nby the Chandoj\u00f1\u0101nam system. Errors that do not result in the breaking of metrical\npattern are impossible to be corrected by metrical analysis. It is interesting to note\nthat the fuzzy matching performs better for Google OCR than Tesseract OCR. It can\nbe explained as follows. As the Google OCR system performs better and makes fewer\nerrors per line, the possible deviations are fewer. This results in less false positives.\nOn the contrary, if the OCR system makes numerous errors, the lg-signature is farther\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Given the error analysis results, what inherent limitations of meter identification systems might lead to undetected errors in Sanskrit texts, even with a high error tolerance rate?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/d5674aab168573be89b5406076fef0d0.png"]}

We found that participants\u2019 data, in all cases where participants \nshowed an appropriate adaptive response, was consistent with this prediction or close to its confidence interval \nbounds, as expected from our simulations with finite sample size. Moreover, we found that the exponentiated \nerror averaged over the path probabilities was statistically compatible with unity for these participants, in line \nwith Jarzynski\u2019s theorem.\nTogether these results not only extend the experimental evidence of Boltzmann-like relationships between \nthe probabilities of behavior and the corresponding order-inducing functions\u2014such as energy, utility, or sen-\nsorimotor error\u2014from the equilibrium to the non-equilibrium domain, but also from simple physical systems \nto more complex learning systems when studying adaptation in changing environments, deepening, thus, the \nparallelism between thermodynamics in physics and decision-making \u00ad\nsystems31.\nWhen testing for the validity of thermodynamic relations, one of the most critical issues is the choice of the \nenergy function, that is, in our case, the error cost function.

There are three concepts relevant to this algorithm: U, \nq and \u03b1\u200a\n.

In our case we define the density \nfunction in y with \n\u001f 90\n\u221290 q(x, y)dy = 1\u200a\n, as we assume that movements will be towards the target (\u200a\n0\u25e6 direction) \nunder a maximally induced error of 20\u25e6\u200a\n.

Thus, p is the stationary distribution of the resulting \nMarkov process, and so the xi can be regarded samples from p after the chain has passed a transient stage after \nwhich the effect of the initialization is negligible. Notice, in our implementation, described below, we only \nrequire the burn-in phase for the initial energy in order to make sure that the process starts in the correspond-\ning stationary state.

{"query": "Context:\n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Conclusion\n5.4\nConclusion\nThis work belongs to the study of uncertainty, which is key in several scientific\ndisciplines. In particular, we have taken a coarse-grained approach to uncer-\ntainty reduction, equating it to decision-making. This has led us to a somewhat\nunified treatment where we addresses through the lens of order theory several\nphenomena like learning, optimization, thermodynamics and computation.\nAs a starting point, we considered the importance of uncertainty in the con-\ntemporary study of learning systems via bounded rationality with information-\nprocessing constraints. In this regard, we developed the uncertainty framework\nthat deals with learning systems further. More specifically, we went beyond the\nusual study of optimization using uncertainty tools and improved on the relation\nbetween non-optimal learning and optimization by clarifying the applicability of\nfluctuation theorems on learning systems, which we then tested in the context\nof human sensorimotor learning. This part of our work is motivated by the long\nterm goal of understanding how biological systems adapt efficiently in order to\nimplement similar mechanisms in artificial intelligence.\nThe following issue we addressed was that of uncertainty measurement. In\nparticular, we noticed that the intuitive uncertainty picture given by the order\nstructure known as majorization is usually abandoned in favor of some function\nlike Shannon entropy, as one can see in both thermodynamics and the study of\nlearning systems. This led us to question how transitions from an order struc-\nture to real-valued functions take place. Our original interest was focused on\nthe existence of optimization principles that somewhat generalize the properties\nof the maximum entropy principle. To this end, we introduced injective mono-\ntones and related them to other properties of order structures. After that, we\nconsidered the substitution of order structures by real-valued functions more\nin general. In particular, we developed interest in measuring the complexity of\norder structures and its relation to optimization on them. This led us to estab-\nlishing the classification of preorders in terms of real-valued monotones and to\nthe definition of the Debreu dimension as a bridge between the different notions\nof complexity (or order dimension) we encountered in the literature. This ab-\nstract approach to uncertainty in terms of order monotones proved to be useful\nin concrete scenarios where uncertainty is key. In particular, it enabled us to\ngain insight into both the maximum entropy principle and the complexity of\nthe approach to molecular diffusion known as the principle of increasing mixing\ncharacter. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to the uncertainty-based\nquantum resource theories, as we briefly pointed out. This part of our work was\nconcerned with the general issue of how the set of transitions of a system can be\ncaptured by functions, which is a fundamental research question in several areas\nof knowledge, like thermodynamics, general relativity, quantum physics, utility\ntheory and others. More specifically, this part of our work is also inscribed in\nthe study of appropriate notions of information, where the substitution of an\n(intuitive) order-theoretic model by functions is commonplace.\nOnce we concluded our research regarding uncertainty measurement and its\nabstractions, we returned to the fundamental idea of uncertainty as an order\n124\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here is a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nHow does the author's approach to uncertainty connect different scientific disciplines, and what specific contributions does this work make to our understanding of learning systems and uncertainty measurement?

In the above, for an n-bit string x we define [x]i =\n(x1, x2, . . . , xi), [x]i:j = (xi+1, . . . , xj), and [x]j: = (xj+1, . . . , xn).\nThe above protocol obtains very short output compared to entropy of W, whereas\nideally we would like to obtain something close to entropy of W. If Alice and Bob\nhave access to uniform randomness, one can extend this protocol to output almost as\nmany bits as W\u2019s entropy (see Figure 4.2). After the execution of the [11] protocol\nwe have the additional guarantee (see proof of Theorem 6, point (b)) that if SA \u0338= \u22a5\nand SB \u0338= \u22a5then we know that SA = SB and are close to uniform and moreover\nEve did not tamper with W of either of the parties (this is only achieved with\nstandard notion of non-malleability, not the one from [105]). If Alice and Bob have\naccess to some extra uniform bits (if A and B were uniform to start with then we\ncould cut them in half A = A1 \u25e6A2 and B = B1 \u25e6B2, use the first half to run the\noriginal protocol by [11] and save the other half for later) then we can continue the\nprotocol (in the spirit of [79]): Alice will send A2, \u03c3A to Bob, where \u03c3A is a Message\nAutentication Code of A2 with first half of SA as a key. Bob will do the same: send\nB2, \u03c3B to Alice using other half of SB as a MAC key. There is a one final problem,\nwe know that one of A2 or B2 is uniform but we don\u2019t know which (Eve could have\nleft W unchanged but could have tampered with random coins A and B), moreover\none of them might depend on W. Notice that A2 and B2 will remain independent,\nand one of them is independent of W and uniform. Therefore A2 + B2 is uniform\nand independent of W. Now all we have to do is plug in W and A2 + B2 into seeded\nextractor SExt(W, A2 + B2) and we can extract almost whole entropy out of W\n(and the output remains hidden from the view of Eve).\n97\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Explain the role of the 2NMExt function in the privacy amplification protocol illustrated in Figure 4.1, and discuss how it ensures the security of the shared secret between Alice and Bob in the presence of an active adversary.", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/3e446ff3036f0c91c6945032ffa7998c.png"]}

Then, we simulate the CP process 861 times over the\ndataset for \ud835\udf0c= 1. In each run and bin \ud835\udc5b, we count: (i) the number of transitions that\nhave occurred and (ii) the sum total of effective forwards, while the number of total shares\nbelongs to that bin. These two entries are accumulated bin-wise over 861 viral sample\npaths. For each bin, we divide the effective forwards by the number of transitions, which\nrepresents the estimated TeF curve (see solid black curve in Fig. 5.3(i)).\nWe repeat the above routine for \ud835\udf0c= 0.4, 0.6 as well, and the corresponding estimates\nof \ud835\udc5a(\u00b7) are plotted in Fig. 5.3(i) after dividing by the respective \ud835\udf0cvalues.

Towards this, we propose an algorithm which\ndirectly learns the parameters of the WM, \ud835\udc4fand \ud835\udc64.

This design is helpful for\nefficiency optimization by allowing a large detection stride \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61. When later applied for activity\nrecognition, the bounding box can be further enlarged for a fixed rate \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc59to include spatial\ncontext and compensate for missed tracks.\n1.3.3\nProposal Filtering\nFor now, the proposal generation pipeline applies a frame-wise object detection with slight aid\nof tracking information. The motion information of video is not yet explored. To produce high\nquality proposals, we apply a proposal filtering algorithm to eliminate the proposals that are\nunlikely to contain activities.\nForeground segmentation.\nFor each proposal, a foreground segmentation algorithm is im-\nplemented to generate a binary mask for every \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc54frames for each video clip. We average the\nvalue of pixel masks in its cube to get its foreground score \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56.

We first convert the annotation of activity instances into the cube format,\ndenoted as ground truth cubes, by performing dense sampling of duration \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5dand stride \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\nwithin each instance. For each proposal, we estimate the spatial intersection-over-union (IoU)\nbetween it and ground truth cubes in the same temporal window.

We use a simplified BEVT pre-training setup\nto test the effectiveness of our video tokens as targets for masked modeling. The main difference\nis that we drop the image-stream from pre-training and only use the video stream and for this\nreason, we also drop the multiple decoders completely and adopt an encoder-only architecture\nsimilar to BEiT.

UniFormer is built upon\nBERT [49] and utilizes its tokenizer and pretrained weights. The input for each token consists\nof a text embedding and a 1D position embedding for p.\nFollowing LayoutLM [231], we add 2D position embeddings \ud835\udc650, \ud835\udc660, \ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc661, \ud835\udc64, \u210e, where \ud835\udc64=\n\ud835\udc651 \u2212\ud835\udc650 and \u210e= \ud835\udc661 \u2212\ud835\udc660. These embeddings are used to represent the spatial location of each\ntoken. All the embeddings mentioned above are obtained from trainable lookup tables.\nFollowing LayoutLMv2 [230], UniFormer adopts relative position-aware self-attention lay-\ners by adding biases to the attention scores according to relative 1D locations \u25b3p and relative\n2D locations \u25b3\ud835\udc650+\ud835\udc651\n2 , \u25b3\ud835\udc660+\ud835\udc661\n2 .\nImage Crop Input\nTo model visual information, we add a crop embedding by linearly pro-\njecting the flattened pixels in the image crop, following ViT [52].

Big Data Quality Anomaly Detection Framework \nThis section introduces a framework for detecting data quality anomalies using an extended \nisolation forest model for anomaly identification. The core concept behind anomaly detection \nrevolves around identifying irregularities within the data that deviate significantly from the \nexpected patterns. In this subsequent section, we propose an advanced predictive anomaly \ndetection model that proactively identifies potential data quality issues, focusing on ensuring \nhigh-quality Big Data. Notably, this model possesses the capacity for continuous improvement \nthrough exposure to additional data, making it especially effective at identifying emerging data \nquality anomalies or evolving patterns over time. The main idea behind this framework \ninvolves reformatting the dataset to reveal hidden anomalies associated with each metric, \nhighlighting their divergence from the dataset's statistical norms. Within this framework, the \ndataset transforms various patterns, each of which uncovers anomalies related to a quality \nmetric, rendering them discernible in terms of their values and, consequently, easily \ndetectable. The data quality framework consists of four primary phases. The initial \npreprocessing phase focuses on cleansing and preparing the raw data for the anomaly \ndetection model. Subsequently, the data is structured and molded into multiple patterns, with \neach pattern highlighting the quality anomalies associated with a specific quality metric in the \nform of aberrant values, thus facilitating their detection. These resultant patterns are then \nattributed to the anomaly detection model, which relies on an advanced isolation forest model \nto pinpoint anomalies linked to each quality metric. Finally, the model computes an anomaly \nquality score for each anomaly identified, ultimately deriving an anomaly score for each metric \nand an overall anomaly score for the entire dataset.

Other slicing parameters, such as those that create geometry\nthat is removed after fabrication (e.g., those related to support material or build plate\nadhesion) are less suitable.\nHowever, for special materials, such as wood filaments, the shade of the object\u2019s color can\nbe altered by varying the speed and temperature, which could be used to create differences\namong instances: the hotter or slower the extruder, the more the wood particles burn and\nthe darker the resulting surface (Figure 5-17). However, since the changes affect the objects\nappearance, we do not consider them for our work.\nFigure 5-17: The hotter the nozzle, the darker the print\u2019s finish.\n5.9.2\nRotational Symmetry of Outlines\nSince we use the outline of objects to extract the orientation of features, objects whose\nbases are rotationally symmetric are less suitable for our approach. Thus, the number of\nidentifiable angles is reduced for certain shapes, e.g., for a square base, the range narrows\ndown from 0\u00b0-180\u00b0 to 0\u00b0-90\u00b0.\n110\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the temperature variation in the 3D printing process, as shown in Figure 5-17, affect the appearance of the printed object, and what implications might this have for the identification and verification of 3D printed objects?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/74736ac017481d0d73030ef2e439643a.png"]}

In comparison to other types of tags,\nwe can say that these parameter spaces have a larger code capacity than a 1D barcode with\n7 or 14 bits, respectively.\n5.5.6\nCross-Validation\nTo cross-validate our parameter spacing, we printed another random set of 16 objects (10\nlarge, 6 medium) from the same top 50 model list from Thingiverse (excluding the ones\nwe used in the previous experiment) with white filament. Before printing, we randomly\nassigned each model a combination of slicing settings from the available parameter space\nand then tested if G-ID can identify them. Our second goal was to see if the parameter\nspacing still applies when multiple parameters are varied at the same time (our previous\nexperiment only varied one slicing parameter per instance at a time).

In total, the detection accuracy is\n93.75%.

We laser cut the 4 unmodified and 4 modified hinges of each size (16\nhinges in total) from 3mm birch plywood sheets. The messages embedded in the modified\nones were produced using a random string generator. While different hinge designs may\nexhibit different flexibility [39], we use the default pattern generated by kyub as this is the\ntool we used for fabricating our application samples.\nExperiment procedure\nTo evaluate the bending angle, we bent the living hinge pattern\neither up to 180\u2218(maximum) or up to the point where it started cracking, and then read\nthe corresponding maximum angle from a protractor as shown in Figure 4-10b.\nResults\nFor the larger hinge, we found that both the unmodified and modified hinge were\nable to bend to 180\u2218(Table 4.2). Thus, the change did not impact the performance. This\nis likely because the cut distance is not a main factor impacting the maximum hinge bend\nangle, which is rather directly linked to the the sheet thickness and the number of links\nin series [39]. For the smaller hinge, the unmodified hinge was also able to bend to the\nmaximum of 180\u2218, whereas the modified hinge was still able to bend to 175\u2218(i.e., a decrease\nonly 2.8% after the insertion of the code).

Rather than simply thresholding the distance matrix, which\nreplaces a geometrical summary with a topological summary, we explore transforms that can\nsuppress variations among small distances (which tend to be dominated by noise) and among large\ndistances (which may not reflect mutual information between the two variables), while preserving\ngeometrical information (which may boost sensitivity to simple relationships). We refer to these\ntransforms as geo-topological transforms, because they combine aspects of geometry and topology.\nDepending on the choice of the lower and upper bounds, these transforms can threshold (lower\nbound l = upper bound u) at arbitrary levels, adapting to the granularity of the dependency present\nin a data set. They can also, optionally, preserve geometrical information (lower bound l < upper\nbound u).\n70\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Which statistical test demonstrates the highest average statistical power for detecting sinusoidal relationships, and how does its performance compare to the test with the lowest average statistical power for the same relationship?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/4a04dc2b3137fa9d62f2ddda8bd16861.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\nintroduction and guide on how to apply TDA to data science and understand its results; [165] is a\ngentle introduction and tutorial to the computation of persistent homology.\nThe single-cell topological data analysis (scTDA) is one of the first attempts to apply topology-\nbased computational analyses to study temporal, unbiased transcriptional regulation given the\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing data [64]. In order to visualize the most invariant features of the\nentire gene expression data, scTDA clusters low-dispersion genes with significant gene connectivity\naccording to their centroid in the topological representation, and visualize the data points in low-\ndimension space with the Mapper algorithm [166]. Computing the library complexity as the number\nof genes whose expression is detected in a cell, scTDA observes a mild dependence of library\ncomplexity over the timescale of the single cell data of 1,529 cells collected at 5 time points. This is\nexpected because the number of genes expressed by cells in early stages of a developmental process\nis larger than in the adult case, as pointed out in [167]. As a result, in scTDA the library complexity\nis not used for any purpose at the topological data analysis and not related to any topological\nproperties.\nIntuitively thinking, if we were to introduce a definition for \u201ccell complexity\u201d, that characterizes\nthe behaviors of cell-cell coexpression or interactions, the quantities of cell complexity should be\nagnostic to the number of genes expressed by the cells, and should be different across differentiated\ncells and across the developmental process. Can we introduce a better summary statistic for the\ncell complexity that can capture the developmental trajectory with more distinctions between time\npoints? To clarify, unlike the previous definition of \u201clibrary complexity\u201d, which simply quantifies\nthe number of genes expressed in a cell, we wish to define a cell complexity measure to better model\nhigher-order networks and dynamic interactions in single-cell data. Understanding the cell-cell\ninteractions can help identify intercellular signaling pathways and previous analytical studies have\nfocused on computing a communication score between the ligand\u2013receptor pair of interacting\nproteins [168]. For instance, [169] and [170] infer the intercellular signaling pathways of cell-cell\ncommunications by computing the coexpression of all genes or other cell markers. The alternative\nwould be to compute the similarity between gene expression profiles as in [171].

Especially in cross-dataset prediction, the fine-tuning\nof the latent features in an end-to-end CNN-LSTM leads to further improvement. This\ncould be due to the fact that more data, i.e., the complete lab data set, were available\nfor the training, hence fine-tuning, than in the case of the within the prediction. When\nemploying latent features, the use of temporal (i.e., LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, CNN-\nBiLSTM) models, allows for a small improvement of prediction performance compared to\nnon-temporal classifiers (i.e., SVM, XGB, DNN) (Figure A.3.5, 2nd row), especially in the\ncross-dataset prediction.\nFigure A.3.6 shows the confusion matrices for within- and cross-dataset mind wandering\nprediction of the fine-tuned CNN-BiLSTM model, as well as precision-recall curves for both\nprediction scenarios.

In conclusion, automated annotation of hand-\nraisings needs to be student specific and methodologically robust for real-world classroom\nscenarios. Therefore, we propose a recognition approach based on pose estimation trained\nand tested on a challenging dataset containing real-world school lessons with realistic\nhand-raising behaviors, representing a wide range of age groups (grades 5 to 12) and school\nsubjects. Furthermore, our approach copes with the main technical challenges of such\nvideos, such as camera angles and occlusions of students. To tackle those, we adapted and\nextended state-of-the-art view-invariant, occlusion-robust pose embeddings. Going beyond\nrelated works which detected hand-raising in a frame-by-frame fashion, we developed a\nclassification model which integrates temporal information and is thus able to capture the\nlarge variety of hand-raisings expressed in their dynamic process.\nC.1.4.

A total of 127 students, 56.3% male, from grades\n5 to 12 were videotaped during 36 lessons across a wide variety of subjects (see Table C.1).\nAll recordings were captured by cameras (24 frames per second) mounted in the front left\nor right corner of the classroom. After each lesson, students completed a questionnaire\non learning activities in the lesson, including self-reported involvement [216], cognitive\nengagement [217], and situational interest [218]. The employed scales have been shown to\nbe related to engagement observer ratings and learning outcomes [79]. This resulted in\nvideo and questionnaire data for 323 student-lesson instances. Due to missing questionnaire\ninformation (i.e., item non-response), 18 instances had to be excluded for correlation\nanalysis with learning-related activities.\nManual Annotation\nTwo human raters manually annotated hand-raisings in all 36 videos.\nThe intra-class correlation coefficient of the two raters for the number of hand-raisings\nper student and lesson was 0.96, indicating very high inter-rater reliability. The number\nof hand-raisings averaged across the two observers was employed to analyze associations\nbetween student hand-raising and self-reported learning activities.

In Figure 5.5, we present four maps with 4, 10, 20, and 100\ncandidates, created using the FR embedding. As we can see, the maps for 10, 20,\nand 100 candidates are surprisingly similar. The largest difference we can observe\nis for the balanced group-separable elections\u2014for the case of 100 candidates they\nare clearly separated, while for 10 and 20 candidates they are mingling with the\nCircle elections. In addition, multidimensional Euclidean elections are better sep-\narated for 100 candidates than for 10 or 20 candidates. Another interesting thing\nis that the Walsh elections are shifting toward the right side of the embedding as\nwe increase the number of candidates. At the same time, the caterpillar group-\nseparable elections are shifting toward AN.\nOnly the map with four candidates is different. Yet, the main shape is still\nmaintained. Note that for 4 candidates, there are only 24 possible different votes,\nwhich likely explains why the map is not as meaningful.

Both the swap and Spearman distances are very precise, but slow to\ncompute.

These results help to\nunderstand the differences between our statistical cultures.\nThe maximum approval score statistic provides insight into whether there is\na candidate that is universally supported. Instances with a value close to 1 pos-\nsess such a candidate. In a single-winner election, this candidate is likely to be a\nclear winner. This is undesirable when simulating, for example, contested elec-\ntions. Also note that in the real-world data set (Pabulib) we do not observe such\ncandidates.\nWhen looking at the PAV runtime, we find some statistical cultures that gener-\nate computationally difficult elections, such as, e.g., the (p, \u03d5)-resampling model\nwith parameter values close to p = 0.5 and \u03d5 = 1 (0.5-IC), the noise model with\nparameters p \u2208[0.5, 0.9] and \u03d5 > 0.5, and the disjoint model with g = 2. Yet,\ninstances from the real-world dataset, as well as from the Euclidean and urn ones,\ncan be computed very quickly.3\nConcerning voters in cohesive groups, whenever this statistic is close to 1, it is\neasy to satisfy most voters with at least one approved candidate in the committee;\nsuch committees are easy to find [Aziz et al., 2017]. Since many proportional\nrules take special care of voters who belong to cohesive groups, in such elections\nthere are no voters that are at a systematic disadvantage. In many of our generated\nelections (almost) all voters belong to 1-cohesive groups, but this is not the case\nfor the real-world, Pabulib data. Indeed, to simulate Pabulib data well, we would\nlikely need to provide some new statistical culture(s).\nFor the cohesiveness level, we see that all models generate a full spectrum\n(i.e., [0, 10]) of cohesiveness levels. However, we expect realistic elections to\nappear in the \u201clower left\u201d part of our grid (with few approvals), and such elections\ntend to have low cohesiveness levels.

As expected, for ID we have\na single point in the center because all votes are identical, and for AN we have\ntwo points located at the largest possible distance because we have only two types\nof votes (i.e., 500 times vote v, and 500 times its reversed copy). For ST, we\nobserve a similar picture to the one for the IC election, however, the diameter is\nmuch smaller. This is because in an ST election all the voters agree that half of\nthe candidates are better than the other half, hence, the largest possible distance\nbetween two votes is equal to half of the largest possible distance between two\nvotes from IC.\nNext, we have three elections from the urn model. The larger is the \u03b1 param-\neter, the smaller is the number of different votes, leading to fewer points on the\nmap. To be more precise, below we provide the formula for the (upper bound\non the) expected number of different votes under the urn model, with assumption\nthat n \u2264m!.\nProposition 3.1.

The probability of having a new vote in the first iteration is 1; in the second\niteration it is at most\n1\n1+\u03b1; in the third iteration it is at most\n1\n1+2\u03b1 and so on.

Therefore, the expected number of different votes in n iterations is upper-\nbounded by Pn\ni=1\n1\n1+(i\u22121)\u03b1.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nSignificance\nRecently, the Almost Stochastic Order test (ASO; Dror et al.,\n2019)4 has been proposed to test statistical significance for DNNs over\nmultiple runs. Generally, the ASO test determines whether a stochastic\norder (Reimers and Gurevych, 2018) exists between two models or algo-\nrithms based on their respective sets of evaluation scores. Given the single\nmodel scores over multiple random seeds of two algorithms A and B, the\nmethod computes a test-specific value (\u03f5min) that indicates how far algo-\nrithm A is from being significantly better than algorithm B. When distance\n\u03f5min = 0.0, one can claim that A stochastically dominant over B with a\npredefined significance level. When \u03f5min < 0.5 one can say A \u2ab0B. On\nthe contrary, when we have \u03f5min = 1.0, this means B \u2ab0A. For \u03f5min = 0.5,\nno order can be determined.

The lack of comprehensive, open-source JAD data\nin various languages makes it difficult to fully pre-train a language model\n(LM) using such data. In this work, we seek external resources that can\nhelp improve the multilingual performance on the JAD domain. We use\nthe ESCO taxonomy (le Vrang et al., 2014), which is a standardized sys-\ntem for describing and categorizing the skills, competences, qualifications,\nand occupations of workers in the European Union. The ESCO taxonomy,\nwhich has been curated by humans, covers over 13,000 skills and 3,000\noccupations in 27 languages. Therefore, we seek to answer: To what ex-\ntent can we leverage the ESCO taxonomy to pre-train a domain-specific and\nlanguage-agnostic model for the computational job market domain?\nIn this work, we release the first multilingual JAD-related model named\nESCOXLM-R, a language model based on XLM-Rlarge that incorporates data\nfrom the ESCO taxonomy through the use of two pre-training objectives\n(Figure 8.1): Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and a novel ESCO rela-\ntion prediction task (Section 8.2). We evaluate ESCOXLM-R on 9 JAD-related\ndatasets in 4 different languages covering 2 NLP tasks (Section 8.3). Our\nresults show that ESCOXLM-R outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)\non 6 out of 9 datasets (Section 8.4). In addition, our fine-grained anal-\nysis reveals that ESCOXLM-R performs better on short spans compared\nto XLM-Rlarge, and consistently outperforms XLM-Rlarge on entity-level and\nsurface-level span-F1 (Section 8.5).\nContributions.\nIn this work, we present and release the following:\n\u2022 ESCOXLM-R, an XLM-Rlarge-based model, which utilizes domain-\n161\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat potential limitation of previous multilingual approaches to job advertisement data (JAD) tasks does ESCOXLM-R aim to address, and how does it attempt to overcome this limitation?", "response": "", "images": []}

Goal-Oriented Script Construction\nWe propose the task of Goal-Oriented Script Construction (GOSC) to holistically evaluate a model\u2019s\nunderstanding of scripts.Given a goal (or the name of a script), we ask the model to construct the\nsequence of steps (or events in a script) to achieve the goal. This task targets a model\u2019s ability to\nnarrate an entire script, subsuming most existing evaluation tasks. Our rationale is that a model\nthat understands some scripts (e.g. how to \u201ctravel abroad\u201d and \u201cgo to college\u201d) should be able to\nproduce new ones (e.g. how to \u201cstudy abroad\u201d) using the absorbed knowledge, close to how humans\nlearn.\nConcretely, given a goal g, a system constructs a complete script as an ordered list of steps S, with\na ground-truth reference T. As a hint of the desired level of granularity, we also provide an expected\nnumber of steps (or length of the script), l, as input. Depending on whether the set of possible\ncandidate steps are given in advance, GOSC can happen in two settings: Generation or Retrieval.\nWhile almost all prior script learning work has focused on English, we leverage our wikiHow corpus\nto enable multilingual settings, just as Section 3.2.1.\n47\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What key difference exists between the Step Inference and Step Ordering components in the pipeline, and how does this impact the overall script construction process?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/9235a189f83ab16c8bea620ad70571db.png"]}

As\na result, fusion happens at the abstract representation level. On the other hand, fusion with raw\nmodalities entails representation fusion at very early stages with minimal preprocessing, perhaps\neven involving raw modalities themselves.\nFusion with abstract modalities: We begin our treatment of representation fusion of abstract\nrepresentations with additive and multiplicative interactions. These operators can be seen as\ndifferentiable building blocks combining information from two streams of data that can be flexibly\ninserted into almost any unimodal machine learning pipeline. Given unimodal data or features x1\nand x2, additive fusion can be seen as learning a new joint representation zmm = w0+w1x1+w2x2+\u03f5,\nwhere w1 and w2 are the weights learned for additive fusion of x1 and x2, w0 the bias term, and\n\u03f5 the error term. If the joint representation zmm is directly taken as a prediction \u02c6\ny, then additive\nfusion resembles late or ensemble fusion \u02c6\ny = f1(x1) + f2(x2) with unimodal predictors f1 and\nf2 [180]. Otherwise, the additive representation zmm can also undergo subsequent unimodal or\nmultimodal processing [46]. Multiplicative interactions extend additive interactions to include\na cross term w3(x1 \u00d7 x2). These models have been used extensively in statistics, where it can\nbe interpreted as a moderation effect of x1 affecting the linear relationship between x2 and\ny [48]. Overall, purely additive interactions zmm = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 can be seen as a first-\norder polynomial between input modalities x1 and x2, combining additive and multiplicative\nzmm = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3(x1 \u00d7 x2) captures a second-order polynomial.\nTo further go beyond first and second-order interactions, tensors are specifically designed to\nexplicitly capture higher-order interactions across modalities [713].

We cover related work in (1) continuous warping of representation\nspaces and (2) modality segmentation of continuous signals into discrete elements at an appropriate\ngranularity.\n2.4.2\nSubchallenge 2b: Continuous alignment\nSo far, one important assumption we have made is that modality elements are already segmented\nand discretized. While certain modalities display clear segmentation (e.g., words/phrases in a\nsentence or object regions in an image), there are many cases where the segmentation is not readily\nprovided, such as in continuous signals (e.g, financial or medical time-series), spatiotemporal data\n(e.g., satellite or weather images), or data without clear semantic boundaries (e.g., MRI images).\nIn these settings, methods based on warping and segmentation have been recently proposed:\nContinuous warping aims to align two sets of modality elements by representing them as\ncontinuous representation spaces and forming a bridge between these representation spaces, such\nas aligning continuous audio and video data [187, 603, 604]. Adversarial training is a popular\napproach to warp one representation space into another. Initially used in domain adaptation [54],\nadversarial training learns a domain-invariant representation across domains where a domain\nclassifier is unable to identify which domain a feature came from [14]. These ideas have been\nextended to align multimodal spaces [247, 252, 431]. Hsu et al. [247] use adversarial training to\nalign images and medical reports, Hu et al. [252] design an adversarial network for cross-modal\nretrieval, and Munro and Damen [431] design both self-supervised alignment and adversarial\nalignment objectives for multimodal action recognition. Dynamic time warping (DTW) [321]\nsegments and aligns multi-view time-series data by maximizing their similarity via time warping\n(inserting frames) such that they are aligned across time. For multimodal tasks, it is necessary to\ndesign similarity metrics between modalities [28, 594], such as combining DTW with CCA or\nother coordination functions [612].\nModality segmentation involves dividing high-dimensional data into elements with seman-\ntically meaningful boundaries. A common problem involves temporal segmentation, where the\ngoal is to discover the temporal boundaries across sequential data. Several approaches for tem-\nporal segmentation include forced alignment, a popular approach to align discrete speech units\nwith individual words in a transcript [709]. Malmaud et al. [404] explore multimodal alignment\nusing a factored hidden Markov model to align ASR transcripts to the ground truth. Clustering\napproaches have also been used to group continuous data based on semantic similarity [402].\nClustering-based discretization has recently emerged as an important preprocessing step for\ngeneralizing language-based pretraining (with clear word/byte pair segmentation boundaries and\ndiscrete elements) to video or audio-based pretraining (without clear segmentation boundaries and\ncontinuous elements). By clustering raw video or audio features into a discrete set, approaches\nsuch as VideoBERT [577] perform masked pretraining on raw video and audio data.

We find high correlation (\u03c1 = 0.8) between the\nperformance drop when Xi is missing and the model\u2019s Ui\nvalue. Inspecting Figure 3.4, we find that the implication only\nholds in one direction: high Ui coincides with large perfor-\nmance drops (in red), but low Ui can also lead to performance\ndrops (in green). The latter can be further explained by the presence of large S values: when\nXi is missing, synergy can no longer be learned which affects performance. For the subset of\npoints when Ui \u22640.05, the correlation between S and performance drop is \u03c1 = 0.73 (in contrast,\nthe correlation for R is \u03c1 = 0.01).\n3.3.4\nPID agreement and model selection\nFigure 3.5: PID agreement \u03b1(f,D)\nbetween datasets and models strongly\ncorrelate with model accuracy (\u03c1 =\n0.81).\nNow that we have quantified datasets and models individu-\nally, the natural next question unifies both: what does the\nagreement between dataset and model PID measures tell us\nabout model performance? We hypothesize that models able\nto capture the interactions necessary in a given dataset should\nalso achieve high performance. Given estimated interactions\non dataset D and model f(D) trained on D, we define the\nagreement for each interaction I \u2208{R,U1,U2,S} as:\n\u03b1I(f,D) = \u02c6\nIDIf(D),\n\u02c6\nID =\nID\n\u2211I\u2032\u2208{R,U1,U2,S} I\u2032\nD\n,\n(3.6)\nwhich summarizes the quantity of an interaction captured by\na model (If(D)) weighted by its normalized importance in\nthe dataset (\u02c6\nID). The total agreement sums over \u03b1(f,D) =\n\u2211I \u03b1I(f,D).\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the presence of large synergy values (S) influence the performance of multimodal models when a modality Xi is missing, and how does this relationship compare to the influence of redundancy (R) values on performance drops?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/4fb2d01b74cebea5b556a8d51463e430.png", "data/qwen_images/2c3ab5215364d46b51734f8e4440bbd7.png", "data/qwen_images/75aae578e354467eb114752e970bf262.png"]}

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nof our pick-and-place mechanism with a laser cutter. In addition to placing electrical com-\nponents on a device, we can also pick-and-place pieces of the material substrate. To harvest\nthese pieces, shapes are first cut from the substrate and then the pick-and-place is used to\nstack them to create 3D structures (Figure 3.4b). By discretizing a structure into layers,\nthese layers can be cut using a focused laser, stacked via pick-and-place, and welded using a\ndefocused laser [113] to produce rigid 3D structures without manual intervention.\nFigure 3.4: LaserFactory can be used to create (a) 2.5D geometries via folding, (b) as well\nas discretized 3D geometries via cutting and pick-and-placing the material substrate itself.\n3.3\nAugmenting a Laser Cutter Through Motion-Based\nSignaling\nAugmenting existing fabrication devices reduces engineering effort by piggy-backing exist-\ning platforms rather than building hardware/software from scratch, and by making the new\nfunctionality available to a wide range of users who already own or operate the platform.\nHowever, interfacing with a commercial fabrication platform that is not built to accommodate\nan expansion of its functionality is challenging [15]. In building our hardware augmentation\nto a laser head, we investigated solutions that do not require access to the proprietary soft-\nware of the fabrication platform and that therefore could potentially be platform-agnostic to\npermit augmenting a range of different fabrication devices. To this end, our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, our method embeds additional lines in the fabrication file. These\ninclude additional paths such as trajectories for navigating between electrical components,\nand also specific motion patterns that signal instructions to the add-on. Second, our method\ndetects these motion patterns using a motion-based classifer based on accelerometer data\nrunning locally on the add-on. Our method to transmit fabrication instructions thereby re-\nlies only on the fabrication platform\u2019s ability to execute motion in the X-Y plane; the add-on\nhas no explicit knowledge of the contents of the fabrication file itself.

{"query": "Context:\n\nfor components with standard pin spacings of 2.54mm.\nPick and place component criteria: We evaluated the criteria under which LaserFactory\ncan pick and place components. First, components require a minimum flat surface area of\n3x3mm above the component\u2019s center of mass for the suction tip\u2019s 2.5mm diameter nozzle\nto form a good contact. We found this could be increased or decreased by increasing or\ndecreasing the diameter of the pick-and-place nozzle, respectively. Second, components must\nhave a mass smaller than 65g for the pump suction to lift them. This threshold allows lifting\nlarge components, such as an Arduino Mega micro-controller (37g). A stronger pump could\nfurther raise this threshold. Third, their height cannot exceed 27 mm, currently limited by\nthe maximum extension of the linear potentiometer used to assess picking height. Given these\nconstraints, LaserFactory can pick large, heavy components, such as typical 3V batteries;\ntall components such as rotors; and a variety of small components, such as SMD resistors\ndown to size 2010. For future work, these constraints can be further lifted by using a smaller\nnozzle, larger pump, and longer lead screw.\nUse over time: During the course of fabrication, the peak power draw measured from\nthe two on-board parallel 9V lithium ion batteries was 13.5W. Between no-load cases of\ncutting/folding and variable-load cases of PCB-making, this is sufficient for approximately\n4 hours of continuous device creation. We detected no irregularities in laser carriage motion\nthat would indicate undue stress on the laser cutter during use.\n3.2\nLaser sintering: Curing Circuit Traces using a CO2\nlaser\nWhen both the silver paste has been deposited and the components have been placed onto\na substrate in the laser cutter, the silver is not yet conductive, nor does it rigidly bond\ncomponents to the substrate. For this, the silver requires curing via heating, traditionally\nachieved via baking the created device in an oven before it becomes functional. However, this\nhas several drawbacks, such as that the heat in the oven can damage the material substrate\nand the electronic components due to the thermal stresses. To solve this issue, we developed\na technique that uses the laser to cure the circuit traces and connect components electrically.\nA benefit of using the laser is that it allows for a fully integrated fabrication process with no\nmanual work required. In addition, heat is only applied locally to traces and thus affects the\nmaterial sheet only in the locations of the trace. Finally, using the laser is fast, approximately\n5 minutes in contrast to the 2 hours achieved via uniform heating in an oven [15]. Once the\nlast circuit trace is cured, the device is functional right off the fabrication bed.\n3.2.1\nFabrication Settings for Laser Sintering\nWe ran a set of experiments to determine the best power, speed, and z-axis settings for\ncuring silver traces. For the experiments, we used a Universal Laser Systems ULS.PLS.150D\nlaser cutter equipped with a 2.0 inch lens. For the silver, we used the silver paste from\nSunChemical (C2180423D2), which has a composition of 56.69% 24K silver and 43.31% a\nblend of resin and solvents.\n43\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential improvements that could be made to the LaserFactory's pick-and-place system to enhance its capability to handle a wider range of components, and how might these improvements address the current limitations?", "response": "", "images": []}

We also created their complement matrices: the corresponding\nmagnetic pixel pattern produced by multiplying each matrix by -1. We then translated each\nmatrix pixel-by-pixel, in both X and Y directions, across its complement and evaluated the\nresulting force at each increment.\nSimulation Results: Figure 6.10(b) shows the predicted interaction between each matrix.\nWe generated the predicted values by computing the normalized cross-correlation between\neach matrix and its complement. This effectively implies taking the sum of all attractive\n(-1) and repulsive (+1) pixel interactions, and dividing by the number of pixels. As a result,\ncross-correlation values of -1 designate perfect attraction, +1 is perfect repulsion and 0 is\nagnosticism. When the checkerboard matrix and Hadamard matrix are centered on their\nrespective complements, they are by definition attractive at every pixel, yielding a value of\n-1. Elsewhere, the checkerboard produces oscillating attractive and repulsive interactions\nwith every pixel-wise translation, whereas the Hadamard remains perfectly agnostic in pure\nX-translation and Y-translation, and maximally agnostic for mixed translation.\nFigure 6.11: Translational agnosticism of a matrix A with its mate A\u2019.

Given an input (x(1), . . . , x(N)) \u2208RD1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 RDN (illustration assumes D1 =\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = DN = D to avoid clutter), the network processes it using a single hidden layer, which consists of:\n(i) locally connected linear operator with R channels, computing (W(1))\u22a4x(1), . . . , (W(N))\u22a4x(N) with\nlearnable weights W(1), . . . , W(N) (this operator is referred to as \u201c1 \u00d7 1 conv\u201d in appeal to the common\ncase of weight sharing, i.e. W(1) = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = W(N)); and (ii) channel-wise global product pooling (which\ninduces polynomial non-linearity). Summing over the resulting activations then yields the scalar output\n\n\u2297N\nn=1x(n), \u2211R\nr=1 \u2297N\nn=1W(n)\n:,r\n\u000b =\n\n\u2297N\nn=1x(n), WT\n\u000b\n. Hence, functions realized by this class of networks\nare naturally represented via tensor factorization, where the number of components R and the weight\nmatrices W(1), . . . , W(N) of the factorization correspond to the width and learnable weights of the\nnetwork, respectively. Bottom: for a hierarchical tensor factorization induced by a perfect P-ary mode\ntree (Definition 4), the equivalent network is a deep variant of that associated with tensor factorization.\nIt has L = logP N hidden layers instead of just one, with channel-wise product pooling operating over\nwindows of size P as opposed to globally. After passing an input (x(1), . . . , x(N)) \u2208RD1 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 RDN\nthrough all hidden layers, a final linear layer produces the network\u2019s scalar output\n\n\u2297N\nn=1x(n), WH\n\u000b\n,\nwhere WH is the end tensor of the hierarchical tensor factorization (Equation (3.3)), whose weight\nmatrices are equal to the network\u2019s learnable weights. Thus, functions realized by this class of networks\nare naturally represented via hierarchical tensor factorization. We note that, as shown in [48], by\nconsidering generalized hierarchical tensor factorizations it is possible to account for various non-linearities\nbeyond polynomial, i.e. for product pooling being converted to a different pooling operator (e.g. max or\naverage), optionally preceded by a non-linear activation (e.g. rectified linear unit).\nto move slower when small and faster when large. This suggests that, in analogy\nwith matrix factorization, components tend to be learned incrementally, yielding a\nbias towards low tensor rank. For completeness, Figure 3.1 (middle) demonstrates\nthe phenomenon empirically, reproducing the experiment from Section 2.5.1. Recall\nthat, similarly to the case of matrix factorization, under certain technical conditions\nwe used in Section 2.4 the incremental tensor rank learning phenomenon to prove\nexact tensor rank minimization.\n3.3\nHierarchical Tensor Factorization\nIn this section we present the hierarchical tensor factorization model. We begin by\ninformally introducing the core concepts (Section 3.3.1), after which we delve into the\nformal definitions (Section 3.3.2).\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Explain how the process of tensor factorization, as illustrated in the provided figure, can be interpreted as a shallow non-linear convolutional network.

{"query": "Context:\n\n14 \n \n2.2.1. The Concept of Drought \nDrought is a naturally occurring climate phenomenon that impacts human and \nenvironmental activity globally and is considered to be one of the costliest and \nmost widespread of natural disasters (Smith & Katz, 2013; Below, Grover-Kopec \n& Dilley, 2007). In terms of negative impacts, droughts are currently ranked \nnumber one (Wilhite & Glantz, 1985, Guha-Sapir et al., 2012). Compared to other \nnatural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and epidemics, droughts \nare very difficult to predict; they creep slowly and last longest. According to \nEspinoza et al. (2011), drought qualifies as a hazard because it is a natural \nincidence of erratic occurrence but of recognisable recurrence and as a disaster.  \nDrought is a result of precipitation deficiency, which causes disruption of the \nwater supply to the natural and agricultural ecosystems (Mohamed, 2011). \nHowever, drought is a natural environmental phenomenon, and its recurrence in \nsusceptible areas is almost inevitable (Mishra & Desai, 2006; Gana, 2003). \nHowever, lack of definite characteristics of drought is a major dilemma for the \nscientific and policy-making community and is preventing a detailed \nunderstanding of the drought phenomenon. The absence of an accurate and precise \ndefinition of drought has been an obstacle to understanding drought, which has \nled to indecision and inaction on the part of the individuals concerned managers, \npolicy-makers (Wilhite & Glantz, 1985; Wilhite et al., 1986). \nDrought can be termed as a normal, recurrent feature of climate, which is \nsometimes rare and occurs randomly. The occurrence of drought in a particular \ngeographic area varies from region to regions. Drought is a creeping disaster; it \noccurs when there is less than normal precipitation over an extended period of \ntime, usually a season or more (Dea & Scoones, 2003). The lack of or reduced water \ninput causes water shortages to various activities that require water in the \necosystem such as agricultural irrigation, animal use, and other (Edossa, Woyessa \n& Welderufael, 2014). Drought can also occur when the temperature is higher than \nnormal for a sustained period; this results in higher evapotranspiration (i.e., \nevaporation and transpiration) than the precipitation. The increase in the \nevaporation cycle makes water vapour in the air for precipitation but contributes \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the primary challenges in defining and predicting drought, and how do these challenges impact the decision-making process for policymakers and scientists?", "response": "", "images": []}

Although DiaPer is slower for very short recordings, it can run faster\nthan the standard EEND-EDA when processing several-minute recordings. This speed-up\nis mainly given by the more light-weight nature of DiaPer which results in a faster frame\nencoder processing, which dominates the computation time versus the attractor decod-\ning in both models. To have a fair comparison, \u201cEEND-EDA small\u201d denotes a version of\nEEND-EDA where the model dimension matches that of DiaPer in its best configuration\n(128-dimensional frame embeddings and attractors). This corresponds to using the same\nframe encoder in both models and we can see that DiaPer is slightly slower due to more\ncomputations in the attractor decoder. It should be noted that EEND-EDA small performs\nslightly worse than EEND-EDA in terms of DER.

A monad over a category C is an endofunctor T : C \u2192C equipped\nwith two natural transformations \u03b7: id \u21d2T and \u00b5: T 2 \u21d2T such that the following diagrams\nT 3X\nT 2X\nT 2X\nT X\nT \u00b5X\n\u00b5T X\n\u00b5X\n\u00b5X\nT X\nT 2X\nT 2X\nT X\n\u03b7T X\nT \u03b7X\n\u00b5X\n\u00b5X\ncommute. We call \u03b7 the unit of T and we say that \u00b5 is the multiplication of T .\nNext, we recall the definition of a strong monad, which is the main object of study in\nChapter 2. As we already explained in the introduction, these monads are more computationally\nrelevant (compared to non-strong ones) for most use cases. The additional structure, called\nthe monadic strength, ensures the monad interacts appropriately with the monoidal structure\nof the base category.\nDefinition 1.96 (Strong Monad). A strong monad over a monoidal category (C, \u2297, I, \u03b1, \u03bb, \u03c1)\nis a monad (T , \u03b7, \u00b5) equipped with a natural transformation \u03c4X,Y : X \u2297T Y \u2192T (X \u2297Y ),\ncalled left strength, such that the following diagrams commute:\nI \u2297T X\nT (I \u2297X)\nT X\n\u03bbT X\n\u03c4I,X\nT \u03bbX\n(W \u2297X) \u2297T Y\nW \u2297(X \u2297T Y )\nW \u2297T (X \u2297Y )\nT (W \u2297(X \u2297Y ))\nT ((W \u2297X) \u2297Y )\n\u03c4W\u2297X,Y\nT \u03b1W,X,Y\nW \u2297\u03c4X,Y\n\u03c4W,X\u2297Y\n\u03b1W,X,T Y\nX \u2297Y\nX \u2297T Y\nT (X \u2297Y )\n\u03b7X\u2297Y\nX \u2297\u03b7Y\n\u03c4X,Y\nX \u2297T 2Y\nT (X \u2297T Y )\nT 2(X \u2297Y )\nX \u2297T Y\nT (X \u2297Y )\nX \u2297\u00b5Y\n\u03c4X,T Y\nT \u03c4X,Y\n\u00b5X\u2297Y\n\u03c4X,Y\nWe now recall the definition of a commutative monad which is of central importance here\nand in Chapter 2. Compared to a strong monad, a commutative monad enjoys even stronger\ncoherence properties with respect to the monoidal structure of the base category (see also\n\u00a71.5.3).\nDefinition 1.97 (Commutative Monad). Let (T , \u03b7, \u00b5, \u03c4) be a strong monad on a symmetric\nmonoidal category (C, \u2297, I, \u03b3).

{"query": "Context:\n\nWe have brought forward a categorical interpretation to the programming language intro-\nduced in \u00a74.2. This interpretation makes use of the join inverse rig structure to define the\niso abstraction and to perform a pattern-matching that ensures reversibility; an enrichment in\nDCPO allows to consider recursive isos and inductive data types are represented with the help\nor parameterised initial algebras.\nIndependently of how convincing this model is, it is good practice to prove it has a strong\nlink with the operational semantics of the language. This link is called adequacy, and is the\nfocus of the next section.\n4.4\nAdequacy\nWe show a strong relation between the operational semantics and the denotational se-\nmantics which were introduced in the previous sections. First, we fix a mathematical interpret-\nation J\u2212K in a join inverse rig category C, that is DCPO-enriched and whose objects 0 and 1\nare distinct.\nSince the language handles non-termination, our adequacy statement links the denotational\nsemantics to the notion of termination in the operational semantics.\nDefinition 4.28 (Terminating). Given \u22a2t: A, t is said terminating if there exists a value v\nsuch that t \u2192\u2217v. We either write t \u2193, or t \u2193v.\nSince the system is deterministic, if t \u2193v, then v is unique.\nThe goal of this section is to prove the next theorem.\nTheorem 4.29 (Adequacy). Given \u22a2t: A, t \u2193iff J\u22a2t: AK \u0338= 01,JAK.\nInterestingly enough, there are two ways for a term\n\u22a2t: A to have 01,JAK as its inter-\npretation: either it reduces over and over in an infinite loop (see Example 4.13), or it is stuck\nbecause of pattern-matching (see Example 4.14).\nOne strategy could be the use of formal approximation relations, introduced by Plotkin\n[Plo85]. However, because of our two seperate levels of abstraction (a fixed point calculus at\nthe level of isos, and inductive types at the level of terms), the definition of the relations and\nproving that they exist would be long and of little interest to the reader. We rather choose a\nsyntactic approach, inspired by the proof in [PSV14].\n4.4.1\nSoundness\nWe start by showing the simple implication in Theorem 4.29, that the denotational semantics\nis stable w.r.t. computation; in other words, applying a rule of the operational semantics does\nnot change the mathematical interpretation. The other direction \u2013 which is made formal later\n\u2013 is called adequacy, and is usually harder to prove. See \u00a74.4.2 for full details on the adequacy\nresult.\n142\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What is the significance of the join inverse rig structure in the categorical interpretation of the programming language introduced in \u00a74.2, and how does it relate to the concept of adequacy between operational and denotational semantics?", "response": "", "images": []}

Data fusion is\na ubiquitous problem in environmental and climate science, as observations of a variable\nare often available from multiple stations, satellite platforms, and model outputs. The data\nfusion task is toy experiment to showcase the potential of the ConvCNP for these types of\nproblems. For the data fusion task, we randomly divide the weather station observations into\na context set and a target set. The model must learn to fuse the observed weather stations\nwith the ERA-Interim reanalysis variables and elevation data to produce the best predictions\npossible for the unobserved weather stations. The MLP ConvCNP and MLP ConvGNP\nhave no mechanism to incorporate the observed weather stations; hence, these models\nsimply ignore this data. Table 6.18 shows the results. For the downscaling task the AR\nConvCNP achieves the same log-likelihood and MAE as the MLP ConvGNP, demonstrating\nthat autoregressive CNPs can be successfully applied to perform statistical downscaling.\nFor the data fusion task, the AR ConvCNP achieves better log-likelihood and MAE than\nthe MLP ConvCNP and MLP ConvGNP. On the one hand, this is according to expectations,\nbecause only the AR ConvCNP makes use of the observed weather stations. On the other\nhand, the AR ConvCNP is a vastly more involved model than the MLP ConvCNP and MLP\nConvGNP, so it is encouraging to see that the model is functioning correctly and beats the\nstrong performance of the MLP ConvGNP in this task.\n6.6\nConclusion\nIn this chapter, we conducted four experiments that evaluate and test the limits of existing\nand newly proposed neural process models.\nFirst, in Section 6.2, we performed a large-scale bake-off between five existing and eight\nnewly proposed models (Table 6.1), evaluating every model in a total of 60 different subex-\nperiments.

Intuitively, this\nchoice for c measures the distance to the diagonal and decays based on that distance.\nProof. To prove Theorem 4.9, our approach will be to first rewrite (4.18) to have T(\u03c4,\u03c4) on\nboth sides. Once (4.18) is in this form, we will apply Theorem 4.8 with X \u00d7 X as the space\nof inputs. Recall that Theorem 4.8 generalises to higher-dimensional inputs.\nTo rewrite (4.17), we use a simple trick: duplicating the inputs. Let Ddbl be the collection of\ndata sets with inputs in Xdbl := X \u00d7 X and outputs in Y. The \u201cdbl\u201d in the subscript of Ddbl\nstands for \u201cdouble\u201d and serves to remind the reader that there are double the number of\ninputs.

Let dup\u22121 : Ddup \u2192D\nbe right inverse of dup: dup\u22121 takes in a data set with duplicated inputs and recovers the\noriginal by deduplicating the inputs.\nWith these definitions, we can relate T\u03c4 : D \u2192D to T(\u03c4,\u03c4) : Ddbl \u2192Ddbl:\nT\u03c4 = dup\u22121 \u25e6T(\u03c4,\u03c4) \u25e6dup.\n(4.21)\nDefine \u03c0dup := \u03c0 \u25e6dup\u22121, and note that \u03c0dup : Ddup \u2192Z operates on data sets with\nduplicated inputs.

{"query": "Context:\n\nExample in ITSC. The HMM model considers two hidden states: \u201chigh traffic\u201d and\n\u201clow traffic\u201d. The observed states are the traffic flow rates measured by sensors at the\nintersection. When the traffic flow rates are high, indicating congestion, the HMM will\ntransition to the \u201chigh traffic\u201d state. On the other hand, when the traffic flow rates are\nlow, indicating smooth traffic flow, the HMM will transition to the \u201clow traffic\u201d state.\nLimitations: HMMs assume that the underlying system follows the Markov property,\nmeaning that the probability of transitioning to a new state depends only on the cur-\nrent state and not on the past states. This assumption may not always hold in real-\nworld scenarios, particularly in dynamic environments where the system\u2019s behavior\nmay be influenced by a long history of states and observations [223, 207]. In other\nwords, HMMs assume that observations directly depend only on the current hidden\nstate and do not account for more complex dependencies or context [218]. This can be a\nlimitation in scenarios where richer contextual information or non-linear relationships\nexist. Also, HMMs heavily rely on sufficient training data to estimate model paramet-\ners accurately [182, 13]. In situations where data is scarce, or noisy, the performance of\nHMMs may be compromised. Additionally, HMMs may struggle when faced with rare\nevents that are not well-represented in the training data [136]. As an example of limita-\ntions in the ITSC domain, during peak hours, traffic congestion can build up gradually,\nand the behavior of the system may depend on the traffic conditions experienced over\nan extended period. Additionally, contextual factors like weather conditions, special\nevents, or road infrastructure changes may affect traffic behavior. Moreover, when an\nITSC system is deployed in a newly developed neighborhood with limited historical\ntraffic data, there may be a scarcity of representative training data for the HMM to ac-\ncurately estimate the underlying traffic patterns and model parameters. Furthermore,\nwhen a rare event such as a major sporting event or a large-scale construction project\nsignificantly impacts traffic patterns in the area, and it is not adequately represented in\nthe training data, the HMM may struggle to handle this rare event effectively.\n2.1.3\nMonte Carlo Methods\nMonte Carlo methods [34], such as particle filters or sequential Monte Carlo meth-\nods, can estimate the hidden state of a system in a partially observable environment.\nBy propagating a set of particles through the system\u2019s state space and updating their\nweights based on observations, Monte Carlo methods provide a probabilistic estimate\nof the system\u2019s true state. This enables effective state estimation even in the absence of\ncomplete observability.

That said, there does appear to be a stronger\nrelationship between input margins and generalization, for Tasks 2 and 4.

This indicates that the\n\u2018high\u2019 correlation achieved by input margins for this task is perhaps spurious, and the relationship\nis possibly less causal in nature.\nIn terms of hidden margins, it is clear that the selection of hidden layers can have a large\neffect. One observes that performance can vary greatly for a single task depending on which\nhidden layers are considered. However, all four selection methods outperform input margins on\naverage.

Notice that this relationship need not necessarily be present\n\u2013 in both cases the margin is much smaller than the max margin (i.e. its upper bound) would\nsuggest.

{"query": "Context:\n\nChapter 1\nMargin-based complexity measures\nhave been proposed. These include theoretically proven bounds on the generalization error, such\nas Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension [6] and PAC-Bayesian bounds [7]. However, in the case\nof DNNs these bounds are generally not sufficiently tight to be practically useful [8]\u2013[10]. In\nfact, recent work [8] suggests that in the overparameterized setting, these bounds cannot be tight\nwithout making strong assumptions about the data distribution. A complementary approach\nto developing theoretical bounds is to develop empirical techniques that are able to predict\nthe generalization ability of certain families of DNN models. That is, techniques that are able\nto estimate or rank the generalization performance of a set of models using only the models\u2019\ntraining data and parameters.\nPredicting the generalization of a given model, or set of models, is important for several reasons:\n\u2022 An accurate measure of generalization could lead to a better theoretical understanding of\nthe mechanisms behind generalization in DNNs.\n\u2022 Such a measure could aid in model selection.\n\u2022 Should a measure be predictive of generalization, it could be possible to incorporate it\nin the training process, e.g. as a regularization term, which could further improve the\nperformance of DNNs.\n\u2022 In some settings, sufficient data is not available in order to estimate the generalization\nability of a model on a held-out dataset.

All parameters have\nbeen fixed after a grid search over the hyperparameter space. Note that the fine-tuning phase is\nlonger than the commonly used in the vision domain [35]. Black-box models are pre-trained using\nan early stopping with a patience of 20 epochs. We run the models from 15 different initializations\nand compute the average ROC-AUC and its standard deviation.\nTable 6.2 reports the ROC-AUC of the black-box models, the same models fine-tuned by using\nGCW, and three commonly used baselines in these datasets: random forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP), and message-passing neural networks (MPNN) [65]. The results demonstrate the perfor-\nmance benefits of fine-tuning models using GCW. Specifically, models fine-tuned with GCW\noutperform the black-box variants in all the configurations and the baselines in all but in the\nHIV dataset. In this dataset, MLP reaches the best performance against all the competitors. The\nimprovement of the GCW models can be attributed to the ability of the GCW layers to encour-\nage node embeddings to represent class-specific information, aiding discrimination among classes.\nThese results align with the ones reported by Chen et al.

We use GAT trained on BBBP as the example model. However, similar results can\nbe obtained for other models.\nWe begin the investigation by comparing the separability (Equation (2.27)) in the latent space\nexposed by the black-box models and the models incorporating GCW. Figure 6.1 shows that models\nwith GCW layers achieve superior separability. In particular, note that molecular properties\nthat are not similar, like NoCount and TPSA, exhibit better separation in in the interpretable\nmodel than in the black-box model (score 0.2 vs 0.37). Conversely, chemically related properties\n(e.g., TPSA and LogP) are similar in the representation (score 0.68). These results confirm a better\ndisentanglement induced by GCW useful for improving the interpretability of the axes.\nTable 6.2: Avg.

Hence, the previously reported\nresults correspond to those obtained by solely optimizing this metric. One limitation of IoU, as\nhighlighted in previous literature [145, 163], is that the IoU can be artificially increased by increasing\nthe formula\u2019s length. Common fixes for this issue include presetting the length for all neurons before\napplying the algorithm or introducing a term to penalize lengthy explanations [163].\nConcept masking involves multiple iterations of feeding the entire dataset to the architecture.\nConsequently, optimizing this metric during the beam process poses computational time challenges.\nIn the case of optimizing for activation coverage, given the fixed denominator, only the nu-\nmerator - the intersection between labels and activations - matters. In this case, the intersection\ndisproportionally favors larger concepts covering the entire activation, even if the covered portion\nis a tiny fraction of the label annotation. Consequently, at first sight, scene concepts covering the\nwhole image are expected to be associated with the neurons. However, scene concepts do not cover\nthe full dataset, resulting in several zeros in the equation. Therefore, the algorithm converges to-\nwards default rules composed of colors since they are the most frequent ones and the largest among\nthe most frequent.\nTable 7.7 shows the results using Detection Accuracy as an optimization metric. While im-\nprovements in terms of Sample Coverage and Detection accuracy are expected, it is interesting to\nnote that Concept Masking also benefits from this metric. Conversely, the IoU score and Activa-\ntion Coverage drop down to zero, indicating a potential correlation between these metrics and an\nopposite behavior to the Detection Accuracy.\nThese results underscore the absence of a straightforward method in the optimiza-\ntion process to artificially inflate the overall score using novel metrics and reinforce the\nnotion that multiple metrics should be used at the same time to have a fuller understanding of the\nquality of these approaches.\n7.4\nDesign Choices\nThis section delves into design choices connected to the implementation of our proposed algorithm.\nNumber of Clusters.\nOne critical design choice is the number of clusters per neuron.

We calculate a moving average estimate ZMA of Z which is then used inside the\nestimations of DKL(p, \u03c0\u03b8) and DKL(p, q) (see below Algorithm 3, lines 7 and 8). ZMA is updated\nat each training iteration. ZMA is an unbiased estimate of Z because each \u02c6\nZi is an unbiased\nestimate of Z based on K samples. Moreover, because the proposal distribution q evolves and\ngets closer to the target distribution p, the quality of the estimate of ZMA through importance\nsampling increases.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging test question based on the target tables:\n\nHow does the addition of a baseline term affect the gradient estimation in DPG versus DPGoff, and what is the key difference in how this baseline is calculated between the two methods?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/c990765b4cc7de800afbd37bf5c27926.png", "data/qwen_images/a1f1d1e71e6ca5db269fe9e51af4d56c.png"]}

In this two sections, we\nfocused on variance reduction using baselines, but the space of possible enhancements is vast.\nPromising candidates include further reducing the variance using a learned value function (Konda\n& Tsitsiklis, 2000) and preventing detrimentally large policy updates by maintaining a trust region\nin the policy space, akin to techniques such as TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015) and PPO (Schulman\net al., 2017).\nOne limitation of DPG is that, in contrast with KL-regularised RL, it only allows for ap-\nproximating target distributions defined for unconditional LMs. However, the most impactful\ndownstream applications of LMs involve conditional tasks (such as document summarisation or\ndialogue), in which we sample from an LM based on a specific context (e.g., source document or\ndialogue history). The next chapter will address this shortcoming and extend DPG to conditional\ntarget distribution.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat key limitation of DPG does the author indicate will be addressed in the next chapter, and why is overcoming this limitation important for practical applications of language models?", "response": "", "images": []}
{"query": "Context:\n\n7\n2.3 Approaches to aligning language models\n4. Perpetuating social bias. As Internet consists largely of crawled user-generated content (e.g.,\nGao et al., 2020), a number of factors (from crawling methodology to Internet participation\ninequalities and moderation practices) leads to an over-representation of certain viewpoints\nand voices exceeding their prevalence in the general population. This poses a risk of\namplifying biases and harms through a language model perpetuating these voices (Bender\net al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020; Sheng et al., 2019).\nHowever, it is important to note that misalignment, as defined here, is just one of many\nthreat models associated with future, and highly capable LMs. Others include malicious use (LMs\ncould be weaponized or used by malevolent for cyberwarfare, physical warfare, surveillance,\nor to manipulate public opinion; Weidinger et al., 2021a), lack of transparency (opaque auto-\nmated decision-making could disempower human stakeholders), social and economic disruption\n(significant job displacement and economic upheavals leading to social unrest and increased\ninequality; Eloundou et al., 2023); as well as goal misgeneralisation (pursing a different goal than\nthe one specified in the training objective; Hubinger et al., 2021; Langosco et al., 2022). These are\nimportant problems in AI safety research that remain out of the scope of this thesis.\n2.3\nApproaches to aligning language models\nFor the purposes of this thesis, aligning an LM means constraining its output to satisfy certain\nhuman preferences and making the preferred behavior more likely. Human preferences might refer\nto avoiding specific alignment failures mentioned in the previous section or to a general notion\nof being a helpful, honest and harmless AI assistant (Askell et al., 2021). Importantly, wherever\nwe speak of human preferences, we mean preferences of system designers. For the purpose of\nthis thesis, we treat human preferences as a given, side-stepping the issues of how we decide\nwhat are fair and worthwhile alignment targets.

We propose to study Causal\nComponent Analysis (CauCA) as an intermediate representation learning problem, in which\nthe causal graph is known, but non-trivial, see Fig. 5.6 for an illustration. CauCA can be viewed\nas a causal generalisation of ICA, or as a special case of CRL that focuses only on learning the\n(un)mixing function and causal mechanisms. Any negative results regarding identifiability of\nCauCA therefore also apply for CRL, while possibility results translate directly to ICA and\nmay serve as a stepping stone for extensions to CRL.\nWe study CauCA in a multi-environment setting in which the intervention targets {Ie}e\u2208E\nare known. However, we do not restrict ourselves to perfect interventions, but also consider\nimperfect and multi-node (\u201cfat-hand\u201d) interventions.

Similar to Thm. 5.10 in the full CRL\nsetting, one perfect intervention per node suffices for identifiability of CauCA, though without\nthe need for a genericity condition as the known graph and intervention targets provide addi-\ntional information.

The latter condition states that f is in the IMA\nfunction class. This connection shows that the ELBO of (near-deterministic) VAEs actually\ncorresponds to an IMA-regularised (rather than an exact) likelihood, and elucidates unintended\npotential benefits of using the ELBO for unsupervised representation learning.\nin conflicting claims that the gap either disappears (Nielsen et al., 2020) or implicitly encodes\ncertain inductive biases (Kumar and Poole, 2020; Rolinek et al., 2019).\nWe set out to rigorously study the effects of ELBO maximisation for unsupervised representa-\ntion learning for the standard class of VAEs with (i) isotropic Gaussian decoder, (ii) log-concave\n(e.g., Gaussian) prior, and (iii) diagonal Gaussian encoder, see Fig. 3.6 (top) for a visualisation.\nFirst, we show that in the near-deterministic regime as the decoder precision \u03b32 \u2192\u221e, the\noptimal encoder approximately inverts the decoder, in the sense that its mean and variances\nconverge to the inverse of the decoder mean and zero at rates O(1/\u03b3) and O(1/\u03b32), respectively.\nThis property is also referred to as self-consistency and had been conjectured but not formally\nshown in prior work.

For small decoder variances (as commonly used in practice), the\nlearning objective of VAEs thus approximately implements an implicit bias for decoders from\nthe IMA function class, which, as argued throughout this chapter, can benefit identifiability.\nEmpirically, we find that the ELBO\u2217also converges to Lima and not to the exact log-likelihood\nfor finite decoder precisions (when the true mixing is not in the IMA function class), see Fig. 3.7\n(left).

In this sense, our results lend some\ntheoretical support for the empirically observed success of such methods. Further, we introduce\nCausal3DIdent, a semi-synthetic image dataset with dependent latents, and use it to study the\neffect of data augmentations performed in practice. In follow-up works, we extend our analysis\nto different modalities, more than two views, and identifiability of individual style variables.\nIn Chapter 5, we study multi-environment CRL from multiple non-identically distributed\ndatasets, arising from unknown interventions in an underlying latent causal model. Specifically,\nwe consider a fully nonparametric setting in which both the mixing function and the latent\ncausal model are completely unconstrained, thus complementing existing studies relying on\nparametric assumptions such as linearity. Our goal is to identify both the ground truth latents\nand the unknown causal graph up to a set of ambiguities which we show to be irresolvable from\ninterventional data alone. For the fundamental setting of two causal variables, we prove that\nthe observational distribution and one perfect intervention per node suffice for identifiability,\nsubject to a genericity condition which rules out spurious solutions that involve fine-tuning of\nthe intervened and observational distributions, mirroring similar conditions for nonlinear cause-\neffect inference. For an arbitrary number of variables, we show that two distinct paired perfect\ninterventions per node guarantee identifiability. Further, we demonstrate that the strengths of\ncausal influences among the latent variables are preserved by all equivalent solutions, rendering\nthe inferred representation appropriate for drawing causal conclusions from new data. Finally,\nwe discuss other multi-environment works in which we focus on tasks such as causal component\nanalysis, structure learning, or domain generalization.\nChapter 6 discusses our findings in a broader context.

For these datasets, we create\ndataset samples [144] with user groups that differ in their inclination to popular\nand mainstream content, and analyze popularity bias of various CF-based rec-\nommendation algorithms on the levels of items and users. On the item level, we\nfind that the probability of an item to be recommended strongly correlates with\nthe popularity of the item. On the user level, we find that users with the least\ninclination to popular content also receive the worst recommendation quality.\n28\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Compare and contrast the popularity bias observed in the three recommendation algorithms depicted in Figure 3.4.

{"query": "Context:\n\n2.3\nPrivacy and Limited Preference Information in\nRecommender Systems\nThis section gives an overview of privacy-aware recommendations. Since the users\u2019\nprivacy concerns could also lead to the limited availability of preference informa-\ntion (e.g., users disclose their preferences, or do not sign in to the system), this\nsection also gives an overview of session-based and cold-start recommendations.\n2.3.1\nPrivacy-aware Recommendations\nIn terms of privacy, this habilitation focuses on differentially-private recommenda-\ntions. This section also briefly discusses privacy aspects of recommender systems.\nPrivacy Aspects of Recommender Systems\nRecommender systems need to store and process user preference information,\nwhich could lead to potential privacy risks to its users [91]. This includes the\ninference of private information. Here, related research has shown that inference\nattacks can be used to derive a user\u2019s sensitive information (e.g., gender [252])\nbased on the information shared with the recommender system [33,130,279]. For\nexample, in k-nearest neighbor-based recommender systems, the use of neighbors\u2019\npreference information in the recommendation process can pose a privacy risk to\nthe neighbors [225,287]. In this way, the preference information of the neighbors\ncan be uncovered, or the neighbors\u2019 identities (or sensitive attributes) can be\nrevealed. Other inference attacks in recommender systems work by generating fake\nusers, i.e., sybils, based on the limited knowledge of a victim\u2019s preferences. These\nsybils isolate the victim utilized as a neighbor, and compromise its privacy [49].\nDifferent privacy-preserving technologies have been used to mitigate the users\u2019\nprivacy risks, including homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and differen-\ntial privacy. While homomorphic encryption techniques aim to generate privacy-\naware recommendations by employing encrypted user preference information [286],\nfederated learning techniques build on the assumption that sensitive user infor-\nmation should never leave the user\u2019s device [25,283]. Finally, differential privacy\nprotects the users by introducing noise into the recommendation process [74].\nOur own research focuses on using differential privacy. Additionally, we study\nhow limiting the preference information of users can help to increase privacy.\nTherefore, we use the concept of meta learning [179] to calculate recommenda-\ntions based on a minimal amount of user preference information. With this, we\nstudy privacy constraints of users (e.g., willingness to share preference informa-\ntion) [203].\nWe find that users with small profiles can afford a higher degree\nof privacy than users with large profiles, and that meta learning is helpful for\nincreasing the robustness against the users\u2019 privacy constraints (see Section 3.2).\nDifferentially-Private Recommendations\nThe aim of differentially-private recommendations is to inject randomness and\nnoise into the recommendation calculation process to mitigate the inference risk\n14\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the given text:\n\nHow might the concept of meta learning potentially address the trade-off between privacy and recommendation accuracy in recommender systems?

The lexicalist theories of syntax (Pollard and Sag, 1994; Steedman,\n2000; Bresnan et al., 2016) argue that (1) the key syntactic principles by which words and\nphrases combine are extremely simple and general, and (2) nearly all of the complexity in\nsyntax can be attributed to rich and detailed lexical entries for the words in the language.\nFor example, whereas the relationship between the active and passive voice, e.g., \u201cKim\nsaw a balloon\u201d versus \u201cA balloon was seen by Kim\u201d, was treated in pre-lexicalist theories\nas a special syntactic rule converting between the sentences, in lexicalist theories, this\nrelationship derives simply from the knowledge that the passive participle for the verb\n\u201csee\u201d is \u201cseen,\u201d which interacts with knowledge of other words to make both the active and\npassive forms of the sentence possible. In lexicalist theories, the problem for the language\nlearner thus becomes a problem of learning the words in the language, not a problem of\nlearning numerous abstract rule schemas. The combinatory categorial grammar (CCG;\nSteedman, 2000) framework we use is a well-established example of a lexicalist theory:\nthere is a universal inventory of just three combinatory rules (Figure 6.1a), but those rules\n77\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Given the lexicon entries for \"shiny\" and \"right,\" and using the provided CCG rules, construct the semantic program for the question \"Are there any shiny objects to the right of the green object?\"", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/387cfd0a7aeac9554801ec6ae7c37ae6.png"]}

Jiayuan Mao is the lead author of this work.\nWe now start to consider program execution results as another source of grounding\nsignals and consider using distant supervisions from both vision and program execution\nfor grammar induction. In this chapter, we present Grammar-Based Grounded Lexicon\nLearning (G2L2), a lexicalist approach toward learning a compositional and grounded\nmeaning representation of language from grounded data, such as paired images and texts.\nAt the core of G2L2 is a collection of lexicon entries, which map each word to a tuple of\na syntactic type and a neuro-symbolic semantic program. In Figure 6.1, for example, the\nword shiny has a syntactic type of adjective; its neuro-symbolic semantic program has the\nsymbolic form \u03bbx.filter(x, SHINY), where the concept SHINY is associated with a neural\nnetwork embedding, which will be used to classify shiny objects. Given an input sentence,\nG2L2 first looks up the lexicon entries associated with each token. It then derives the\nmeaning of the sentence as an executable neuro-symbolic program by composing lexical\nmeanings based on syntax. These programs can be executed on grounded inputs. To\nfacilitate learning in an exponentially growing compositional space, we introduce a joint\nparsing and expected execution algorithm (CKY-E2), which does local marginalization\nover derivations to reduce the training time. We evaluate G2L2 on two domains: visual\nreasoning and language-driven navigation. Results show that G2L2 can generalize from\nsmall amounts of data to novel compositions of words.\n76\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the CKY-E2 algorithm facilitate learning in the exponentially growing compositional space within the G2L2 framework?", "response": "", "images": []}

Table 6.3 shows an example where the mode of length 5 is significantly different from all the other modes.\nIt may be impossible to produce a 5 token output that has the right content, but the model \u201cprefers\u201d to output\nsomething grammatical, so we see different content. This is different from the short NMT modes, which were\noften truncated when the constraint was too short to express the content of the source sentence.\nIn order to show that these patterns aren\u2019t just cherry-picked, randomly sampled examples of modal outputs\nare shown in Table B.2. All 30 of the conditional modes are grammatical, relevant to the context, and don\u2019t show\nany evidence of degenerate behavior.

Specifically, the empty sequence is often the modal output, but conditioning on a desired length can yield\nbetter results. The length conditional modes are essentially always grammatical, unlike for the MT model where\nthey were often truncated for shorter target lengths. This is probably because we were able to condition on lengths\nthat were similar to the length of the actual reference continuations, which was not the case for our MT experiments.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time exact and conditional modes have been investigated for a language\nmodel, so this generalizes the prior findings of Stahlberg and Byrne (2019). A priori, we were worried that\nlength-conditional modes from GPT-2 might just be a single word repeated over and over, or a repetition of an\nearlier sentence from the context. The fact that they\u2019re high-quality even for this open-ended task is extremely\nencouraging.\n49\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the relationship between reference length percentile and the percentage of empty modes differ from the relationship between reference sentence length percentile and the probability of empty context?

Prompts are grouped by the decile of the length of the reference response.\nFigure 6.3 shows the same pattern happens with LLaMA as in the earlier experiments: Inputs with longer\nreference lengths have empty modes more often, but the probability of empty outputs either declines or is relatively\nunchanged with length. In Figure 6.3b, Alpaca is the only model that shows a clear trend in terms of empty\nprobability, but even it only changes by a factor of about 2/2\u22120.45 \u22483.\nAs mentioned in Chapter 5, it\u2019s commonly thought that the bad mode problem occurs when a task is less-\nconstrained (meaning there are many correct responses). We don\u2019t have access to multiple references, but we can\nestimate how spread the model\u2019s estimate of output distribution is, then see how that relates to mode emptiness.\nFigure 6.4 shows this relationship, by showing (for each prompt) the logprob of the mode, the average logprob\nover 5 samples10, and whether the modal output is empty.\nThe Alpaca and Guanaco modes support the \u201clevel-of-constraint\u201d hypothesis, with the empty modes only\noccurring when the estimate of the entropy is below some threshold. LLaMA, on the other hand, has empty modes\neven for prompts with fairly low entropies (high sample logprobs). Emitting an EOS token right away is an error for\nthe Alpaca and Guanaco training tasks (conversation/QA), but could actually be correct for the web data LLaMA\nwas trained on.\n6.5.3\nQualitative analysis: Which prompts lead to empty modes?\nInstruction-following is a much more varied task than either MT or story completion, in terms of how constrained\nthe set of responses is. In MT, we\u2019d expect that the entropy of the output roughly scales with the input length.\nWith instruction-following, it\u2019s easy to come up with short inputs that have extremely high output or extremely\nlow entropy.\nIn Chapter 5, we suggested that the bad mode problem shouldn\u2019t be thought of in terms of length, but in terms\nof the entropy of the set of valid outputs. This is often related to length, but can easily be decoupled from it. For\nexample, when prompted with \u201cRecite the Declaration of Independence.\u201d, Alpaca\u2019s global mode is the first 151\ntokens of the preamble, ending with \u201c...to effect their safety and happiness.\u201d On the other hand \u201cWrite a brief\nparagraph of the benefits of attending Arizona State University\u201d is assigned the empty mode. The latter prompt\nhas many valid outputs shorter than 151 tokens, but the entropy of those valid outputs is clearly far higher than the\nentropy of the set of valid responses to the recitation prompt.\nIn the previous section, we quantitatively looked at the relationship between open-endedness and empty modal\noutputs. Here, we also look at it quantitatively by giving more examples of prompts that lead to empty or non-\nempty outputs. Tables B.3, B.4, and B.5 show 10 of each for each of the three LLaMA-based models, which were\nrandomly sampled to avoid cherry-picking.\n10The average log-probability of a sample is just the entropy, so this is an estimate of the negative conditional entropy for a prompt. A lower\nvalue means that the model\u2019s distribution is more spread out for that prompt.\n51\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What trend does the blue line exhibit as the reference length percentile increases, and how does this compare to the trends shown by the other two lines?

For instance, we see in Table 2.3 a context discussing geography and rivers, followed\nby a continuation maintaining the same topic, and we see a context discussing the topic of payment, leading to a\nmention of money in the continuation. Beyond passing of topical information, another success case in the genera-\ntions is passing of certain information about characters between windows\u2014in Table 2.4 we see that pronouns in the\ncontinuations often reflect characters mentioned in the context, and we see an example in which the continuation\nincludes \u201cthe two women\u201d, after a context mentioning \u201cthe aunts\u201d. This behavior was likely learned due to the fact\nthat PG-19 consists of narratives, so correctly passing character information between windows is quite beneficial.\nHowever, these examples also contain discontinuities between the context and the continuation, in terms of\nlocal syntax or facts of the narrative. We see that some sentences are not completed in the expected form (for\ninstance, \u201cThere are lots of ways of being\u201d is continued with a new quote rather than completion of the thought),\nand new characters are sometimes invented rather than continuing to reference those described in the context.\n16\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target tables:\n\nHow much more efficient in terms of FLOPs/token is the recurrent model with 50 overlap compared to the GPT-2 model that achieves the closest test perplexity score?

{"query": "Context:\n\nUnrepresentative training data.\nRelated to the above point, we had to generate the training data using beam\nsearch on LLaMA, rather than sampling. The issue is that there are two things we need for training data to\nbe effective for training an attribute classifier. The first is that it should be representative of the model\u2019s output\ndistribution, Dmodel. The second is that the data should be representative of the types of inputs that the classifier\nwill be used on at inference time.\nThese are conflicting goals, which we can explain with an example.\nConsider the prompt \u201cName three\nscifi/fantasy book series.\u201d Imagine that the beam search completion is \u201c1. Harry Potter, 2. Lord of the Rings,\n3. Foundation.\u201d, and a sample output is \u201cSome popular series are: Mistborn, The Expanse, and The Three Body\nProblem series.\u201d We want the classifier to be able to handle prefixes of the beam search output as input, but its\npredictions are about the sampling output, which has different properties than the beam search output.\nDue to our limited budget, we optimize for input validity over output validity, and use beam search completions\nfrom LLaMA-7B as our training data. The ideal solution would be to use a wide enough range of samples that\nthey achieve good coverage of model behavior, or to use outputs that start by using beam search but sample\ncompletions.20\nFor context on the difference in scales, the recently released LLAMA-2 Chat model was trained using over 1.4\nmillion human preference labels(Touvron et al., 2023b). Using that scale of human labeling, we wouldn\u2019t need to\nmake this compromise in terms of our data distribution.\n7.5.6\nResults\nWe find that, despite the weaknesses in classifier training discussed in the previous section, we\u2019re able to generate\nmuch more acceptable results from LLaMA-7B using conditional beam search than ordinary beam search.\nClassifier satisfaction\nThe easiest measurement we can do is to look at how often the attribute classifiers label complete outputs as having\nsatisfied the target.21 Table 7.4 shows the classifier prediction statistics for the unconditional and conditional\nLLaMA-7B outputs. For both completeness and irrelevance, using conditional beam search satisfies the classifier\nmore often.\nOne thing to point out is that the classifier seems to predict that outputs are complete far more often than they\nactually are.22 Even though it isn\u2019t good in absolute terms, the classifier is still effective in terms of guiding beam\nsearch, as we\u2019ll see in the next few sections.\nImprovement in identified degeneracies\nAt the start of this chapter, we mentioned several problems we observed, namely: empty outputs, repetition of the\nprompt, and emission of unecessary TeX code. These problems were dramatically improved by the addition of\nconditioning.\nTable 7.5 shows the frequency of each problem under each type of beam search.23 The rate of these three un-\ndesired behaviors drops significantly when attempting to condition on Completeness and Relevance. The classifier\nseems to be learning non-trivial behavior, not just lexical rules. For example, given the input \u201cOutput a LaTeX\ntable\u201d, it still TODO.\n7.5.7\nQualitative analysis\nWe\u2019ll now look at some examples of interesting behavior that the conditional beam search outputs show. Ap-\npendix D shows the outputs with and without conditioning for a non-cherrypicked subset of the Dolly-15k prompts.\nResponses to factual but high-entropy prompts\nAs we saw in Chapter 6, inputs with a high-number of possible responses are more likely to have the empty\nsequence as their mode. While we wouldn\u2019t recommend using MAP for something like poetry generation, it\u2019s easy\nto come up with prompts that are requesting concrete factual information, but also have a large number of possible\nresponses. Here\u2019s an example:\n20This latter strategy is the opposite of what VGBS does: He et al.

{"query": "Context:\n\nFor simplicity consider a strictly unimodal length distribution, i.e.:\n\u2113< \u2113\u2217=\n\u21d2p\u2113< p\u2113+1\n\u2113> \u2113\u2217=\n\u21d2p\u2113< p\u2113\u22121\nThis implies that |x\u2217| \u2264\u2113\u2217, since all the sequences longer than \u2113\u2217have lower probability than p\u2113\u2217.\nIf p\u2113grows slowly enough, the right hand side of Equation 5.3.2 will be maximized when \u2113= 0, implying that\nx\u2217= \u03f5, the empty string. The specific condition for this to be the case is:\np\u2113\np0\n< 2\u2113\nSo, if the probability of a given output length grows less than exponentially quickly, the mode will be empty. By\nusing a sufficiently slowly growing sequence, p\u2113, one can have the length of the modal sequence arbitrarily high,\nwhile also having the empty sequence be modal.\nThis distribution is still extremely unrealistic, but it shows one facet of the issue: A single bad sequence with\narbitrarily low quality can still have a higher likelihood than a high-entropy set of good or typical sequences. We\nhaven\u2019t defined a task (so there\u2019s no concept of Sclean), but for all common NLG tasks, this outcome would be an\ninstance of bad atypicality.\n5.3.3\nBland word choice\nOutputs which are too short is just the most obvious case of bad modes, but we can also construct distributions\nwhich have the problem while having constant length. Here we\u2019ll let seqs be instantiations of the template:\n<name><vb.><adj.><noun>, e.g. \u201cJoe eats delicious toast.\u201d For the distribution over S:\n\u2022 For each slot, define a single common word which has probability 10%, and 90 rare words which each have\nprobability 1%\n\u2022 Each slot is filled independently\nNow consider the attribute A(x) = # of rare words in x. The most common attribute value is A(x) = 4, since the\nprobability of all four words being rare is 0.94 \u224866%. On the other hand, the modal string is made of the four\ncommon words, and has probability 1/10000.\nIf we\u2019re interested in quality in the sense of representativeness or creativity, it\u2019s easy to see that this is a bad\nmode. Meister et al. (2022) argue that we should use locally typical sampling to achieve similar information content\nto natural text. On this example, locally typical sampling would lead to outputs which have four rare words, which\nis representative of a typical output.\nOn the other hand, the mode actually globally maximizes BLEU score against a reference randomly sampled\nfrom this distribution. If we look at this example as analogous to the choices a translation system needs to make\nin producing an output, our system would get a higher BLEU score by using the mode than a sampled output.\nMore importantly (maximizing BLEU isn\u2019t very motivating), what kind of translation we want likely depends on\nwhat the translations are for. If every human translator injects their own personal flair or style into translation,\nwe probably want to reflect that in translations of fiction or other works where rhetoric is important. On the other\nhand, in translating technical documentation, a modal translation is probably fine, or even preferable, to one which\nis more natural.\nIn summary, if we want creativity and representativeness, the mode for this distribution is bad. On the other\nhand, if we want outputs which are as \u201cstandard\u201d as possible, the atypicality of the mode can even be beneficial.\n5.3.4\nIndependent errors\nNow we\u2019ll look at a case which is essentially the same as the previous example, but in this case, the atypicality will\nbe desirable rather than harmful.\nConsider a distribution over texts of in which first a text of N sentences is sampled from some high quality\ndistribution, Dclean. Then, define Dtrain as a distribution which takes samples from Dclean introduces a typo into\neach sentence independently with probability pe.\nA typical text will contain Npe typos, but provided that pe is low enough, the most likely sequence should\ncontain zero typos!7 This is mathematically the same as Section 5.3.3, but with \u201csentences with errors\u201d playing the\n7How low pe has to be depends on how likely typos which could have come from multiple different clean texts are.\n38\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the concept of typicality relate to the bad mode problem in the context of natural language generation, and why might atypicality sometimes be beneficial?", "response": "", "images": []}

{"query": "Context:\n\nIntroduction\n3\nMost research on quantum computing applications to AI and NLP consists of cre-\nating a quantum version of existing algorithms. Therefore, these approaches also\nsuffer from the same issues as the classical approaches, including the need for more\ntransparency and cognitive plausibility. In addition, the advantage of using quan-\ntum computing resources is not always clear and usually relies on heuristics.\nIn this work, we aim to address these problems for quantum NLP. By studying\nlinguistic data using the formalisms of quantum mechanics, we create a parallel\nbetween linguistic phenomena and quantum systems, from which we can identify\nwhich features of natural languages would benefit from simulations on quantum\nhardware. We also show that, by using the mathematical frameworks developed to\nstudy quantum mechanics, we can uncover properties of the human disambiguation\nprocess.\nThis thesis uses the mathematics of category theory, in particular the notions of\nsheaves and presheaves. The main reason for doing so is the level of abstraction al-\nlowed by category theory, allowing us to draw parallels between quantum and lin-\nguistic systems. A second motivation is the categorical quantum mechanics research\nproject which originated from the seminal paper of Samson Abramsky and Bob Co-\necke [7]. Indeed, the line of research showed that quantum mechanics can very\nelegantly be described in categorical terms (see more details in Chapter 1).\nOn top of that, this description has also been applied to various aspects of lin-\nguistics, notably in the Distributional Compositional Categorical models of mean-\nings (also known as DisCoCat), which emanated from [42], or as semantics of Dis-\ncourse Representation Theory [8].\nThis thesis is an additional example of the application of categorical quantum\nmechanics in linguistics to ambiguities in the English language. Ambiguities in En-\nglish occur at different levels, from words to discourses. This project investigates\nthe disambiguation process of two types of ambiguities, namely:\n\u2022 Lexical ambiguity which happens when a single word has multiple interpre-\ntations. For example, the word bank, which could refer to a financial institution\nor the bank of a river;\n\u2022 Syntactic ambiguity which happens when a phrase can have multiple gram-\nmatical structures. For example, in the sentence She saw a man with binoculars,\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow does this thesis aim to address the limitations of existing quantum NLP approaches, and what novel perspective does it bring to studying linguistic ambiguities?", "response": "", "images": []}

{"query": "<image><image>Context:\n\n3.6. Key Quantities in NHST\n93\nTreating NHST as a binary decision problem enables us to analyse the different kinds of\nerrors we commit. Of course, we do not know which of the null hypothesis (H0) or the\nalternate hypothesis (H1) is actually true \u2013 otherwise, we do not need a statistical test at all.\nWe can, however, consider what would have happened had either of the hypotheses been\ntrue. This gives us four possible scenarios, as shown below:\nH0 is true\nH1 is true\nTest does not reject H0\nCorrect decision / True negative\nType II error / False negative\nTest rejects H0\nType I error / False positive\nCorrect decision / True positive\nKnowing how often each of the four scenarios happens enables us to quantify the perfor-\nmance of a decision rule. We are usually interested in the Type I and Type II error rates in\nstatistical testing. The former is defined as the chance of committing a Type I error when H0\nis true (see Section 3.6.3), and the latter is defined as the chance of committing a Type II error\nwhen H1 is true (see Section 3.6.4). A good experiment design always controls for these two\ntypes of error, though we will show in Section 3.6.4 that it is more of a trade-off.\nIt is worth noting that many other quantities exist to evaluate different aspects of a decision\nrule. To add to the complication, different communities may refer to the same quantity differ-\nently. For example, readers with a clinical background may recognise specificity (one minus\nthe Type I error rate) and sensitivity (one minus the Type II error rate), while those with a\ncomputer science or machine learning background may be used to precision (one minus the\nfalse positive risk, see Section 3.6.3) and recall (another name for sensitivity). For consistency,\nwe will stick to the terms presented in the table above for the remainder of the section.\n3.6.3\nSignificance level\nThe significance level, as commonly referred to in digital experimentation,28 of an NHST is\ndefined as\n\u03b1 \u225cP(test rejects H0 | H0 is true).\n(3.32)\n28\nStrictly speaking, in statistical theory, Equation (3.32) describes the size of a statistical test, with the signifi-\ncance level being a property of a class of tests [183].

The equivariant\nerror, in fact, is a measure between an element of the symmetry group\n\u02c6\nX \u2208G, and an element of state space \u03be \u2208M, defined in a neighborhood\nof a fixed point \u02da\n\u03be. This construction has motivated the choice to pose the\nfilter state on the symmetry group. The key advantage of such a global\nerror definition is that the error kinematics is linearized about a single set\nof coordinates, whereas in the standard EKF design, the error kinematics\nis linearized about linearization points taken along a time-varying trajectory\nand changing local coordinates.\nIntuition: The difference between the classical and the equiv-\nariant error\nThe classical EKF error for systems with Euclidean state space is\ndefined as e = \u03be \u2212\u02c6\n\u03be. For systems posed on manifolds, the classical\nerror e = \u03be \u229f\u02c6\n\u03be can only be constructed by means of local coordinates\ncentered around the time-varying state estimate \u02c6\n\u03be (t). In contrast, the\nequivariant error is globally defined by construction. Moreover, the\nequivariant error specializes to the classical error definition e = \u03be \u2212\u02c6\n\u03be\nfor M = Rn, G = Rn, \u02da\n\u03be = 0 and the action \u03d5 given by vector addition.\nLet us walk through the main results that characterize the equivariant\nfilter algorithm. The EqF is designed by linearizing the equivariant error\nand solving the Ricatti equation to propagate the error covariance. How-\never, the equivariant error is defined as an element of the homogeneous\nspace M. Hence, local coordinates for the error need to be defined. Simi-\nlarly, the configuration output is, in general, an element of the output space\nN. Therefore, also for the configuration output, local coordinates need to\nbe defined. Consider a system whose state space is a m-dimensional ho-\nmogenous space M, and output space a n-dimensional smooth manifold\nN. Let \u02da\n\u03be \u2208M be the state origin.

Similar\nto Algorithm 3, we will show that any learning algorithm in the standard online setting can be\nconverted to an algorithm in the strategic online setting, with the mistake bound increased by a\nlogarithmic multiplicative factor of \ud835\udc58. The main difference from Algorithm 3 is that now we\nknow \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61before implementing the hypothesis, we do not need to reduce the weight of predicting\npositive by a factor 1/\ud835\udc58as we did in line 4 of Algorithm 3.\nTheorem B.3.

By letting the SOA algorithm by Littlestone, 1988 as the\ninput standard online algorithm \ud835\udc9c, Red2Online-FI(SOA) makes at most \ud835\udc42(Ldim(\u210b) log \ud835\udc58) mistakes.\nProof Let \ud835\udc9cbe an online learning algorithm with mistake bound \ud835\udc40.

This implies that our learner \u210e\ud835\udc61labeled the entire neighborhood of \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61with 0,\nbut \u210e\u2605labels some point in the neighborhood by 1.

The primary challenge\nis that we do not have access to the full information, and predictions of other hypotheses are\nhidden. To extract the information of predictions of other hypotheses, we take advantage of ball\nmanipulations, which induces an ordering over all hypotheses. Specifically, for any hypothesis\n\u210eand feature vector \ud835\udc65, we define the distance between \ud835\udc65and \u210eby the distance between \ud835\udc65and\nthe positive region by \u210e, \ud835\udcb3\u210e,+, i.e.,\n\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65, \u210e) := min{\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65\u2032)|\ud835\udc65\u2032 \u2208\ud835\udcb3\u210e,+} .\n(2.2)\nAt each round \ud835\udc61, given \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61, the learner calculates the distance \ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61, \u210e) for all \u210ein the version space\n(meaning hypotheses consistent with history) and selects a hypothesis \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61such that \ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61) is the\nmedian among all distances \ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61, \u210e) for \u210ein the version space.

In both realizable PAC and online\nsettings, we provide a lower bound with logarithmic dependency on |\ud835\udca2|, demonstrating that\nlog |\ud835\udca2| is inherent (see Theorems 3.3 and 3.7). We further discuss the application of our results\nin the unknown graph setting to the multi-label learning problem, which is of independent\ninterest.\n3.2. Model\n3.2.1. Strategic Classification\nThroughout this work, we focus on the binary classification task in both adversarial online\nsetting and PAC setting. Let \ud835\udcb3denote the feature vector space, \ud835\udcb4= {0, 1} denote the label space,\nand \u210b\u2282\ud835\udcb4\ud835\udcb3denote the hypothesis class. In the strategic setting, an example (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc66), referred to\nas an agent in this context, consists of a pair of feature vector and label. An agent will try to\nreceive a positive prediction by modifying their feature vector to some reachable feature vectors.\nFollowing prior works (e.g., Ahmadi et al., 2023; Lechner and Urner, 2022; Lechner et al., 2023;\nH. Zhang and Conitzer, 2021), we model the set of reachable feature vectors as a manipulation\ngraph \ud835\udc3a= (\ud835\udcb3, \u2130), where the nodes are all feature vectors in \ud835\udcb3. For any two feature vectors\n\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65\u2032 \u2208\ud835\udcb3, there is a directed arc (\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65\u2032) \u2208\u2130from \ud835\udc65to \ud835\udc65\u2032 if and only if an agent with feature\nvector \ud835\udc65can manipulate to \ud835\udc65\u2032. We let \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) = {\ud835\udc65\u2032|(\ud835\udc65, \ud835\udc65\u2032) \u2208\u2130} denote the out-neighborhood of\n\ud835\udc65in graph \ud835\udc3aand \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3a[\ud835\udc65] = {\ud835\udc65} \u222a\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc65) denote the closed out-neighborhood.

{"query": "Context:\n\n2. Strategic Classification for Finite Hypothesis\nClass\n2.1. Introduction\nStrategic classification addresses the problem of learning a classifier robust to manipulation and\ngaming by self-interested agents (Hardt et al., 2016). For example, given a classifier determining\nloan approval based on credit scores, applicants could open or close credit cards and bank\naccounts to increase their credit scores. In the case of a college admission classifier, students may\ntry to take easier classes to improve their GPA, retake the SAT or change schools in an effort to be\nadmitted. In both cases, such manipulations do not change their true qualifications. Recently, a\ncollection of papers has studied strategic classification in both the online setting where examples\nare chosen by an adversary in a sequential manner (Ahmadi et al., 2021, 2023; Y. Chen et al.,\n2020; Dong et al., 2018), and the distributional setting where the examples are drawn from an\nunderlying data distribution (Hardt et al., 2016; Lechner & Urner, 2022; Sundaram et al., 2021;\nH. Zhang & Conitzer, 2021). Most existing works assume that manipulation ability is uniform\nacross all agents or is known to the learner. However, in reality, this may not always be the\ncase. For instance, low-income students may have a lower ability to manipulate the system\ncompared to their wealthier peers due to factors such as the high costs of retaking the SAT or\nenrolling in additional classes, as well as facing more barriers to accessing information about\ncollege (Milli et al., 2019) and it is impossible for the learner to know the highest achievable GPA\nor the maximum number of times a student may retake the SAT due to external factors such as\nsocio-economic background and personal circumstances.\nWe characterize the manipulation of an agent by a set of alternative feature vectors that she can\nmodify her original feature vector to, which we refer to as the manipulation set. Ball manipulations\nare a widely studied class of manipulations in the literature, where agents can modify their\nfeature vector within a bounded radius ball. For example, Y. Chen et al. (2020), Dong et al.\n(2018), and Sundaram et al. (2021) studied ball manipulations with distance function being\nsome norm and Ahmadi et al. (2023), Lechner and Urner (2022), and H. Zhang and Conitzer\n(2021) studied a manipulation graph setting, which can be viewed as ball manipulation w.r.t.\nthe graph distance on a predefined known graph.\nIn the online learning setting, the strategic agents come sequentially and try to game the current\nclassifier. Following previous work, we model the learning process as a repeated Stackelberg\ngame over \ud835\udc47time steps. In round \ud835\udc61, the learner proposes a classifier \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61and then the agent, with\na manipulation set (unknown to the learner), manipulates her feature in an effort to receive\npositive prediction from \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61. There are several settings based on what and when the information\nis revealed about the original feature vector and the manipulated feature vector in the game. The\nsimplest setting for the learner is observing the original feature vector before choosing \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61and\nthe manipulated vector after. In a slightly harder setting, the learner observes both the original\nand manipulated vectors after selecting \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61. An even harder setting involves observing only the\nmanipulated feature vector after selecting \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61. The hardest and least informative scenario occurs\n18\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target text:\n\nHow might the concept of personalized and unknown manipulation sets in strategic classification impact the design of fair and effective learning algorithms, particularly in scenarios with socioeconomic disparities among agents?", "response": "", "images": []}

This, however, only exists in\nthe \u201cutopia case\u201d where there is an infinite set of configuration data samples.\nIn essence, with the design of DaL, the depth \ud835\udc51will manage two conflicting\nobjectives that influence its accuracy:\n1. greater ability to handle sample sparsity by separating the distant samples\ninto divisions, each of which is learned by an isolated local model;\n2. and a larger amount of data samples in each division for the local model to\nbe able to generalize.\nClearly, a larger \ud835\udc51may benefit the ability to handle sample sparsity, but it will\ninevitably reduce the data size per division for a local model to generalize since\nit is possible for CART to generate divisions with imbalanced sample sizes. From\nthis perspective, \ud835\udc51is seen as a value that controls the trade-off between the two\nobjectives, and neither a too small nor too large \ud835\udc51would be ideal, as the former\nwould lose the ability to deal with sample sparsity while the latter would leave\ntoo little data for a local model to learn, hence produce negative noises that harm\nthe overall prediction. This is the key reason that setting \ud835\udc51for a given system is\ncrucial when using DaL.\nUnfortunately, finding the appropriate \ud835\udc51value is not straightforward, as it\noften requires repeatedly profiling different values following in a trial-and-error\nmanner, which can be rather expensive, especially when the optimal \ud835\udc51, which\nleads to the best mean relative error (MRE), varies depending on the system and\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Based on the figures, here's a challenging question:\n\nWhat relationship can be inferred between the depth parameter d and the Mean Relative Error (MRE) across the two software systems shown, and how does this relationship differ between SQLite and Lrzip?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/f2e73229b0708c9e1beb8c38deda321c.png"]}

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\n \nIntroduction \nSmartphones have become inseparable parts of our \ndaily lives. We are always connected; constantly \nchecking e-mails, shopping, streaming videos, surfing \nthe net and so on. Despite the various benefits it offers, \nthis \u201cbeing always connected\u201d situation can have \nnegative effects on our mental health [16,20], physical \nhealth [20] as well as our social relations [10,18].  \nHCI literature provides studies aimed at reducing these \nnegative effects. Majority of these studies, however, \ncommonly preferred strategies helping users to restrict \ntheir smartphone use. For example, AppDetox [12] and \nThe SAMS [11] are two mobile applications which allow \nusers to set rules for the applications they want to use \nless. Let\u2019s FOCUS [6] aims to reduce phone use in \nclassrooms through giving context-aware reminders to \nstudents. Unlike these solutions focusing on individuals, \nLock n' lol [8] and NUGU [9] aim to reduce smartphone \nuse by restricting group members\u2019 smartphone use \ntime. In a similar vein, FamiLync [7] turns use-limiting \naction into a family activity so that each family member \ncan participate in this activity. Others followed a subtler \napproach in terms of giving feedback about excessive \nuse. For instance, LockDoll [3] is a doll that notifies \ngroup members according to phone usage by an \nambient light and by waving its arm. SCAN [14] \nmonitors the  interaction between group members by \nbuilt-in sensors, and defers notifications until it detects \nbreak-points in interactions like a moment of silence. \nAlthough these studies claimed that they decreased \nexcessive smartphone use, the strategies used to \ninfluence user behavior has two limitations. First, \nbehavior change strategies allowing users restrict their \nsmartphone use can only work when 1) the users are \naware of the negative effects of their use-behavior, 2) \nhave an intention to change this behavior [1] and 3) \nhave high levels of self-regulation to maintain this \nchange [21]. Thus, such strategies may fail to mitigate \nsmartphone use of individuals with low level of self-\nregulation, who are more likely to be addicted to their \nsmartphones than individuals with high level of self-\nregulation [4,5]. Second, using these strategies may \neven create unintended outcomes. For example, the \nresults of a recent study showed that teens, who had to \nlimit their social media use involuntarily, experienced \nnegative feelings and increased the time they spend in \nsocial media after the break period was over [2].  \nWe propose an alternative approach to deal with the \nproblem of excessive smartphone use. Inspired by \npractice-based design [17], our approach aims to \ninvestigate the practice of smartphone use and identify \nways of reducing its use without restriction. We \nillustrated this approach with a study on smartphone \nuse during social interaction occurring in public \nsettings. To understand this practice, we first made \nunstructured observations in four coffeehouses and \nthen conducted three focus group sessions with \nparticipants representing three different age groups \n(Table 1). We explored the situations that trigger \nsmartphone use during social interaction, people\u2019s \nmotivations for using and not using their smartphones, \nas well as their feelings and reactions towards people \nwho constantly interact with their phones instead of \nengaging in the conversation. We identified two themes \nbased on this exploration, and discuss implications for \ndesigning interactive solutions that enrich the quality of \nsocial interaction without limiting smartphone use.  \n \nFigure 1. Social Interactions in \ncoffeehouse observations \na) Users who are not using \nsmartphones engage in an \ninteraction. \nb) Smartphone use provides \na medium for an interaction.  \nc) Smartphone use ends the \nusers\u2019 interactions.  \nd) Smartphone use makes \nuser\u2019s responses delayed, \nsuperficial and short. \ne) Users use smartphones to \nenrich their interactions. \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What does the progression of shapes in this diagram suggest about the relationship between the blue circles and yellow rectangles over time?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/77a2a391f985be221bc3e966056db6ee.png"]}

We first read the transcripts to \nfamiliarize ourselves with the data, then we coded them by \nfollowing a deductive approach, using the questions as \ncategories. Then, we re-coded each category by following an \ninductive approach, with codes derived from the data. We \nidentified new categories with this approach. After coding \nthe \nfirst \ntranscripts \nseparately, \nwe \ndiscussed \nthe \ncompatibility of our codes. Then, we continued coding the \nremaining transcripts with agreed upon codes. This analysis \nresulted in five themes, which we explain below. It should \nbe noted that, since our purpose is to collect as many \ndifferent opinions as possible during the focus groups, we did \nnot quantify the number of comments made by each \nparticipant. \nTheme 1: Feeling of curiosity drives phone checking \nbehavior in social settings\nParticipants are aware of the negative effects of smartphone \nuse. However, they accepted that they use their devices in \nsocial settings to share something on social media and to \ncheck notifications or recent updates on their social media \naccounts. The driving force behind this behavior is the \nfeeling of curiosity, which participants mainly associated \nwith their social media accounts. They stated that social \nmedia helps them connect with their friends, family and such \nwithout any need for physical presence. Losing this \nconnection, i.e. being unable to follow what their friends are \ndoing, creates a fear of missing out [41]. They reported that \nthey oftentimes get stressed because of this feeling. \nMoreover, they told that the notifications coming from their \none-to-one or group conversations in WhatsApp fire up this \ncuriosity. Most of the participants approved that the more the \nnumber of notifications (especially successive messages \nfrom group conversations) are, the more these notifications \nstir this feeling. Interestingly, some participants mentioned \nthat they check their smartphones unconsciously. Even \nthough there is no indicator for a notification, they often tend \nto check whether there is a notification. They highlighted that \nthey perform this behavior more when the phone is on the \nsilent mode. \n\u201cWhen the phone is on silent mode, I am pressing the \nhome button to open the screen to see if there is a \nnotification to check. \u2018Is there something to check? \nMaybe I didn't hear it.\u2019 I mean, we have the habit to check \nthe devices unconsciously. This happens very often.\u201d \u2013 \nFemale, Young Adults II \nTheme 2: Checking smartphone in a social gathering \nmakes the companion feel negative emotions \nAlthough participants said that they can use their \nsmartphones during social interaction, they accepted that \nwhen a person checks his or her phone, they feel angry, \noffended, upset, bored, and even worthless. All participants \nagreed that smartphones should not be used while talking \nabout important things such as counseling a friend after a \nbreak-up. They revealed that the frequency and the duration \nof phone checking behavior are crucial in feeling these \nemotions. All groups agreed that this behavior can only be \njustified in situations where using the phone is absolutely \nnecessary such as a call from a family member, school \nmanager or a colleague. \nSince each participant agreed that phone checking occurred \nin a social gathering elicits negative emotions, they use \nvarious tactics to prevent this behavior. If the checking \nbehavior is frequent and long, most of the participants said \nthat they usually warn the person performing this behavior \nverbally. For example, one participant used to warn his \nfriends by ironically saying \u201cYou will exceed your mobile \ndata quota, use mine.\u201d (Male, Middle-aged Adults). Other \nparticipants mentioned that they use \u201cstaring\u201d, \u201ckeeping \nquiet\u201d, \u201cshaking legs\u201d and \u201csighing\u201d as tactics to draw \nattention. Also, some said that they shift their focus onto \nanother thing in such situations or they leave the place. The \nreactions to these breaks in interactions may be more severe. \nFor example, one participant indicated that she used to warn \nher friends by physical coercion, \nPaper 365\nPage 4\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How do the mean ages and standard deviations of the Young Adults I and Young Adults II groups compare between FG1 and FG2 sessions, and what might this suggest about the age distribution within these groups?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/26fc1733d4e93c50a861c74c1de05b99.png"]}

Therefore, the benefit of RtD as a methodological approach in exploring \nsuch a multi-dimensional concept becomes prominent in this thesis.

For example, as we have seen in focus groups, even calling smartphone use \n\"excessive\" can cause users to get defensive and protective of their phones (Chapter 4). \nIn addition, although every participant accepted that the enrichment of social interactions \nwas good for the well-being of users, some perceived a product designed for this purpose \nas a dystopian product.   \nAnother concern was about the privacy and artificiality of the mediated interactions. \nAlmost all respondents said that a product that contributes to their conversations and \nindirectly contributes to their social interactions needs to know their individual needs. \nHowever, the fact that such a device collects digital footprints or listens to users in real-\ntime and interprets the data to nudge them at the right time worried the participants. On \nthe one hand, this data collection raised privacy-related concerns. On the other hand, it \nraises concerns related to the artificiality of the mediated interaction.

If this trend \ncontinues, it could further limit our supply for certain ingredients and we may lose our competitive advantage as it will be more \ndifficult to differentiate ourselves. \nBecause we hold ourselves to such high standards, and because we believe our guests have come to have high expectations of \nus, we may be more severely affected by negative reports or publicity if we fail, or are believed to have failed, to comply with our \nown standards. The damage to our reputation may be greater than other companies that do not have similar values as us, and it \nmay take us longer to recover from such an incident and gain back the trust of our guests. Our mission to Stand For Something \nGood also exposes us to criticism from special interest groups who have different opinions regarding certain food issues or who \nbelieve we should pursue different strategies and goals. Any adverse publicity that results from such criticism could damage our \nbrand and adversely affect guest traffic.\nWe believe that our Stand For Something Good philosophy has been a major contributing factor in our past success because we \nbelieve consumers are increasingly focused on where their food comes from and how it is made, and that consumers want to \nassociate themselves with brands whose ethos matches that of their own. However, if these trends change we may no longer be \nable to successfully compete with other restaurants who share different values than us.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major products and rely on one national distribution company for the \nmajority of our domestic distribution needs. If our suppliers or distributor are unable to fulfill their obligations under our \narrangements with them, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major ingredients, including beef patties, chicken, potato buns, custard, portobello \nmushrooms and cheese sauce. In fiscal 2023, we purchased all of our (i) ground beef patties from 10 approved ground beef \nprocessors, with approximately 41% of our ground beef patties from one supplier; (ii) chicken breasts from two suppliers; \n(iii) potato buns from one supplier; (iv) custard base from two suppliers; (v) 'Shroom Burgers from one supplier; (vi) crinkle cut \nfries from two suppliers; and (vii) ShackSauce from one supplier. Due to this concentration of suppliers, the cancellation of our \nsupply arrangements with any one of these suppliers or the disruption, delay or inability of these suppliers to deliver these major \nproducts to our Shacks may materially and adversely affect our results of operations while we establish alternate distribution \nchannels. In addition, if our suppliers fail to comply with food safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-\ncompliance, their operations may be disrupted. We cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement suppliers on \ncommercially reasonable terms or a timely basis, if at all.\nWe contract with one distributor, which we refer to as our \"broadline\" distributor, to provide virtually all of our food distribution \nservices in the United States. As of December 27, 2023, approximately 95% of certain food and beverage ingredients, including \nchicken, fries and custard, collectively representing 47% of our purchases, were processed through our broadline distributor for \ndistribution and delivery to each Shack. As of December 27, 2023, we utilized 20 affiliated distribution centers and each \nShake Shack Inc.  \n  Form 10-K  |  25\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What does the \"25\" in the bottom right corner of the image likely represent in the context of a Form 10-K document?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/6fdd02f7cf2d39b9155c72ef12da798e.png"]}
{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nEach Shack is designed to convey a consistent brand message while also tailoring marketing efforts to its specific region. We \nmay offer menu items that feature ingredients and beers specific to each Shack's community, and we often team up with local \nchefs and restaurants to offer our guests unique, collaborative menu items. We also collaborate with local artists and designers \nto bring beautiful artwork and installations to our Shacks. We participate in local celebrations and develop relationships within the \ncommunity, helping position Shake Shack as a premium brand that is connected to its neighborhood. \nCommunity and Charitable Partners\nIn addition to special events, we regularly serve our communities in a variety of ways including 25% Donation Days to show \nsupport for local schools and organizations. Guests who participate in these fundraisers have a portion of their order totals \ndonated to a local nonprofit by mentioning the fundraiser when checking out in-Shack or using a fundraiser code on the Shack \napp for pick-up or delivery. Additionally, we provide a Donation Day flyer for the local school or organization to use as an \ninvitation to the community.\nFor certain new Shack openings, we partner with local charities for opening day. In some markets, we have existing tenured \npartnerships with organizations, like Food Bank of the Rockies in Colorado, and in other markets we are building new \nrelationships in our local communities with Shacks we open. At select new Shack openings in fiscal 2023, we donated $1 from \neach designated menu item sold on opening day to the chosen local nonprofit partner. As we continue to grow our footprint \nacross the U.S., our opening day charitable partners are an example of how we continue to drive home our Stand for Something \nGood mission. \nWe listen to our communities and seek opportunities to get involved; whether it is charity events or disaster relief, we are on the \nground helping. We regularly donate cash, food and gift cards to support dozens of local nonprofit organizations, schools, and \nhospitals around the country. For example, in fiscal 2023, we donated approximately $8,000 to local children's hospitals as part \nof Child Health Day and made donations to local food banks, parks, and youth sports through our Shake Shack Pickleball Club \nevent series. We find ways to support charity events such as serving food at Taste of the Cowboys, Alex's Lemonade Stand, \nSouthern Smoke Festival, DC Commanders Holiday Charity Bowling, Love Rocks NYC and so many more.\nEngaging with our Guests \nShake Shack grew up alongside social media and we believe we have benefited from our close relationship with passionate fans \nwho want to engage with us and share their real-time experiences. We're proud to be recognized by media, influencers, and \ncreators alike, garnering attention around the world.\nOur positioning and brand voice, derived from the spirit, integrity and light-hearted nature of Shake Shack, are reinforced by our \ncontemporary, responsible designs and hospitable team members who Stand for Something Good. This identity also anchors our \nmarketing efforts, with the heart of our marketing strategy to provide an uplifting experience while cultivating community and \nconnecting with guests both in our Shacks and through digital channels.  \nSocial Media\nJust as we design our Shacks as community gathering places, our social media strategy creates an online community gathering \nplace. Through our social media presence, we bring Enlightened Hospitality to new audiences by mirroring the in-person \nexperience a guest has when they visit a Shack. We interact with fans across Instagram, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, \nand more by sharing engaging content, comments, replies and the use of user-generated content; a quick search of \n\"#shakeshack\" on Instagram reveals over 1.1 million organic posts from our fans. This year, we doubled down on our creator \npartnerships, expanded our brand storytelling with new types of content and introduced several timely partnerships from Spirit \nHalloween to Universal Pictures. In addition to social media, we also connect with our guests through our email marketing \nprogram via targeted menu item alerts, local event invites, new Shack opening information and other relevant Shake Shack \nnews. \nMedia, Product Placement and Influencers\nShake Shack\u2019s unique positioning has helped us garner robust media coverage across food, lifestyle, business and trade \npublications. We have also been featured across various media outlets, allowing us to increase brand awareness.

If our suppliers or distributor are unable to fulfill their obligations under our \narrangements with them, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs.\n\u25aa\nOur marketing strategies and channels will evolve and our programs may or may not be successful.\n\u25aa\nWe rely on a limited number of licensees for the operation of our licensed Shacks, and we have limited control with \nrespect to the operations of our licensed Shacks, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\n\u25aa\nIf we fail to maintain our corporate culture, our relationships with our team members and guests could be negatively \naffected.\nRisks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry\n\u25aa\nIncidents involving food safety and food-borne illnesses could adversely affect guests' perception of our brand, result in \nlower sales and increase operating costs. \n\u25aa\nRising labor costs and difficulties recruiting and retaining the right team members could adversely affect our business.\n\u25aa\nIncreased food commodity and energy costs could decrease our Shack-level operating profit margins or cause us to limit \nor otherwise modify our menu, which could adversely affect our business.\n\u25aa\nThe digital and delivery business, related expenses, execution and expansion thereof, is uncertain and subject to risk.\n\u25aa\nWe face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely \naffected.\n\u25aa\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of food products could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u25aa\nInflationary environment poses a risk to broader demand for restaurants, including ours.\n\u25aa\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt our \nbusiness, and have materially affected our business, results of operations and our financial condition. \n\u25aa\nThe increasing focus on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could increase our costs, harm our reputation \nand adversely impact our financial results.\nShake Shack Inc.  \n  Form 10-K  |  20\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are some potential risks Shake Shack Inc. faces related to its growth strategies and operations, and how might these risks impact the company's financial performance and reputation?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/ac00d701116f0da823094c5b6a679f33.png"]}

During 2024, we will be transitioning\nto a dealer model from a direct-to-consumer model but expect to operate under both models during 2024. Europe will operate under both models.\nNew Dealer Partnership\nFisker is making this move to scale for significant acceleration of Fisker Ocean deliveries and higher volume production of additional future models. The Dealer Partnership model also aligns\nwith its asset light business strategy.\nThe Fisker dealer strategy is multi-faceted, designed to benefit customers and dealers, as well as Fisker. Fisker dealers will provide retail, service, test drive and delivery functions for Fisker\nvehicles. Fisker dealers will be able to open at a faster pace due to the lower amounts of upfront capital investment versus traditional dealer strategies employed by other OEMs. The reduced facilities\nrelated capital investment is consistent with Fisker\u2019s commitment to sustainability principles: use-less, and re-use. Fisker will offer dealers large market areas and no cost sales and service training\nprograms for early dealer partners for a period of time. Dealers may have service area, back-of-house, and administrative functions for a period of time until the dealer\u2019s operation requires dedicated\nnon-customer facing functions. However, customer facing dealership personnel will be dedicated to Fisker.\nFisker is selecting its dealers based upon multiple criteria, including a dealer\u2019s ability to deliver a high level of customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction will be a key performance metric\nthat dealers will be expected to achieve.\nVehicle Maintenance\nOur vehicles are designed to have no \u201cfirst mandatory service\u201d. We expect service will be needed for mainly two reasons: (1) a fault shows up in the on-board diagnostics/request to go to\nservice, or (2) the customer notices something needs to be \u201cfixed\u201d and service is needed. In each case, we will be alerted by either the vehicle\u2019s on-board diagnostics or the customer and we will then\nrefer the customer to their nearest Fisker dealership.\nFisker Added Value\nFisker's Platform Strategy supports its growth plan objectives, firstly by intelligent re-use of the Ocean platform to define a new EV market segment with the Alaska mid-size EV pick up\n(labelled the Kayak in the EU); followed by the introduction of an all new, lower cost, higher volume, global platform for the PEAR and future derivatives. This new platform features Fisker's novel\n'Steel++' body structure which has 35% less parts than the industry norm due to an intensive focus on component integration and advanced tooling methods.

{"query": "<image><image>Context:\n\nGenie\nEnergy\nDear Fellow Stockholders,\nGenie Energy\u2019s 2023 performance reflected the operational and financial strength of our business as we returned to a \nmore typical operating environment after the extraordinary volatility in global energy prices during 2022.\nWe expanded our retail energy business\u2019s customer base by over 30% in 2023, and did so while generating \n$72\u00a0million of income from operations at Genie Retail. In our Renewables division, we continued to build our solar \ngeneration portfolio, highlighted by the acquisition of 12 operational arrays, while further expanding our project \ndevelopment pipeline and operational capabilities. Also within Renewables, our Diversegy brokerage and CityCom \nSolar community solar businesses both had great\u00a0years. In fact, Diversegy\u2019s revenue more than doubled in 2023 \u2014 \ndriving the 63% year-over-year increase in Renewables revenue.\nConsolidated cash flow from continuing operations totaled $51\u00a0million for 2023, and we returned just about a third \nof that to our stockholders \u2014 redeeming the remainder of our preferred shares and paying our quarterly dividend. \nCash flows were not impacted by the one-time $45.1\u00a0million non-cash charge we took in the fourth quarter for a loss \nreserve at Genie Energy\u2019s newly established captive insurance operations.\nWe enter 2024 in an exceptionally strong position to pursue growth opportunities within both Genie Retail Energy \nand Genie Renewables.\nAt Genie Retail Energy, our expanded customer book will enable us to leverage our operations more effectively \nacross all our markets, and we continue to look for opportunities to further grow our customer base when market \nconditions are favorable. At Genie Renewables, we are scouting for opportunities to expand our portfolio of \noperational solar projects, accelerate work on our current development portfolio including our Perry and Lansing \nNY arrays which we expect to complete this year, and to further build out our operational capabilities. We remain \nvery excited about the potential for solar generation to generate significant, sustained returns for shareholders, and \ngrowing our portfolio of owned generation remains a top strategic priority.\nGenie began 2024 with over $163\u00a0million in cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term restricted cash, and \nmarketable equity securities.

Any \nleasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the useful life. The cost of major additions \nand improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repair costs that do not improve or extend the lives of the \nrespective assets are charged to operations as incurred.\nAsset retirement obligations consist of the Company\u2019s contractual liability for the removal and disposal cost of its \nsolar array systems. These liabilities are recorded at their fair values (which are the present values of the estimated \nfuture cash outflows) in the period in which they are incurred, with an accompanying addition to the recorded cost of \nthe long-lived asset. The asset retirement obligation is accreted each year through a charge to expense. The amounts \nadded to the carrying amounts of the solar array system will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.\nThe estimated useful life of property plant and equipment as follows:\nYears\nMachinery and equipment\n2 \u2013 9\nSolar array system\n14 \u2013 29\nComputer software and development\n2 \u2013 5\nComputers and computer hardware\n2 \u2013 5\nOffice equipment and other\n4 \u2013 27\nThe fair value of patents and trademarks, non-compete agreements and customer relationships acquired in a business \ncombination accounted for under the purchase method are amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows: \npatents and trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10 to 20-year period; non-compete agreements \nare amortized on a straight-line basis 9-year term and licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10-year \nperiod.\nThe Company tests the recoverability of its long-lived assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes \nin circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company tests the \nrecoverability based on the projected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from such asset. If the projected \nundiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company will record an impairment \nloss based on the excess of carrying value over fair value of the assets. The Company generally measures fair \nvalue by considering sale prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows from such asset \nusing an appropriate discount rate. Cash flow projections and fair value estimates require significant estimates and \nassumptions by management. Should the estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company may be \nrequired to record impairments in future periods and such impairments could be material.\nAcquisitions\nResults of operations of acquired companies are included in the Company\u2019s results of operations as of the \nrespective acquisition dates. The purchase price of each acquisition is allocated to the net assets acquired based \non estimates of their fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of these net assets is \nrecorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final \ndetermination of fair values during the measurement period, which may be up to 1 year from the acquisition date.\nFor each acquisition, the Company undertakes a detailed review to identify other intangibles assets and a valuation \nis performed for all such identified assets. The Company uses several market participant measures to determine \nestimated value. This approach includes consideration of similar recent transactions, as well as utilizing discounted \nexpected cash flow methodologies.

These costs consist primarily of consulting, project management services and internal labor, as well as \nother costs associated with our initiatives, such as costs related to facility closures and consolidations. In addition, we have \nrecorded employee severance costs across functional areas. \nWe are currently pursuing several initiatives designed to support our growth strategy and to increase our efficiency, \nincluding several initiatives that we collectively refer to as our North Star program. The goal of these initiatives is to further drive \nshareholder value by (1) expanding our EBITDA growth trajectory, (2) increasing cash flow, (3) paying down debt, and (4) \nimproving our leverage ratio. Our various initiatives include a balanced mix of structural cost reductions focused on \norganizational structure, processes and operational improvements, in addition to workstreams to drive revenue growth. We have \nalready combined like-for-like capabilities, reduced management layers and consolidated core operations to run more efficiently \nand to create the ability to invest in high impact talent to accelerate our growth businesses of payments and data. The associated \ncosts, which consisted primarily of consulting and severance costs, drove the increase in restructuring and integration expense \nduring 2023. Further information regarding restructuring and integration expense can be found under the caption \"Note 9: \nRestructuring and Integration Expense\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this \nreport.\nWe expect that the benefits of the various North Star initiatives will ramp up over the coming quarters. The overall program \ntargets a $100 million run-rate improvement in free cash flow and an $80 million run-rate improvement in adjusted EBITDA by \n2026. Through December 31, 2023, we incurred related restructuring and integration expense of approximately $45 million, and \nwe expect to incur an additional $70 million to $90 million over the next 2 years. These charges will include employee severance, \nprofessional services fees and other restructuring-related charges.\nThe majority of the employee reductions included in our restructuring and integration accruals as of December 31, 2023, \nas well as the related severance payments, are expected to be completed by mid-2024. As a result of our employee reductions, \nincluding those related to our North Star program, we realized cost savings of approximately $7 million in cost of sales and $25 \nmillion in SG&A expense in 2023, in comparison to our 2022 results of operations. For those employee reductions included in our \nrestructuring and integration accruals through December 31, 2023, we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately $8 \nmillion in cost of sales and $25 million in SG&A expense in 2024, in comparison to our 2023 results of operations. In addition, we \nrealized cost savings from facility closures of approximately $3 million in 2023, in comparison to our 2022 results of operations, \nand we anticipate savings of approximately $3 million in 2024, in comparison to our 2023 results of operations. Note that these \nsavings may be offset by increased labor and other costs, including inflationary impacts and investments in the business.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nAs of December 31, 2023, we operated 4 reportable business segments: Payments, Data Solutions, Promotional \nSolutions and Checks.

These assessments inform our annual and \nmulti-year cybersecurity strategies and our product security plans. In addition, our operations depend on a number of third \nparties, including vendors, developers and partners, that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our \ncustomer or employee data. We conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, \nand we have established monitoring procedures in an effort to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents \noriginating from these third parties.\nWe have an Enterprise Risk Management Committee that is led by our Assurance and Risk Advisory Services group, our \nChief Financial Officer and our Chief Administrative Officer, with participation from our executive leadership team and senior-level \nstaff, including our Chief Compliance Officer and the CISO. This committee assesses and monitors our top enterprise risks, \nincluding cybersecurity, and provides quarterly updates to the board of directors. Our CISO also provides periodic updates to the \nfinance and audit committee of the board of directors, which is responsible for ensuring that we have implemented appropriate \nrisk reviews and discusses, with management and the board, our financial and enterprise risk assessment and risk management \npractices and policies, as well as reports to the board any material risks identified in the course of performing its responsibilities. \nIn the event a cybersecurity incident is identified, our Cybersecurity Incident Response team will act in accordance with \nour incident management plans to communicate to our executive leadership team and to coordinate the response to any \nincident. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Technology and Digital Officer, CISO and \nChief Compliance Officer are responsible for assessing such incidents for materiality, ensuring that any required notification or \ncommunication occurs and determining, among other things, whether any prohibition on the trading of our common stock by \ninsiders should be imposed prior to the disclosure of information about a material cybersecurity event. We maintain cybersecurity \ninsurance coverage that insures us for costs resulting from cyberattacks, although this coverage may not reimburse us for all \nlosses.\nAs of the date of this report, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are \nreasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition and that are required to be \nreported in this Form 10-K. For further discussion of the risks associated with cybersecurity incidents see Item 1A, \"Operational \nRisks \u2013 Security breaches, computer malware or other cyberattacks involving the confidential information of our customers, \nemployees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and \nsubstantially harm our business and results of operations.\"\n21\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat potential conflict exists between the company's cybersecurity insurance coverage and its ability to fully mitigate financial losses from cyberattacks, and how might this impact the company's risk management strategy?", "response": "", "images": []}

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to \nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for \nexternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In \nmaking this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission (\"COSO\") in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, we have concluded that, as \nof December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. \nDELUXE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n86\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Analyze Deluxe Corporation's revenue streams from both a product/service and geographic perspective between 2021 and 2023.

For advertising sold through its agents or a \nbroker, as well as for a portion of its programmatic advertising, NRS is the principal because it is responsible for performing \nthe service by delivering advertisements according to the customer\u2019s requirements. For the portion of its programmatic \nadvertising where NRS does not control the ad space before it is provided to the customer, NRS acts as an agent of the \nadvertising exchange. NRS records gross revenues based on the amount billed to the customer when it is the principal in \nthe arrangement and records revenue net of the associated costs incurred when it acts as an agent in the arrangement. The \nperformance obligation is satisfied, and revenue is recognized during the period of time when the advertisement is broadcast \non the POS terminal. \n \nNRS captures targeted, daily data from the POS terminals that it sells to customers. The performance obligation is the \nprovision of a data report, generally one report per POS terminal per week, where each report is a distinct good that is not \ninterrelated with another report. Customers purchase data reports generally for an annual fee per POS terminal. The \nconsideration is variable because it depends on the number of POS terminals selected. The performance obligation is \nsatisfied, and revenue is recognized, at the point in time when the customer receives a data report because the customer \nobtains control and has the benefit of the data. The amount recognized per report is the same for each report since each \nreport has the same standalone value to the customer. \n \nNRS\u2019 merchant services, called NRS PAY, enable retailers to accept and process payments made by credit and debit cards. \nNRS PAY revenue is a monthly fee plus a percentage of the transaction amount plus a flat rate per transaction. There is no \nseparate charge for the credit card reader provided to the retailers, which remains NRS\u2019 property and must be returned \nupon termination of NRS PAY. Merchant services are provided as an agent of the payment processor or funding bank, \ntherefore NRS records revenue net of the associated costs incurred. The performance obligation is satisfied, and revenue \nis recognized when the payment is processed. \n \nThe retailers\u2019 use of the credit card reader is a separate performance obligation that meets the definition of a lease. The \nlease consideration is included in the NRS PAY monthly recurring charge. NRS accounts for the non-lease and lease \ncomponents as a single performance obligation in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Revenue from \nContracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASC 606\u201d) because the timing and pattern of transfer of both components is the \nsame, and the non-lease component is the predominant component. \n \nnet2phone \n \nnet2phone earns revenue primarily through the provision of cloud communications service for businesses. The service is \npriced on a per-seat basis, and its subscription revenue is a monthly fee per seat. Revenue is primarily recognized over the \nmonthly service period. Revenue from the sale of telephone equipment is recognized at a point in time when the equipment \nis delivered to the customer. \n \nnet2phone leases telephone equipment to certain customers, which is a separate performance obligation that meets the \ndefinition of a lease. The lease consideration is included in the monthly recurring charge. net2phone accounts for the non-\nlease and lease components as a single performance obligation in accordance with ASC 606 because the timing and pattern \nof transfer of both components is the same, and the non-lease component is the predominant component. \n \nDisaggregated Revenues \n \nThe following table shows the Company\u2019s revenues disaggregated by business segment and service offered to customers: \n  \nYear ended July 31 \n(in thousands) \n  \n2023    \n2022    \n2021  \nBOSS Money .................................................................. \n \n  $ \n76,928    $ \n55,561 \n    $ \n49,322  \nOther ............................................................................... \n \n    \n9,682      \n9,032 \n      \n8,298  \nTotal Fintech \n............................................................... \n    \n86,610      \n64,593 \n      \n57,620  \nNational Retail Solutions ................................................ \n \n    \n77,115      \n51,299 \n      \n24,748  \nnet2phone \n........................................................................ \n \n    \n72,388      \n58,185 \n      \n44,502  \nIDT Digital Payments ..................................................... \n \n    \n417,057      \n473,215 \n      \n461,609  \nBOSS Revolution Calling \n............................................... \n \n    \n322,134      \n387,937 \n      \n455,244  \nIDT Global \n...................................................................... \n \n    \n230,281      \n292,337 \n      \n360,996  \nOther ............................................................................... \n \n    \n33,269      \n36,491 \n      \n42,271  \nTotal Traditional Communications ............................. \n    \n1,002,741      \n1,189,980 \n      \n1,320,120  \nTOTAL .......................................................................... \n \n  $ \n1,238,854    $ \n1,364,057 \n    $ \n1,446,990  \n \n \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What was the percentage change in revenue for National Retail Solutions from 2021 to 2023, and how does this compare to the percentage change in revenue for net2phone over the same period?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/58d347e726092b84a02f22e1a733a135.png"]}

Further, the loss of such lawsuits could result in financial burdens and the requirement to \nmodify our modes of operation, which could materially adversely affect our business. \n \nWe are subject to tax and regulatory audits which could result in the imposition of liabilities that may or may not have \nbeen reserved. \n \nWe are subject to audits by taxing and regulatory authorities with respect to certain of our income and operations. These \naudits can cover periods for several years prior to the date the audit is undertaken and could result in the imposition of \nliabilities, interest, and penalties if our positions are not accepted by the auditing entity. \n \nOur 2017 FCC Form 499-A, which reports our calendar year 2016 revenue was audited by the Universal Service \nAdministrative Company, or USAC. The Internal Audit Division of USAC issued preliminary audit findings and, in \naccordance with USAC\u2019s audit procedures, we appealed certain of the findings. USAC issued a final decision, and the final \ndecision overturned one of the initial findings but left the remaining initial findings in place. The reversal will result in the \nelimination of a $1.8 million charge by the Universal Service Fund. The final decision upheld the imposition of a $2.9 \nmillion charge to the Federal Telecommunications Relay Service, or TRS, Fund. We have appealed the USAC\u2019s final \ndecision to the FCC. As of July 31, 2023, our accrued expenses included $26.8 million for FCC-related regulatory fees for \nthe year covered by the audit, as well as prior and subsequent years. If we do not properly calculate, or have not properly \ncalculated, the amount payable by us to the FCC, we may be subject to interest and penalties. \n \nWe are subject to value added tax, or VAT, audits from time-to-time in various jurisdictions. In the conduct of such audits, \nwe may be required to disclose information of a sensitive nature and, in general, to modify the way we have conducted \nbusiness with our distributors until the present, which may affect our business in an adverse manner. \n \nWe are also subject to audits in various jurisdictions for various other taxes, including utility excise tax, sales and use tax, \ncommunications services tax, gross receipts tax, and property tax. \n \nOur business is subject to strict regulation under federal law regarding anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist \nfinancing. Failure to comply with such laws, or abuse of our programs for purposes of money laundering or terrorist \nfinancing, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. \n \nProvisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and other federal laws impose substantial regulations on \nfinancial institutions that are designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist organizations. Increasing \nregulatory scrutiny of our industry with respect to money laundering and terrorist financing matters could result in more \naggressive enforcement of these laws or the enactment of more onerous regulation, which could have a material adverse \nimpact on our business. In addition, abuse of our money transfer services or prepaid card programs for purposes of money \nlaundering or terrorist financing, notwithstanding our efforts to prevent such abuse through our regulatory compliance and \nrisk management programs, could cause reputational or other harm that would have a material adverse impact on our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \n \nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations intended to help detect and prevent illegal or illicit \nactivity and our failure, or the failure of one of our disbursement partners or payment processors to comply with those \nlaws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \n \nOur BOSS Money and network branded prepaid card services are subject to a strict set of legal and regulatory requirements \nintended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other illicit activity. The interpretation \nof those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with little \nnotice. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, or OFAC, prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, \nand in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, \nnarcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. As federal, state, and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny \nand enforcement action in these areas increase, we expect our costs to comply with these requirements will increase, \nperhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these requirements by us, our regulated retailers or our disbursement \npartners could result in the suspension or revocation of a money transmitter license, the limitation, suspension or \ntermination of our services, the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, \nincluding fines. \n \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential financial and operational consequences for the company if it fails to adapt its compliance systems to evolving anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, particularly in the context of its BOSS Money and prepaid card services?", "response": "", "images": []}

Significant assumptions used in the valuations included Linxis\u2019 cash \nflow projections, which were based on estimates used to price the Linxis acquisition, discount rates that were benchmarked with \nreference to the implied rate of return to the Company\u2019s pricing model, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital \n(12%).\nThe amounts allocated to intangible assets are as follows:\nGross Carrying \nAmount\nWeighted-Average \nUseful Life\nCustomer relationships\n$ \n211.1 \n13 years\nTrade name\n \n32.7 \n10 years\nTotal intangible assets\n$ \n243.8 \nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the \nestimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately \nrecognized.  The factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill were based on strategic benefits that are expected to be \nrealized from the acquisition.  None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. \nThe working capital assets and liabilities, as well as the property, plant and equipment acquired, were valued using Level 2 \ninputs, which included data points that are observable, such as definitive sales agreements, appraisals or established market \nvalues of comparable assets (market approach). Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were valued using Level 3 inputs, \nwhich are unobservable by nature, and included internal estimates of future cash flows (income approach). Significant increases \n(decreases) in any of those unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value \nmeasurement.

{"query": "Context:\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2023 \n91\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make informed judgments, \nassumptions, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base our \nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the \ncircumstances. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual \nresults may differ from these estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and \noperating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters \nwhich are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the \naccounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and Significant \nAccounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nImpairments\nMethodology  We review our long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Although the carrying amount may exceed the \nestimated fair value of certain properties, a real estate asset is only considered to be impaired when its carrying amount is \nnot expected to be recovered through estimated future undiscounted cash flows. To the extent an impairment provision is \nnecessary, the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is expensed to operations and the \ncarrying amount of the asset is reduced. The adjusted carrying amount, which represents the new cost basis of the asset, \nis depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset or, for MPCs, is expensed as a cost of sales when land is sold.\nJudgments and uncertainties  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable \nand exceeds its fair value. The cash flow estimates used both for determining recoverability and estimating fair value are \ninherently judgmental and reflect current and projected trends in rental, occupancy, pricing, development costs, sales \npace, capitalization rates, selling costs, and estimated holding periods for the applicable assets. As such, the evaluation of \nanticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions that could differ materially from actual \nresults in future periods. Unfavorable changes in any of the primary assumptions could result in a reduction of anticipated \nfuture cash flows and could indicate property impairment. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions could affect \nthe timing of an impairment. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have \na material impact on our financial results.\nMaster Planned Communities Cost of Sales\nMethodology  When residential or commercial land is sold, the cost of sales includes actual costs incurred and estimates \nof future development costs benefiting the property sold. When land is sold, costs are allocated to each sold superpad or \nlot based upon the relative sales value. For purposes of allocating development costs, estimates of future revenues and \ndevelopment costs are re-evaluated throughout the year, with adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining \nparcels available for sale. For certain parcels of land, including acquired parcels that the Company does not intend to \ndevelop or for which development was complete at the date of acquisition, the specific identification method is used to \ndetermine the cost of sales.\nJudgments and uncertainties  MPC cost of sales estimates are highly judgmental as they are sensitive to cost \nescalation, sales price escalation, and pace of absorption, which are subject to judgment and affected by expectations \nabout future market or economic conditions. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate future development costs \ncould result in a significant impact on the amounts recorded as cost of sales.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nPlease refer to Note 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to \nConsolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information about new accounting \npronouncements.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nTable of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\nHHH 2023 FORM 10-K  |  60\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow might changes in market conditions or economic expectations impact the company's financial statements, particularly in relation to their critical accounting policies for impairments and Master Planned Communities cost of sales?

As a result of the conversion, the \nCompany reclassified the amount of convertible preferred stock to additional paid-in capital.\nSubsequent Event: Rights Agreement\n\u00a0\nOn March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a Rights Agreement (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d) in order to protect the Company and its shareholders from coercive \nor otherwise unfair takeover tactics. The Rights Agreement imposes a significant penalty upon any person or group (including a group of persons that are acting \nin concert with each other) that acquires 15% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, including through derivatives agreements, without the \napproval of the Company. The Rights Agreement should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Company.\n\u00a0\nIn connection with the Rights Agreement, the Company declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (\u201cRight\u201d) for each outstanding share of the \nCompany\u2019s common stock. The dividend is payable to shareholders of record on March 14, 2024. In addition, one Right will automatically attach to each share \nof the Company\u2019s common stock until the date in which the Rights become exercisable, redeemed, or expired.\n\u00a0\nThe Rights will initially trade with, and will be inseparable from, the Company\u2019s common stock. Each Right will allow its holder to purchase from the \nCompany one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (\u201cPreferred Shares\u201d), for $5.35, subject to \nadjustment under certain conditions, once the Rights become exercisable. This portion of a share of Preferred Stock would give the holder thereof \napproximately the same dividend, voting, and liquidation rights as would one share of the Company\u2019s common stock. Prior to exercise, the Right does not give \nits holder any dividend, voting, or liquidation rights.

In connection with the Tailwind Two Merger, the Company terminated the 2014 Plan and adopted the Terran Orbital Corporation 2021 Omnibus \nIncentive Plan (the \u201c2021 Plan\u201d), under which the Company grants share-based compensation awards to certain employees, officers, directors, and consultants. \nAll of the outstanding share-based compensation awards granted under the 2014 Plan were cancelled and substituted for share-based compensation awards \nunder the 2021 Plan in the same form and on substantially the same terms and conditions.\nShare-based compensation expense for service-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that include a \nperformance condition, share-based compensation expense is recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be met.

The Retention RSUs expire five years from the Tailwind Two Merger if unvested. The derived service period for \nthe majority of the Retention RSUs was estimated to be less than one year from the date of the Tailwind Two Merger based on the median weighted-average \ntriggering event period determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model. As such, the share-based compensation expense associated with the Retention \nRSUs is generally recognized over a one-year period beginning from the consummation of the Tailwind Two Merger. In addition, the grant date fair value of the \nRetention RSUs was determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model using the following significant inputs and assumptions as of the valuation date: (i) the \nprice per share of Terran Orbital Corporation\u2019s common stock, (ii) a risk-free interest rate ranging from 1.61% to 2.88%, (iii) a dividend yield of 0%, (iv) an \nestimated volatility of 40%, and (v) a discount for lack of marketability ranging from 4.50% to 6.50% for Retention RSUs granted prior to the Tailwind Two \nMerger.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of Retention RSUs granted during 2022 was $7.98.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to Retention RSUs during 2023:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNumber of RSUs\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\n\u00a0\nUnvested as of December 31, 2022\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n4,135,052 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n7.89 \u00a0\nGranted\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2014 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u00a0\nVested\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2014 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2014 \u00a0\nForfeited\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(796,594 ) \u00a0\n\u00a0\n7.65 \u00a0\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n3,338,458 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n7.95 \u00a0\nAs of December 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation cost related to Retention RSUs was $155 thousand, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 0.8 years.\nStock Options\nStock options are primarily service-based awards that vest over a two- or four-year period from the date of grant, have an exercise price based on the estimated \nfair value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and have a contractual term of up to ten years from the date of grant.

We are able to identify the vast majority of our \ncustomers primarily through our robust loyalty program, which gives us access to extensive customer and sales data. We have \nimproved our customer tracking capabilities and have maintained the proportion of our net sales attributable to active customers \nover time. The proportion of net sales, excluding PLCC Funds (as defined in \u201cNote 2\u2013Summary of Significant Accounting \nPolicies\u201d), that we are able to attribute to active customers was 97% for each of fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. We view the \nnumber of active customers as a key indicator of our performance, the reach of our e-Commerce and stores platform, the value \nproposition and consumer awareness of our brand and our customers' desire to purchase our products. \nNet Sales per Active Customer. We define net sales per active customer for any given period as the net sales in the \npreceding four quarters, divided by the total number of active customers at the end of that period.

The recognition of PLCC Funds (as defined in \u201cNote 2\u2013Summary of Significant Accounting \nPolicies\u201d) in net sales is preferable because it will enhance the comparability of our financial statements with those of many of \nour industry peers and provide greater transparency into performance metrics relevant to our industry by showing the gross \nimpact of the funds received as net sales instead of as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet Sales. Net sales reflects our revenues from the sale of our merchandise, shipping and handling revenue received from \ne-Commerce sales, PLCC Funds (as defined in \u201cNote 2\u2013Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d) and gift card breakage \nincome, less returns, discounts and loyalty points/awards. Revenue from our stores is recognized at the time of sale and revenue \nfrom our e-Commerce channel is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the home of the customer; except in cases \nwhere the merchandise is shipped to a store and revenue is recognized when the customer retrieves the merchandise from the \nstore. Net sales are impacted by the size of our active customer base, product assortment and availability, marketing and \npromotional activities and the spending habits of our customers. Net sales are also impacted by the migration of single-channel \ncustomers (i.e., customers shopping only in-store or online) to omni-channel customers (i.e., customers shopping both in-store \nand online), who on average spend significantly more than single-channel customers in a given year.\nGross Profit. Gross profit is equal to our net sales less cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold includes merchandise \ncosts, freight, inventory shrinkage, payroll expenses associated with the merchandising department, distribution center expenses \nand store occupancy expenses, including rent, common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes and depreciation. \nMerchandising payroll costs and store occupancy costs included within cost of goods sold are largely fixed and do not \nnecessarily increase as volume increases. We review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow-moving \nmerchandise and generally use markdowns to clear that merchandise. The timing and level of markdowns are driven primarily \nby customer acceptance of our merchandise. The primary drivers of our merchandise costs include the raw materials, labor in \nthe countries where we source our merchandise, customs duties, and logistics costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs \nnot included in cost of goods sold or marketing expenses. \nMarketing Expenses. We continue to make investments in marketing in an effort to grow and retain our active customer \nbase and increase our brand awareness. Marketing expenses consist primarily of (i) targeted online performance marketing \ncosts, such as retargeting, paid search/product listing advertising, and social media advertisements, (ii) store and brand \nmarketing, public relations and photographic production designed to acquire, retain and remain connected to customers and (iii) \npayroll and benefits expenses associated with our marketing team.\nInterest Expense.  Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense and other fees associated with our Existing \nABL Facility, as amended, and New Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes consists of an estimate of federal and state income taxes \nbased on enacted federal and state tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions and uncertain tax positions.\n37\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow might the company's change in accounting policy for PLCC Funds impact the analysis of its financial performance compared to industry peers, and what potential risks or benefits could this change introduce?", "response": "", "images": []}
{"query": "Context:\n\nvalue of these incentive units as a capital contribution from our former parent, Torrid Holding LLC, as our former parent is the \nlegal obligor for the incentive units.\nThe incentive units were valued utilizing a contingent claims analysis (\"CCA\") methodology based on a Black-Scholes \nOPM. Under the OPM, each class of incentive units was modeled as a call option with a unique claim on the assets of Torrid \nHolding LLC. The characteristics of each class of incentive units determined the uniqueness of the claim on the assets of Torrid \nHolding LLC. The OPM used to value the incentive units incorporated various assumptions, including the time to liquidity \nevent, equity volatility and risk-free interest rate of return. Equity volatility was based on the historical volatilities of \ncomparable publicly traded companies for the time horizon equal to the time to the anticipated liquidity event; and the risk-free \ninterest rate was for a term corresponding to the time to liquidity event. The assumptions underlying the valuation of the \nincentive units represented our best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. The \nmost recent remeasurement of the fair value of the incentive units utilizing the CCA methodology was performed as of May 1, \n2021. Following the pricing of our IPO, the vested portion of the incentive units was exchanged for shares of our common stock \nof an equivalent fair value as the vested incentive units and the unvested portion was cancelled. As such, the fair value of these \nincentive units is no longer recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares \noutstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is applicable only in periods of net income and is computed by dividing \nnet income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and potentially dilutive common \nshare equivalents outstanding for the period. Periods of net loss require the diluted computation to be the same as the basic \ncomputation, as all potentially dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive. \nEmployee Benefit Plan\nOn August 1, 2015, we adopted the Torrid 401(k) Plan (\"401(k) Plan\"). All employees who have been employed by us \nfor at least 200 hours and are at least 21 years of age are eligible to participate. Employees may contribute up to 80% of their \neligible compensation to the 401(k) Plan, subject to a statutorily prescribed annual limit.

During fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, we contributed 50% of the first 4% \nof participants' eligible contributions into their 401(k) Plan accounts.

The \nDeferred Compensation Plan provides participants with the opportunity to defer up to 80% of their base salary and up to 100% \nof their annual earned bonus, all of which, together with the associated investment returns, are 100% vested from the outset. \nThe Deferred Compensation Plan is designed to be exempt from most provisions of the Employee Retirement Security Act of \n1974, as amended. All deferrals and associated earnings are our general unsecured obligations. We may at our discretion \ncontribute certain amounts to eligible employees' accounts. During fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, to the extent participants \nwere ineligible to receive contributions from participation in our 401(k) Plan, we contributed 50% of the first 4% of \nparticipants' eligible contributions into their Deferred Compensation Plan accounts. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, \n2023, we did not have any assets of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the associated liabilities were $5.6 million and $5.6 \nmillion, respectively, included in our consolidated balance sheets. As of February 3, 2024, $0.1 million of the $5.6 million \nDeferred Compensation Plan liabilities were included in accrued and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. \nAs of January 28, 2023, $1.4 million of the $5.6 million Deferred Compensation Plan liabilities were included in accrued and \nother current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.\nNote 3.

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of\ndrillships, semi-submersible rigs, and jackup rigs for operations in shallow to ultra-deepwater in both benign and harsh environments. We contract our drilling units to drill wells\nfor our customers on a dayrate basis. Our customers include oil super-majors, state-owned national oil companies, and independent oil and gas companies. In addition, we\nprovide management services to certain affiliated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned a total of 19 drilling rigs, of which 15 were operating (inclusive of three leased to the Gulfdrill joint venture and one leased to the Sonadrill\njoint venture), three were cold stacked and one was warm stacked. The 15 operating units include ten floaters (comprising seven 7th generation drillships and three 6th\ngeneration drillships), two harsh environment units (comprising one semi-submersible unit and one jackup) and three jackups. In addition to our owned assets, as of December\n31, 2023, we managed two rigs owned by Sonangol.\nWe are recognized for providing high quality operations, in some of the most challenging sectors of offshore drilling. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately\n2,500 employees across the globe. We are incorporated in Bermuda and have worldwide operations based on where activities are conducted in the global oil and gas industry.\n2) Our Fleet\nOur relatively modern fleet, amongst the youngest in the industry, is well positioned compared with other major offshore drillers. As of December 31, 2023, our owned fleet was\n19 drilling units which included ten drillships, four semi-submersible rigs and five jackup rigs. For additional information on our drilling units and newbuildings refer to Item 4D\n- \"Property, Plant and Equipment\".\nWe categorize the drilling units in our fleet as (i) floaters, (ii) jackups and (iii) harsh environment. This is further explained below.\na) Floaters\ni.\nDrillships:\nDrillships are self-propelled ships equipped for drilling offshore in water depths ranging from 1,000 to 12,000 feet and are positioned over the well through a computer-\ncontrolled thruster system. Drillships are suitable for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load-carrying capacity. Depending on the country of\noperation, drillships operate with crews of 120 to 160 people.\nii.\nSemi-submersible drilling rigs:\nSemi-submersibles consist of an upper working and living quarters deck connected to a lower hull consisting of columns and pontoons. Such rigs operate in a \"semi-submerged\"\nfloating position, in which the lower hull is below the waterline and the upper deck protrudes above the surface. The rig is situated over a wellhead location and remains stable\nfor drilling in the semi-submerged floating position, due in part to its wave transparency characteristics at the water line.\nSemi-submersible rigs can be either moored or dynamically positioned. Moored semi-submersible rigs are positioned over the wellhead location with anchors and typically\noperate in water depths ranging up to 1,500 feet. Dynamically positioned semi-submersible rigs are positioned over the wellhead location by a computer-controlled thruster\nsystem and typically operate in water depths ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 feet. Depending on the country of operation, semi-submersible rigs generally operate with crews of\n110 to 130 people.\n24\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What was the total capital expenditure for Seadrill in 2022, considering both the Successor and Predecessor periods?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/2229d5630fde8c400be8e5aa22ec9198.png"]}
{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 \u2013 Chapter 11\nSeadrill Chapter 11 Process\ni. Chapter 11 filing\nThe Debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under the Chapter 11 proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court on February 7, 2021 and February 10, 2021 (the \"Petition\nDate\"). These filings triggered a stay on enforcement of remedies with respect to our debt obligations.\nThese filings excluded the Seadrill New Finance Limited group (\"NSNCo\"), as Seadrill and the NSNCo noteholders negotiated a refinancing outside of this bankruptcy.\nii. Plan of Reorganization\nOn July 23, 2021, the Company entered into a Plan Support and Lock-Up Agreement (the \"Plan Support Agreement\") with certain holders of claims under the Company\u2019s 12\nprepetition credit facilities (the \"Prepetition Credit Agreements\"), and Hemen Holdings Ltd (\"Hemen\"). On July 24, 2021, the Company filed the first versions of the Joint\nChapter 11 Plan of Reorganization and Disclosure Statement. On August 31, 2021, the Company filed the First Amended Plan of Reorganization and the First Amended\nDisclosure Statement (the \"Disclosure Statement\") and on September 2, 2021, the Court approved the First Amended Disclosure Statement (as Modified) and the solicitation of\nthe Plan of Reorganization. On October 11, 2021, the Company\u2019s creditor classes voted to accept the plan of reorganization. On October 26, 2021, Seadrill\u2019s Plan of\nReorganization (the \"Plan\") was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.\niii. Amendment to terms of existing facilities\nThe Plan, among other things, provided that holders of allowed Credit Agreement claims (a) received $683\u00a0million (adjusted for the Asia Offshore Drilling Limited (\"AOD\")\ncash out option) of take-back debt (the \"Second Lien Facility\") and (b) were entitled to participate in a $300\u00a0million new-money raise under a first lien facility (the \"First Lien\nFacility\"), and (c) received 83.00% of pre-diluted equity in successor Seadrill on account of their allowed Credit Agreement claims, and 16.75% of equity in successor Seadrill\nfor such holders participation in a rights offering (the \"Rights Offering\").\niv. Rights Offering and backstop of new $300\u00a0million facility\nHolders of the subscription rights, which included the backstop parties (the \"Backstop Parties\" and together, the \"Rights Offering Participants\"), received the right to lend up\nto $300\u00a0million under the First Lien Facility. The Rights Offering Participants also received, in consideration for their participation in the Rights Offering, 12.50% of the issued\nand outstanding pre-diluted Shares as of the Effective Date. The First Lien Facility was structured as (i) a $175\u00a0 million term loan (the \"Term Loan Facility\") and (ii) a\n$125\u00a0million revolving credit facility.\nAs consideration for the backstop commitment of each Backstop Party, the Backstop Parties were (a) issued 4.25% of the issued and outstanding pre-diluted Shares as of the\nEffective Date (the \"Equity Commitment Premium\"); and (b) paid in cash a premium (the \"Commitment Premium\") equal to 7.50% of the $300\u00a0million in total commitments\nunder the First Lien Facility. The Commitment Premium was revised to $20\u00a0million and paid within one business day following the backstop approval order on October 27,\n2021.\nv. Hemen $50\u00a0million convertible bond\n$50\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of convertible bond (the \"Convertible Bond\") was issued to Hemen at par upon emergence. The Convertible Bond is convertible into\nShares (the \"Conversion Shares\") at an initial conversion rate of 52.6316 Shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Bond, subject to certain adjustments. The\nConvertible Bond is convertible (in full and not in part) into the Conversion Shares at the option of the lender on any business day that is ten business days prior to the maturity\nof the Convertible Bond.\nManagement considered the accounting treatment for the Conversion using the embedded derivative model, substantial premium model, and the no proceeds allocated model.\nThe Company determined that on the Effective Date that the substantial premium model was applicable, and the recognition of the Convertible Bond should follow the treatment\nprescribed under this model. Pursuant to the substantial premium model, the principal was recorded as a liability at par and the excess premium was recorded to additional paid-\nin-capital.\nvi. Emergence and New Seadrill equity allocation table\nSeadrill met the requirements of the Plan and emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings on the Effective Date.\nUnder the Plan and prior to any equity dilution on conversion of the convertible bond, the Company issued 83.00% of the Company\u2019s equity to Credit Agreement claimants,\n12.50% to the Rights Offering Participants, 4.25% to the Backstop Parties through the Equity Commitment Premium, and the remaining 0.25% to Class 9 Predecessor\nshareholders.

We refer you to the notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the basis on which the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared.\n1) Introduction\nWe are an offshore drilling contractor providing worldwide offshore drilling services to the oil and gas industry. For a detailed description of our business please read Item 4B -\n\"Business Overview\".\n2) Acquisition of Aquadrill LLC\nOn April 3, 2023, Seadrill completed the acquisition of Aquadrill. Refer to Note 31 \u2013 \"Business combinations\" for further details.\nAs a result of the Merger, Seadrill acquired Aquadrill\u2019s four drillships, one semi-submersible and three tender-assist units. On May 19, 2023, Seadrill entered into definitive sale\nand purchase agreements to sell the three tender-assist units, acquired in the Merger. The sale completed on July 28, 2023.\nIn connection with this acquisition, the Company incurred $24\u00a0million and $3\u00a0million of merger and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the\nperiod from February\u00a023, 2022 through December\u00a031, 2022 (Successor), respectively. In addition, the Company incurred $4 million of issuance costs which have been reflected\nagainst the fair value of the Shares as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity.\nWe used a convenience date of April 1, 2023 (the \"Convenience Date\") to account for this acquisition and have recorded activity from the Convenience Date in Seadrill's annual\nresults.\nThe Merger is accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805,\nBusiness Combinations, with Seadrill being treated as the accounting acquirer. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded on Seadrill\u2019s consolidated balance sheet\nat their respective fair values. As a result of the acquisition, drilling units at a value of $1,252\u00a0million were recorded on the Seadrill balance sheet as well as intangible assets and\nliabilities related to drilling and management service contracts that had favorable and unfavorable terms compared to the current market at the Closing Date. The Company\nrecorded the fair value adjustment for the off-market contract liabilities and assets to \"Other current liabilities\", \"Other current assets\", and \"Other non-current assets\" in the\namounts of $49\u00a0million, $6 million, and $1 million, respectively.\nOn closing of the merger, Seadrill assumed arrangements related to the management of the former Aquadrill rigs governed by management service agreements (\"MSAs\").\nUnder the MSAs, former Aquadrill rigs are chartered to an MSA Manager, who contracts with a third-party customer to provide drilling services. The MSA Manager initially\nbears all costs required for those services. All revenues from the end customer and all contract expenses are passed on to Seadrill and the MSA Manager charges a fee for the\nservices provided.\nWe recognize all revenues from the end-customer and all operating expenses incurred by the MSA Manager (and reimbursed by Seadrill), along with all MSA Manager fees. In\naddition, where the MSA Manager incurs capital or long-term maintenance expenditures under these arrangements, the costs are passed to Seadrill and accounted for as drilling\nunit additions.\n3) Discontinued operations\nDisposal of interest in Paratus Energy Services Ltd\nIn January 2022, Seadrill disposed of 65% of its equity interest in PES. This sale represented a strategic shift in Seadrill's operations, significantly affecting its ongoing\noperations and financial results. As a result, we reclassified PES as a discontinued operation, and its results were reported separately from Seadrill\u2019s continuing operations in the\ncomparative periods.\nAdditionally, on September 30, 2022, Seadrill entered into share purchase agreements with certain other existing shareholders of PES to dispose of the remaining 35%\nshareholding in PES. The sale closed on February 24, 2023.\nFor further details on the PES disposal, please see Note 30 \u2013 \"Discontinued Operations\" of the accompanying financial statements.\nSale of jackup units in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nOn September 1, 2022, Seadrill entered into a share purchase agreement with subsidiaries of ADES Arabia Holding Ltd (together, \"ADES\") for the sale of the entities that own\nand operate seven jackup units (the \"Jackup Sale\") in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the \"KSA Business\"). The Jackup Sale closed on October 18, 2022, with ADES now\nowning the rigs AOD I, AOD II, AOD III, West Callisto, West Ariel, West Cressida, and West Leda, as well as the drilling contracts related to the rigs. ADES also now employs\nthe crews operating the rigs in Saudi Arabia.\nThe sale represented a strategic shift in Seadrill's operations which will have a major effect on its operations and financial results going forward and therefore we reclassified the\nKSA Business, previously included within our Jackup segment, as a discontinued operation and its results have been reported separately from Seadrill\u2019s continuing operations in\nall periods. In addition, the assets and liabilities of the KSA Business were reclassified as held for sale as of September 1, 2022. We ceased all depreciation and amortization of\nheld for sale non-current assets at the point they qualified as held for sale.\n30\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow did Seadrill's acquisition of Aquadrill and subsequent divestitures in 2023 impact the company's fleet composition and financial reporting?

{"query": "Context:\n\n \nis performed as of September 1st, and an assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair \nvalue of the asset below its carrying value.  The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment and concludes if it is more likely than not \nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value is less than \nthe carrying value, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.  If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the \nreporting unit is less than the carrying value, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is required.  Step one of the impairment assessment compares the fair value of the \nreporting unit to its carrying value and if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value \nof goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value exceeds the carrying value then goodwill is not impaired; otherwise, an impairment loss \nwould be recorded by the amount the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.  \nLeases\nAt the inception of a lease arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances \npresent in the arrangement.  Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as a right-of-use (ROU) assets and as short-term and long-term \nlease liabilities, as applicable.

The Company typically only includes an initial \nlease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement.  Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company\u2019s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the \nCompany will renew.\nIncome Taxes \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement \ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to \nbe recovered or settled.  The Company records a valuation allowance when it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that all of the future income tax benefits will not be realized.  When \nthe Company changes its determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized, the valuation allowance is adjusted with a corresponding impact \nto income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.  The ultimate realization of the Company\u2019s deferred income tax assets depends upon generating \nsufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company projects future levels of taxable income.  \nThis assessment requires significant judgment.  The Company examines the evidence related to the recent history of losses, the economic conditions in which the Company \noperates and forecasts and projections to make that determination.  \nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain \nthe position following an audit.  For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has \na greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.  Increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits could \nresult from management\u2019s belief that a position can or cannot be sustained upon examination based on subsequent information or potential lapse of the applicable statute of \nlimitation for certain tax positions.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  For fiscal 2023 and 2022 the Company had no uncertain \ntax provisions and therefore no material provisions for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nResearch, Development and Related Engineering Costs\nResearch, development and related engineering costs are expensed as incurred.\n52\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What criteria does the Company use to determine whether a lease arrangement should be recognized on the balance sheet, and how does it handle leases with an original term of one year or less?", "response": "", "images": []}

{"query": "Context:\n\n11\nManufacturing\nDril-Quip has manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Aberdeen, Scotland; Singapore; Macae, Brazil; and Edmonton, Canada.\nSee \u201cItem 2. Properties\u2014Manufacturing Facilities.\u201d Dril-Quip maintains its high standards of product quality through the use of quality\ncontrol specialists and implementation of continuous improvement methodologies. These continuous improvement methodologies\nleverage Lean practices and focus on improving processes with the goal of providing world-class quality, delivery and service to our\ncustomers at the highest possible value.\nThe Company\u2019s Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore, and Macae manufacturing plants are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 9001\ncertified. The Edmonton manufacturing plant is ISO 9001 certified. The Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore, and Macae plants are also\nlicensed to applicable American Petroleum Institute (API) product specifications and are API Q1, 9th edition and API Q2 compliant.\nThe Edmonton plant is licensed to API 6A product specifications and is API Q1 compliant. Dril-Quip works to maintain its high\nstandards of product quality through the use of precision measuring equipment such as MRP gages, Faro Arms, Coordinate Measuring\nMachine and the application of Lean practices. The Company has the capability to manufacture its products globally and continues to\nhave local capability in key critical markets. The Company\u2019s primary raw material is forged steel products which it procures from\nqualified forging suppliers located globally as well as domestically.\nDril-Quip\u2019s manufacturing facilities utilize state-of-the-art computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools and equipment,\nwhich contribute to the Company\u2019s product quality and timely delivery. The Company has made significant investments for a complete\nupgrade of its manufacturing of subsea wellheads with the latest equipment and technology.\nCustomers\nThe Company\u2019s principal customers are major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies. Drilling\ncontractors and engineering and construction companies also represent a portion of the Company\u2019s customer base. The Company\u2019s\ncustomers are generally oil and gas companies that are well-known participants in exploration and production.\nThe Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers. In 2023, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented\napproximately 59% of total revenues, and Chevron Corporation and its affiliated companies (\u201cChevron\u201d) accounted for approximately\n11% of total revenues. In 2022, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented approximately 60% of total revenues, and Chevron\naccounted for approximately 10% of total revenues. In 2021, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented approximately 59% of total\nrevenue, and Chevron accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total\nrevenues in 2023, 2022 or 2021. The number and variety of the Company\u2019s products required in a given year by any one customer\ndepends upon the amount of that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget devoted to exploration and production, the availability of rigs\nand floating production storage and offloading (FSPO) units, and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a\ncustomer that accounts for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in\nsubsequent years. While the Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of its\nsignificant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nBacklog\nBacklog consists of firm customer orders of Dril-Quip products for which a purchase order, signed contract or letter of award has\nbeen received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled. The Company\u2019s backlog primarily consists\nof our Subsea products. Historically, the Company\u2019s revenues for a specific period have not been directly related to its backlog as stated\nat a particular point in time. The Company\u2019s product backlog was approximately $262.8 million and $240.9 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The backlog at the end of 2023 represents an increase of approximately $21.9 million, or 9.1%, from the\nend of 2022. The Company\u2019s backlog balance was positively impacted during 2023 as our product bookings increased primarily due to\nimprovement in market conditions, the addition of Great North bookings, and a decrease in cancelations compared to 2022.\nThe Company expects to fill approximately 70% to 80% of the December 31, 2023 product backlog by December 31, 2024. The\nremaining backlog at December 31, 2023 consists of longer-term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer\nspecifications requiring longer lead times.\nSee \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain\nindicator of our future revenues and earnings.\u201d\nMarketing and Sales\nDril-Quip has a multifaceted approach to marketing and sales to effectively promote its products and services globally. Utilizing\ndigital marketing channels and its direct sales personnel across diverse domestic and international locations, the Company strives for\ndirect and personalized engagement with clients.\nIn certain foreign markets the Company utilizes independent sales agents or representatives to enhance its marketing and sales\nefforts. Some of the locations in which Dril-Quip has sales agents or representatives are Trinidad, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kuwait, Vietnam,\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Although they do not have authority to contractually bind the Company, these\nrepresentatives market the Company\u2019s products in their respective territories in return for sales commissions.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does Dril-Quip's approach to manufacturing and marketing contribute to its ability to meet the evolving demands of the oil and gas industry, particularly in challenging environments?", "response": "", "images": []}

The principal elements of our\norigination, installation, monitoring and servicing processes are described below:\n\u2022\nCustomer Origination and Consultation.

We believe the quality and\nscope of our expanding sustainable home product offerings, whether to customers that obtained their solar energy system or\nenergy storage system through us or through a third party, is a key differentiator between us and our competitors.\nWe also enter into leases with third-party owners of pools of solar energy systems to receive such third party's interest in\nthose systems. In connection therewith, we assume the related customer PPA and lease obligations, entitling us to future\ncustomer cash flows as well as certain credits, rebates and incentives (including solar renewable energy certificates (\"SRECs\"))\nunder those agreements, in exchange for a lease payment, whether upfront or over time, to the third-party owner, which may be\nmade in the form of cash or shares of our common stock. We believe such arrangements enhance our long-term contracted cash\nflows and are complementary to our overall business model.\nWe commenced operations in January 2013 and began providing solar energy services under our first solar energy system\nin April 2013. Since then, our brand, innovation and focused execution have driven significant, rapid growth in our market\nshare and in the number of customers on our platform.

We believe such arrangements enhance our long-term contracted cash flows and are complementary to our\noverall business model.\nWe commenced operations in January 2013 and began providing solar energy services under our first solar energy system\nin April 2013.

If impairment exists and the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the\nsecurity before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the Company will write down the amortized cost basis to its fair value at the reporting date, recognizing the difference as a loss\nwithin other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. If the Company does not intend to sell the security nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be\nrequired to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the Company will determine if any portion of the unrealized loss on the security is due to credit loss. If the\nimpairment is entirely or partially due to credit loss, the Company will measure the credit loss up to the amount of the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and\nrecognize an allowance for credit losses along with the related charge against earnings as a loss within other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The\nremaining impairment amount due to all other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.

When PP&E is retired or otherwise disposed, the net carrying amount is eliminated \nwith any gain or loss on disposition recognized in earnings at that time.\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets described below (in years).  The \nCompany periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its PP&E and, where appropriate, changes are made prospectively. \n                       \n  \nLand improvements\n25\nBuildings and building improvements\n25 \u2013 40\nMachinery and equipment\n3\u2013 18\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of \naccounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned \nto the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is carried at cost and reviewed for impairment \nannually in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired.  Goodwill is \nallocated to the reporting units at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair values of the reporting units.  In \nassessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of \nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than \nits carrying amount.  Further quantitative assessment may then be required.   The quantitative assessment involves a number of \nassumptions and judgments, including the calculation of fair value for the Company\u2019s identified reporting units.   The Company \ndetermines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on an average of the estimated fair values using an income and \na market approach. The income approach utilizes significant assumptions, including revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (a non-\nGAAP item defined by the Company as net customer sales, less cost of products sold excluding depreciation and amortization, \nless selling and administrative expenses) margin growth rates, discount rates and terminal year exit multiples. If the carrying \nvalue of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying value of the \nreporting unit to its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.   \nFinite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.  Finite-lived intangibles are amortized on a \nstraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives described below (in years).  \nCustomer relationships\n10 - 18\nTrade names\n8 - 27\nTechnology\n6 - 8\nLong-term supply contracts\n15\nPatents\n8\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of \nlong-lived assets, primarily PP&E and finite-lived intangible assets, may be impaired, the Company performs a recoverability \nevaluation.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash \nflows, an impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value, based on discounted cash \nflows. Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are presented in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying value or fair \nvalue less cost to sell.\nLeases.  The Company has operating and finance leases for land and buildings related to certain manufacturing facilities, \nwarehouses and corporate offices, vehicle fleets and certain office and manufacturing equipment. Leases with an initial term of \n12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.  The Company's lease terms include options to extend the lease when it \nis reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option.  Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at \ncommencement of the lease, such as increases in index rates, are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities and \ncorresponding right-of-use assets and are recognized in the period those payments are incurred.  The Company separates lease \nand non-lease components of lease arrangements and allocates contract consideration based on standalone selling prices.  \nVariable consideration is allocated to the lease and non-lease components to which the variable payments specifically relate.   \nThe discount rate implicit within the Company's leases is often not determinable and therefore the Company generally uses its \nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the lease in determining the \npresent value of the lease payments.  The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on lease term and the currency in \nwhich lease payments are made.  The Company's leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material \nrestrictive covenants.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n54\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What is the maximum estimated useful life for machinery and equipment according to the depreciation schedule provided, and how does this compare to the minimum estimated useful life for buildings and building improvements?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/8e65d9112c8cc12d5abb79c8178f0ae7.png", "data/qwen_images/f1f25ccaacd6879c0b97528edd312baf.png"]}

In \nJuly 2022, the Company reached a settlement with the Commission relating to the Commission\u2019s investigation, pursuant to \nwhich the Company agreed to pay a fine in the amount of $8. Fining decisions based on settlements can be appealed under EU \nlaw. The Company is seeking annulment of the Commission\u2019s fining decision on the basis that the referral of the case from the \nFCO to the Commission was unjustified. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of such appeal.\nIn March 2017, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) at the Port of Milwaukee issued a penalty notification alleging \nthat certain of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries intentionally misclassified the importation of certain goods into the U.S. during the \nperiod 2004 -2009.  CBP initially assessed a penalty of $18.  The Company has acknowledged to CBP that the goods were \nmisclassified and has paid all related duties, which CBP does not dispute.  The Company has asserted that the misclassification \nwas unintentional and disputes the penalty assessment by CBP. CBP has brought suit in the U.S. Court of International Trade \nseeking enforcement of the initial penalty against the Company.  At the present time, based on the information available, the \nCompany does not believe that a loss for the alleged intentional misclassification is probable.  However, there can be no \nassurance that the Company will be successful in contesting the assessed penalty.\nOn October 7, 2021, the French Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence (the French Competition Authority or \u201cFCA\u201d) issued a statement of \nobjections to 14 trade associations, one public entity and 101 legal entities from 28 corporate groups, including the Company, \ncertain of its subsidiaries, other leading metal can manufacturers, certain can fillers and certain retailers in France. The FCA \nalleged violations of Articles 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and L.420-1 of the French \nCommercial Code.   The statement of objections alleges, among other things, anti-competitive behavior in connection with the \nremoval of bisphenol-A from metal packaging in France.  The removal of bisphenol-A was mandated by French legislation that \nwent into effect in 2015. On December 29, 2023, the FCA issued a decision imposing a fine of \u20ac4 million on the Company. The \nCompany intends to appeal the decision of the FCA and there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of such appeal. \nThe Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to various other lawsuits and claims with respect to labor, environmental, \nsecurities, vendor and other matters arising out of the Company\u2019s normal course of business. While the impact on future \nfinancial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists, management believes that the \nultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the Company\u2019s consolidated earnings, \nfinancial position or cash flow.  The Company has various commitments to purchase materials, supplies and utilities as part of \nthe ordinary conduct of business.  At times, the Company guarantees the obligations of subsidiaries under certain of these \ncontracts and is liable for such arrangements only if the subsidiary fails to perform its obligations under the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s basic raw materials for its products are aluminum and steel, both of which are purchased from multiple \nsources. The Company is subject to fluctuations in the cost of these raw materials and has periodically adjusted its selling prices \nto reflect these movements.

The Company also has commitments for standby letters of credit and \nfor purchases of capital assets.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company was party to certain indemnification agreements covering environmental remediation, \nlease payments and other potential costs associated with properties sold or businesses divested.

{"query": "Context:\n\nRevenue that is recognized over time for the Company\u2019s three-piece products and equipment business is generally recognized \nusing the cost-to-cost input method as these products involve an intermediary step that results in customized work-in-process \ninventory.  For products that follow a point in time model, revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfer.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or \nproviding services.  Standalone selling prices for each performance obligation are generally stated in the contract.  When the \nCompany offers variable consideration in the form of volume rebates to customers, it estimates the most likely amount of \nrevenue to which it is expected to be entitled and includes the estimate in the transaction price, limited to the amount which is \nprobable will not result in reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the variable consideration is resolved.  When the \nCompany offers customers options to purchase additional product at discounted prices, judgment is required to determine if the \ndiscounted prices represent material rights.  If so, the transaction price allocated to the discount is based on its relative \nstandalone price and is recognized upon purchase of the additional product.  Customer payment terms are typically less than \none year and as such, the Company has applied the practical expedient to exclude consideration of significant financing \ncomponents from the determination of transaction price.\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.  Shipping and handling \nfees and costs from product sales are reported as cost of products sold and are accrued when the Company recognizes revenue \nover time before the shipping and handling activities occur.  Costs to obtain a contract are generally immaterial but the \nCompany has elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred if the duration of the contract is one year or less.\nUnbilled receivables are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control has passed \nto the customer but the customer has not yet been invoiced because the Company does not have present right to payment.  The \nCompany generally has a present right to payment when title of product transfers.  Unbilled receivables are included in \nreceivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding decrease to inventory.\nContract assets are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control for a \nperformance obligation has passed to the customer, but the right to invoice the customer is contingent upon the completion of \nthe performance obligations included in the contract.  Contract assets are classified as current as they are expected to be \ninvoiced within one year and may not exceed their net realizable value.  \nContract liabilities are established if the Company must defer the recognition of a portion of consideration received because it \nhas to satisfy a future obligation.  Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on when the Company \nexpects to recognize revenue.\nStock-Based Compensation. For awards with a service or market condition, compensation expense is recognized over the \nvesting period on a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are \nexpected to vest.  For awards with a performance condition, the Company assesses the probability of vesting at each reporting \nperiod and adjusts compensation cost based on its probability assessment.  The Company\u2019s plans provide for stock awards \nwhich may include accelerated vesting upon retirement, disability, or death of eligible employees. The Company considers a \nstock-based award to be vested when the service period is no longer contingent on the employee providing future service. \nAccordingly, the related compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals, or \nover the period from the grant date to the date that retirement eligibility is achieved if less than the stated vesting period.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with maturities of three \nmonths or less from the time of purchase and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short maturity of \nthose instruments. Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit are included in accounts payable.  The Company generally \nclassifies any cash that is legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage as restricted cash.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and \ndo not bear interest. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on past events, including historical experience, current \nconditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of accounts receivable.  \nInventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined under \nthe first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) or average cost method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment (\u201cPP&E\u201d) is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and \nincludes expenditures for new facilities and equipment and those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity \nof existing PP&E.

Other accounting policies such as reinsurance, premium deficiency reserve, current expected credit loss \nallowance (\u201cCECL\u201d), stock-based compensation, and income taxes do not involve significant levels of uncertainty and are \ndisclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBenefits Payable\nBenefits payable includes estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported, including \nexpected development on reported claims, those that have been reported but not yet paid (reported claims in process) and \nother medical care expenses and services payable.\nOur development of the benefits payable estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as \nadditional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. As more complete claims information becomes \navailable, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which \nthe changes are identified. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed \nbenefits payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period healthcare \nclaims is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported healthcare claims in the current period (favorable \ndevelopment). If the revised estimate of prior period healthcare claims is more than the previous estimate, we will increase \nreported healthcare costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Healthcare costs in the years ended December 31, \n2023 and December 31, 2022 included unfavorable healthcare claim development related to prior years of $19.8 million (net \nof reinsurance) and $1.3 million (net of reinsurance), respectively. \nIn developing our benefits payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which \nincurred claims are being estimated. For example, in recent months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying assumed \nmedical cost trends to the PMPM medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, \nsupplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Additional consideration is also given to adjudicate claims that \nmay reopen as a result of provider disputes.\nCompletion Factors \nA completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the \npercentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion \nfactors are the most significant factors we use in developing our benefits payable estimates. For periods prior to the two most \nrecent months, completion factors include judgments related to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to \nclaim receipt, claim levels, and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers \n(which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our \nclaim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted. For the most \nrecent two months, the completion factors are informed primarily from forecasted per member per month claims projections \ndeveloped from our historical experience and adjusted by emerging experience data in the preceding months which may \ninclude adjustments for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting \nchanges, changes in benefit levels, changes in member cost sharing, changes in medical management processes, product mix, \nand workday seasonality. \n69\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential impacts on financial results if the completion factors used in estimating benefits payable are inaccurately assessed, and how might this affect the company's reported healthcare costs?", "response": "", "images": []}

As a consequence, the prices we \nreceive for crude oil and our heavier liquid products move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it \nreacts to supply and demand factors. \nThe prices of our lighter liquid products move up and down independently of \nany relationship between the crude oil and natural gas markets. \nTransportation costs related to moving crude oil and \nliquids are also generally deducted from the price received for crude oil and liquids.\nOur natural gas is sold under both long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas \nproduced by us is sold at various delivery points to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated \nmidstream companies. \nThe prices we receive are calculated based on various pipeline indices. When there is an \nopportunity to do so, we may have our natural gas processed at San Mateo\u2019s, Pronto\u2019s or third parties\u2019 processing \nfacilities to extract liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas. We are then paid for the extracted NGLs based on \neither a negotiated percentage of the proceeds that are generated from the sale of NGLs or other negotiated pricing \narrangements using then-current market pricing less fixed rate processing, transportation and fractionation fees.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production fluctuate widely. Factors that, directly or \nindirectly, cause price fluctuations include, but are not limited to: the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand \nfor, oil, natural gas and NGLs; the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and certain \nother oil-exporting countries (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) and state-controlled oil companies; the prices and availability of competitors\u2019 \nsupplies of oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; the impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates; \ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts; \nthe availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing and transportation systems for oil, natural gas  \nand NGLs and gathering and disposal systems for produced water; the availability of refining capacity; the prices and \navailability of alternative fuel sources; weather conditions and natural disasters, including hurricanes and tropical \nstorms in the Gulf Coast region and severe cold weather in the Delaware Basin; political conditions or conflicts in or \naffecting oil and natural gas producing regions or countries, including the United States, the Middle East, South \nAmerica, Russia, Ukraine and China; the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Considering the factors outlined in Matador Resources Company's 2023 Annual Report that contribute to oil and natural gas price fluctuations, analyze how a hypothetical scenario involving a simultaneous surge in global demand for energy and a major geopolitical event disrupting a significant portion of global oil production would likely impact the company's profitability and overall financial strategy.", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/a223c72313d766c4237e9958c0967b4a.png"]}

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nIn performing our annual goodwill assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022 of our two reportable segments \u2013 Commercial \nBanking and Civic, we conducted a qualitative assessment of our Commercial Banking reporting unit and a quantitative \nassessment of our Civic reporting unit. In performing the qualitative assessment, we considered relevant events and \ncircumstances that may affect the fair value or carrying amount of the Commercial Banking reporting unit. The events and \ncircumstances we considered included current macroeconomic conditions, current industry conditions and the financial \nperformance of the reporting unit and we concluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that goodwill is impaired at the \nCommercial Banking reporting unit level. Furthermore, in connection with our plans to restructure the Civic reporting unit, we \nelected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to a quantitative test. We measured the fair value of the \nCivic reporting unit consistent with the fair value measurement principle that it is the price that would be received to sell an \nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As a result of \nthe quantitative assessment, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $29.0 million at the Civic reporting unit in the fourth quarter \nof 2022 as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value. This was a non-cash charge to earnings \nand had no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, cash flows, or liquidity position.\nThe unprecedented decline in economic conditions in the banking industry triggered by the failure of two large regional \nbanks caused a significant decline in stock market valuations in March 2023, including our stock price. These triggering events \nindicated that goodwill related to our single reporting unit may be impaired and resulted in us performing a goodwill \nimpairment assessment in the first quarter of 2023. We applied the market approach using an average share price of the \nCompany's stock and a control premium to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The control premium was based upon \nmanagement's judgment using historical information of control premiums for completed bank acquisitions. As a result, we \nrecorded a goodwill impairment of $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as the estimated fair value of equity was less than \nbook value. This was a non-cash charge to earnings and had no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, cash flows or liquidity \nposition.  \nIn performing our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023 we considered relevant events and \ncircumstances that may affect the fair value or carrying amount of our reporting unit. The events and circumstances we \nconsidered included macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, and our financial performance. Based on our qualitative \nassessment, we concluded that there were no conditions, changes in operations, or results that indicated a triggering event had \noccurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thus, a quantitative assessment was not required and we determined that it was more \nlikely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than its carrying value and there was no evidence of \nimpairment.\nBANC OF CALIFORNIA, INC.

Importantly, regulatory capital \nrequirements could increase from current levels, which could require us to raise additional capital or reduce our operations.\nOur ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of \nother factors, including investor perceptions regarding the financial services and banking industry, market conditions and \ngovernmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional \ncapital if needed or on acceptable terms. If we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our liquidity, business, \nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. \nOur holding company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its income and as the primary source of \nfunds for cash dividends to our preferred, common, and NVCE stockholders. \nThe Company is the parent company of, and a separate and distinct legal entity from, the Bank. Legal entity liquidity is an \nimportant consideration as there are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from \none legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, which could result in adverse liquidity events at either the \nCompany and/or the Bank. In particular, the Bank is subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize federal bank \nregulators to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Applicable \nlaws and regulations, including capital and liquidity requirements, could restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or distribute \ncapital to the Company, which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance as to the level of dividends we may pay on our common stock and NVCE stock.\nHolders of our common stock and NVCE stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors \ndeclares out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our \ncommon stock, we are not required to do so and there may be circumstances under which we would reduce, suspend, or \neliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is affected by the policies and enforcement powers of the FRB \nand any future payment of dividends will depend on the Bank\u2019s ability to make distributions and payments to the Company as \nour principal source of funds to pay such dividends. The Bank is also subject to various legal, regulatory and other restrictions \non its ability to make distributions and payments to the Company. There are numerous laws and banking regulations that restrict \nthe Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or make capital distributions to the Company. These statutes and regulations require, among \nother things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, our banking authorities have the \nability to restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends through supervisory action. In addition, in the future, we may enter into \nborrowing or other contractual arrangements that restrict its ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these various \nlimitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make the payment of dividends on our common stock and NVCE stock. See \nalso \"Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Banc of California, Inc.- Repurchases/Redemptions; Dividends\" and \n\"Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - The Bank - Dividends,\" each included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and our business, operations, and income may be adversely affected by \nchanges in laws, rules, and regulations governing our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and legal requirements that affect virtually all aspects of our business \nand operations. The regulatory agencies governing banking organizations are focused on protecting customers, depositors, the \nDeposit Insurance Fund, and the overall financial stability of the United States\u2014not our stockholders or creditors.

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nActions with Purpose \nDriven by purpose, Zoetis partners with \nour colleagues, communities and the \npeople who care for animals to make a \npositive impact on both the health of \nanimals and humanity. \nToday\u2019s veterinary professionals face \nsignificant challenges such as student \nloan debt, mental health challenges, \nand lack of diversity in their fields. To \nhelp address these issues, as well as \nchallenges facing livestock farmers, Zoetis \nFoundation grants funded 28 initiatives in \n2023 for veterinary and farmer education, \nlivelihood and wellbeing programs, while \nalso supporting humanitarian relief \nand a U.S. matching gifts program. By \nexpanding access to education, mental \nwellness resources, debt relief solutions, \nand supporting diversity and inclusion \nefforts, we can promote livelihoods to \nsustain veterinary practices and farmers in \nour communities. \nThe Zoetis Foundation is also supporting \ncommunities in times of global crisis, \nincluding $100,000 in funding to the \nAmerican Red Cross to help those \nimpacted by the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye \nand Syria, while also matching colleague \ndonations up to $100,000. And when a \nmagnitude 4.6 earthquake devastated \nMorocco, the Zoetis Foundation matched \ncolleague donations to the American Red \nCross up to $50,000. \nContinuing to enhance the lives of pets, \nwhile nurturing the human animal bond, \nwe are partnering with Adopt a Pet (AAP), \nNorth America\u2019s largest online pet \nadoption community. Through a nearly \n$1 million annual investment, our actions \nwill help improve access to care for shelter \npets and provide educational resources for \nthe people that care for them, including \ntheir new adoptive families. As part of this \neffort, we also donate products to the vast \nnetwork of nonprofit shelters and rescues \nin AAP\u2019s network through a bi-annual \ngrant program.\nAs we continue investing in colleague \ndevelopment and engagement, our People \nLeader training equips business leaders \nwith skills to lead through uncertain times, \nsupport colleague mentoring and virtual \ncoaching. And a new mobile application \nlaunched in 2023 ensures that our non-\ndesk colleagues stay connected, engaged, \nand informed.\nZoetis colleagues are committed to \npurpose, customers, and each other \u2013 and \nit shows in our colleague engagement \nscore, which has remained above \n86% for several years. In 2023, Zoetis \nearned recognition in markets around \nthe world including \u201cbest\u201d workplace \nfor innovators, for working parents, for \nLGBTQ+ colleagues, and for multicultural \nwomen. Most recently, Zoetis was named \na recipient of the 2024 Catalyst Award for \nadvancing equity for women and other \nunderrepresented groups across the \ncompany.\n5. Advance Sustainability in \nAnimal Health for a Better \nFuture \nWe aim to be a trusted partner for a more \nsustainable future, and our sustainability \nstrategy was developed with the \nconviction that healthier animals build a \nhealthier future for all. In 2023, the Zoetis \nFoundation distributed $8.3 million in \ngrants to support programs that advance \nopportunities for veterinarians and farmers \naround the world (see sidebar). \nWith our history of addressing zoonotic \ndiseases and protecting endangered \nspecies, Zoetis partnered with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Fish \n& Wildlife Service in 2023 to provide \nvaccines against highly pathogenic avian \ninfluenza to help preserve endangered \nCalifornia Condors.\nCaring for animals means caring for \nthe planet we share, and Zoetis\u2019 Global \nManufacturing and Supply team is taking \naction to replace plastic packaging with \npaperboard, starting with our rabies \nvaccine packaging. \nOur actions to advance sustainability \nearned us notable recognitions in 2023 \nincluding Newsweek\u2019s list of Most \nResponsible Companies; ESG Investing\u2019s \nBest Company for ESG & Sustainability in \nthe health care category; DiversityInc\u2019s \nlist of Noteworthy Companies and Best \nCompanies for Board of Directors, \namong others.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the image of American Red Cross volunteers contribute to the overall message of Zoetis's commitment to sustainability and a better future?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/540840f79d66eb024706b040407c1eea.png"]}

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nActions with Purpose \nDriven by purpose, Zoetis partners with \nour colleagues, communities and the \npeople who care for animals to make a \npositive impact on both the health of \nanimals and humanity. \nToday\u2019s veterinary professionals face \nsignificant challenges such as student \nloan debt, mental health challenges, \nand lack of diversity in their fields. To \nhelp address these issues, as well as \nchallenges facing livestock farmers, Zoetis \nFoundation grants funded 28 initiatives in \n2023 for veterinary and farmer education, \nlivelihood and wellbeing programs, while \nalso supporting humanitarian relief \nand a U.S. matching gifts program. By \nexpanding access to education, mental \nwellness resources, debt relief solutions, \nand supporting diversity and inclusion \nefforts, we can promote livelihoods to \nsustain veterinary practices and farmers in \nour communities. \nThe Zoetis Foundation is also supporting \ncommunities in times of global crisis, \nincluding $100,000 in funding to the \nAmerican Red Cross to help those \nimpacted by the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye \nand Syria, while also matching colleague \ndonations up to $100,000. And when a \nmagnitude 4.6 earthquake devastated \nMorocco, the Zoetis Foundation matched \ncolleague donations to the American Red \nCross up to $50,000. \nContinuing to enhance the lives of pets, \nwhile nurturing the human animal bond, \nwe are partnering with Adopt a Pet (AAP), \nNorth America\u2019s largest online pet \nadoption community. Through a nearly \n$1 million annual investment, our actions \nwill help improve access to care for shelter \npets and provide educational resources for \nthe people that care for them, including \ntheir new adoptive families. As part of this \neffort, we also donate products to the vast \nnetwork of nonprofit shelters and rescues \nin AAP\u2019s network through a bi-annual \ngrant program.\nAs we continue investing in colleague \ndevelopment and engagement, our People \nLeader training equips business leaders \nwith skills to lead through uncertain times, \nsupport colleague mentoring and virtual \ncoaching. And a new mobile application \nlaunched in 2023 ensures that our non-\ndesk colleagues stay connected, engaged, \nand informed.\nZoetis colleagues are committed to \npurpose, customers, and each other \u2013 and \nit shows in our colleague engagement \nscore, which has remained above \n86% for several years. In 2023, Zoetis \nearned recognition in markets around \nthe world including \u201cbest\u201d workplace \nfor innovators, for working parents, for \nLGBTQ+ colleagues, and for multicultural \nwomen.

Over the last several years, we have built technical and process competencies at the Masonite Innovation Center, our\nresearch and development center in West Chicago, IL, which we believe is the largest facility of its kind in the industry. Our end-user experience, research and\ndevelopment and engineering capabilities enable us to organically curate innovative ideas, methodically validate commercial and technical viability, and use\ncross-functional teams to launch new product concepts and manufacturing processes. The result of this rigorous approach enables us to launch new, proprietary\nsolutions, enhance the manufacturing efficiency and quality of our products and reduce operational costs.\nIntellectual Property\nWe protect the intellectual property that we develop through, among other things, filing for patents in the United States and various foreign countries.\nIn the United States, we currently have 324 design patents and design patent applications and 249 utility patents and patent applications. We currently have 307\nforeign design patents and patent applications and 229 foreign utility patents and patent applications. Our United States utility patents are generally applicable\nfor 20 years from the earliest filing date, our United States design patents for 15 years and our United States registered trademarks and tradenames are\ngenerally applicable for 10 years and are renewable. Our foreign patents and trademarks have terms as set by the particular country, although trademarks\ngenerally are renewable.\nRaw Materials\nWhile Masonite is vertically integrated, we require a regular supply of raw materials, such as wood chips, some cut stock components, various\ncomposites, steel, glass, aluminum, paint, stain and primer as well as petroleum-based products such as binders, resins and plastic injection frames to\nmanufacture and assemble our products. In 2023, our materials cost accounted for approximately 49% of the total cost of the finished product, from which\nmore than half of the material supply comes from the United States. Wood chips, logs, resins, binders and other additives utilized in manufacturing interior\nmolded facings, exterior fiberglass door facings and door cores are purchased from global, regional and local suppliers, considering the relative freight cost of\nthese materials. Internal framing components, MDF, cut stock and internal door cores are manufactured internally at our facilities and supplemented by\nsuppliers worldwide. We utilize a network of suppliers based in North America, Europe, South America and Asia to purchase other components, including\nMDF, plywood and hardboard facings, door jambs and frames, glass frames and inserts, and steel coils for the stamping of steel door facings.\nManufacturing Process\nAs a vertically integrated door manufacturer, we exercise control over every stage of the production process, from initial design and development to\nthe assembly of finished products. Our components plants supply high-quality door facings, door frames and hardware components such as rails, cores and sills\nto our manufacturing operations. The interior door assembly facilities combine the components to produce a standard hollow or Masonite solid core door. The\nexterior door facilities assemble steel or fiberglass doors by injecting insulating foam into the facings produced by the component plants. At our door\nfabrication facilities, final attributes such as painting and framing are added to the door before packaging the doors for delivery.\nOur commitment to operational excellence is deeply embedded in our manufacturing process, designed to ensure a reliable supply of high-quality\nproducts and exceptional service.

Such litigation may be distracting to management and may require us to\nincur additional, significant costs. Such litigation could result in the Acquisition being delayed and/or enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which\ncould prevent the Acquisition from becoming effective.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Market Factors\nWe are exposed to global political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business that could adversely affect our results of\noperations.\nWe have operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and, to a lesser extent, other foreign jurisdictions. In fiscal 2023, approximately 79% of our\nnet sales were derived from the United States, 10% from Canada and 8% from the United Kingdom. Managing a global business is complex and subjects the\nCompany to certain risks inherent with doing business internationally that could disrupt our operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and collecting receivables;\n\u2022\ntranslations into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes of the assets and liabilities of our non-U.S. operations conducted in local currencies;\n\u2022\ntax rates in foreign countries and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental trade policies, customs, tariffs, import or export and other trade compliance regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of geopolitical events, such as the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe or political uncertainty related to the upcoming\nU.S. presidential election;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions affecting countries where we operate.\nVolatility and uncertainty in general business, economic conditions or financial markets could adversely impact our business, financial performance, results of\noperations and cash flow.\nOur business has been sensitive to, and our financial performance is substantially dependent on, the general business and economic conditions in the\nregions and primary end markets in which we operate. The overall demand for our products could decline as a result of a large number of factors outside of our\ncontrol, including an economic recession, inflation, deflation, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, availability and cost of capital, supply\nchain constraints, consumer spending rates, energy and labor availability and costs and the effects of governmental fiscal and monetary policies in the regions\nin which we operate. Any prolonged economic downturn or volatility in the financial markets that is detrimental to the primary end markets in which we\noperate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial performance, results of operations and cash flow.\nVolatility of the financial and credit markets and its impact to the construction and building product industries and housing markets, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial performance, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe current macroeconomic conditions of heightened inflation and interest rates have challenged our primary end markets (residential new\nconstruction, home repair, renovation and remodeling and non-residential building construction). Challenging economic conditions, either upward or\ndownward, have historically had a direct correlation to the demand for our products and directly impacts our business, financial performance, results of\noperations and cash flow. Accordingly, the following factors have had and may continue to have a direct impact on our business in the countries and regions in\nwhich our products are sold:\n\u2022\nthe amount and type of residential and non-residential construction;\n\u2022\nhousing sales and home values;\n\u2022\nthe age of existing home stock, home vacancy rates and foreclosures;\n\u2022\nnon-residential building occupancy rates;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of raw materials, energy or wages or any shortage in supplies or labor;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of credit;\n\u2022\nemployment rates and consumer confidence; and\n14\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat potential economic factor not explicitly mentioned in the text could significantly impact the company's business in the residential construction market, and how might it affect their operations?", "response": "", "images": []}

We may redeem the 2030 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the applicable redemption prices specified\nunder the indenture governing the 2030 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. If we experience certain changes of control,\nwe must offer to repurchase all of the 2030 Notes at a purchase price of 101.00% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nexcluding, the repurchase date.\nThe indenture governing the 2030 Notes contains limited covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to (i)\nincur certain secured debt, (ii) engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions and (iii) merge or consolidate with other entities. The foregoing limitations are\nsubject to exceptions as set forth in the indenture governing the 2030 Notes.

See the Fair Value Measurements footnote for a description of\nthe fair value guidance. No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period. In the event of a\ntransfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence. Certain pension\nassets valued at net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in\npension plan assets as of August 31, 2023 are described in further detail below.\nShort-term Fixed Income Investments\nShort-term investments consist of money market funds, which are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the relevant fund (Level 1).\nMutual Funds\nMutual funds held by the domestic plans are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d) and seek to either replicate or outperform a related index. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value and to\ntransact at that price. The mutual funds held by the domestic plans are deemed to be actively traded (Level 1).\nCollective Trust\nThe collective trust seeks to outperform the overall small-cap stock market and is comprised primarily of small-cap equity securities with\nquoted prices in active markets for identical investments. The value of this fund is calculated on each business day based on its daily net\nasset value; however, the collective trust is not deemed to be actively traded (Level 2).\nFixed Income Investments\nThe fixed income investment seeks to maximize total return by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade fixed income\nsecurities, primarily publicly traded corporate bonds as well as U.S. government and municipal bonds. The investment is valued on each\nbusiness day based on the values of the underlying holdings and is not actively traded (Level 2).\nU.S. Treasury Investments\nThe domestic plans hold several fixed-income U.S. Treasury securities that are valued based on discounted future cash flows using rates\ncurrently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2)\nReal Estate Fund\nThe real estate fund invests primarily in commercial real estate and includes mortgage loans that are backed by the associated property's\ninvestment objective. The fund seeks real estate returns, risk, and liquidity appropriate to a core fund. The fund also seeks to provide current\nincome with the potential for long-term capital appreciation. This investment is valued based on the NAV per share, without further\nadjustment. The NAV, as provided by the fund's trustee, is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value and is therefore excluded from\nthe fair value\n66\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What changes occurred in the allocation of fixed income securities for both domestic and international plans from 2022 to 2023, and what might be the potential reasons for these changes?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/f7c63f2dbf6c0c28cf152e35cfbeb079.png"]}

Our commitment to sustainability allowed \nus to celebrate 100 Powerful Years in 2023.\nNorthWestern Energy is proud to serve some of \nthe most beautiful areas of the country for over \na century. We know everything we do affects the \nenvironment. Through our environmental programs, \nwe find ways to protect and enhance rivers, streams \nand habitats.\nAs the owner and operator of 11 hydroelectric \nfacilities in Montana, habitat improvement on rivers \nand streams is a high priority for our protection, \nmitigation and enhancement program (PM&E). To \ndate, nearly $60 million has been spent toward \nfisheries and wildlife projects under the Missouri-\nMadison PM&E Program. We also have an active \navian protection program, which includes building \nnesting platforms for ospreys and making sure \nall new power poles are avian safe to reduce the \nlikelihood of birds being electrocuted.\nIn early 2022, we made a commitment to reach net-\nzero emissions by 2050. Our net zero vision outlines \na plan that will continue to serve our customers with \nreliable, affordable energy, while deploying new, \nclean technology as it becomes available, proven \nand cost-effective.

In 2023, 55 percent \nof our electric generation came from carbon-free \nresources as compared to the national average of \napproximately 40 percent.\nIn recent years, we have focused on reducing \nmethane and carbon emissions from our natural \ngas system. NorthWestern Energy has more than \n10,000 miles of gas transmission and distribution \npipe, as well as gas production, compression \nand underground storage operations. These \ngas systems can be a source of leaks, which we \nmitigate by replacing aging pipe infrastructure and \nimproved leak detection capabilities, resulting in \nbetter\u2011than\u2011industry-average (lower) leaks per mile. \nWe also have no cast iron or bare steel pipe on our \nsystem, which historically have been associated with \nhigher leak rates. \nSUSTAINABILITY\n\uf081 Thompson Falls Dam in northwest Montana  is a 94-megawatt facility.

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\npotential impact of 2023 events on the portfolio. Future realized and unrealized investment results will be driven largely by market \nconditions and these future conditions are not reasonably predictable. We believe that the vast majority of our investments will \ncontinue to perform under their contractual terms. We manage the portfolio for long-term economics and therefore we expect to hold a \nsignificant portion of these assets for the long term. The following discussion addresses the strategies and risks associated with our \nvarious classes of investment assets. Although future declines in investment fair values remain possible due to interest rate movements \nand credit deterioration due to both investment-specific uncertainties and global economic uncertainties as discussed below, we do not \nexpect these losses to have a material unfavorable effect on our financial condition or liquidity.\nDebt Securities\nInvestments in debt securities include publicly traded and privately placed bonds, mortgage and other asset-backed securities and \npreferred stocks redeemable by the investor. These investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value in our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Additional information regarding valuation methodologies, key inputs and controls is included in Note \n13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe following table reflects our portfolio of debt securities by type of issuer:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\nFederal government and agency\n$ \n267 \n$ \n312 \nState and local government\n \n38 \n \n41 \nForeign government\n \n352 \n \n365 \nCorporate\n \n8,833 \n \n8,806 \nMortgage and other asset-backed\n \n365 \n \n348 \nTotal\n$ \n9,855 \n$ \n9,872 \nThe carrying value of our debt securities portfolio was flat during the year ended December 31, 2023 reflecting net sales activity offset \nby a valuation increase due to declining market interest rates. Our portfolio remains in a net unrealized depreciation position due to \ngenerally increasing interest rates over the last several quarters. More detailed information about debt securities by type of issuer, \nmaturity dates and net unrealized position is included in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2023, $8.3 billion, or 84%, of the debt securities in our investment portfolio were investment grade (Baa and \nabove, or equivalent) and the remaining $1.6 billion were below investment grade. The majority of the bonds that are below \ninvestment grade were rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. These quality characteristics have not materially \nchanged since the prior year and remain consistent with our investment strategy. \nDebt securities include private placement assets of $4.0 billion. These investments are generally less marketable than publicly traded \nbonds; however, yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly traded bonds with comparable credit risk. We \nperform a credit analysis of each issuer and require financial and other covenants that allow us to monitor issuers for deteriorating \nfinancial strength and pursue remedial actions, if warranted.\nInvestments in debt securities are diversified by issuer, geography and industry. On an aggregate basis, the debt securities portfolio \ncontinues to perform according to original expectations, which includes a long-term economic investment strategy. Elevated global \ninflation, higher interest rates, continuing supply chain disruptions and potential fallout from the stress in the banking system are the \nprimary risks that many of the issuers in our portfolio are facing. To date, most issuers have been successful in managing the cost \nescalation and product shortages without undue margin pressure. We continue to monitor the economic environment and its effect on \nour portfolio and consider the impact of various factors in determining the allowance for credit losses on debt securities, which is \ndiscussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nAs of December 31, 2023, our $1.5 billion commercial mortgage loan portfolio consisted of approximately 50 fixed-rate loans, \ndiversified by property type, location and borrower. These loans are carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their unpaid \nprincipal balance, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. As a result of increasing market interest rates since the majority of \nthese loans were made, the carrying value exceeds the market value of these loans as of December 31, 2023. See Note 13 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements for further details. Given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate, positive debt \nservice coverage and significant borrower cash invested in the property generally ranging between 30 and 40%, we remain confident \nthat the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as expected under their contract terms.

These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the interpretation of existing \nlaws and rules also may change periodically. Domestic and international governments continue to enact and consider various \nlegislative and regulatory proposals, which could materially impact the health care system. We expect continued legislative and \nregulatory debate of issues related to our businesses. As has become increasingly common with public policy reforms in the health \nservices industry, executive, judicial or legislative intervention could alter, slow or eliminate the impact of any proposal following the \nrelated regulation's promulgation.\nMany aspects of our business are directly regulated by federal and state laws and administrative agencies, such as HHS, CMS, the \nInternal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), the U.S. Departments of Labor (\"DOL\") and Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management \n(\"OPM\"), the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), the SEC, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information \nTechnology (\"ONC\"), state departments of insurance and state boards of pharmacy. Our business practices may also be shaped by \nenforcement actions of federal agencies, such as the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), state agencies, as well as judicial decisions.\nIn addition, aspects of our business are subject to indirect regulation. The self-funded benefit plans sponsored by our U.S. employer \nclients are regulated under federal law. These self-funded clients expect us to ensure that our administration of their plans complies \nwith the regulatory requirements applicable to them.\n18\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential impacts on The Cigna Group's business operations if they fail to comply with the increasing and frequently changing regulations imposed by federal, state, and international legislative bodies?", "response": "", "images": []}

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \nand procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \ndeteriorate. \nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially \nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way \nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical \naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it \nrelates. \nIncome Taxes \nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of \n$23.8 million and recorded noncurrent deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability amounts of $83.3 million and \n$9.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. As disclosed by management, the Company operates \nglobally and the calculation of the Company's provision for income taxes and its deferred tax assets and liabilities \ninvolves the interpretation and application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the \nCompany's global operations. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate is highly dependent  upon the geographic distribution of \nits earnings or losses and the effects of tax laws and regulations in each tax-paying jurisdiction in which the Company \noperates. Significant judgments and estimates are required by management in determining the consolidated provision for \nincome taxes due to the global nature of the Company\u2019s operations. The Company\u2019s provision (benefit) for income taxes \nand deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be \npaid, including the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n \n \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What is the significance of the logo shown in the document, and how does it relate to the credibility and responsibilities of the auditing firm mentioned in the report?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/5cc1348a5864c8ef60de3e69086c40be.png"]}
{"query": "<image>Context:\n\n4 \nPART I \nITEM 1. \nBUSINESS \nGeneral \nKronos Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: KRO) (Kronos), incorporated in Delaware in 1989, is a leading global producer \nand marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments, or TiO2, a base industrial product used in a wide range of \napplications. We, along with our distributors and agents, sell and provide technical services for our products to \napproximately 3,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of our sales in Europe, North America and the Asia \nPacific region. We believe we have developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment \nand service of our products in domestic and international markets. \nTiO2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to \nimpart whiteness, brightness and opacity. TiO2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics \nand paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. TiO2 is widely considered to \nbe superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or \nmask other materials effectively and efficiently. TiO2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use \napplications. \nTiO2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more \nhiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment. In addition, TiO2 has excellent resistance to interaction \nwith other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation. Although there are other white \npigments on the market, we believe there are no effective substitutes for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the \nphysical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner. \nPigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO2 in a \nnumber of end-use markets. However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of \nTiO2 and we believe these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO2. \nTiO2 is considered a \u201cquality-of-life\u201d product. Demand for TiO2 has generally been driven by worldwide gross \ndomestic product and has generally increased with rising standards of living in various regions of the world. According to \nindustry estimates, TiO2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2% since 2000. Per \ncapita consumption of TiO2 in Western Europe and North America far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these \nregions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO2 on a per capita basis for the foreseeable future. We \nbelieve Western Europe and North America currently account for approximately 14% and 15% of global TiO2 \nconsumption, respectively. Markets for TiO2 are generally increasing in China, the Asia Pacific region, South America \nand Eastern Europe and we believe these are significant markets which will continue to grow as economies in these regions \ndevelop and quality-of-life products, including TiO2, experience greater demand. \nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 50% of our common stock was owned by Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) and \napproximately 31% was owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL). Valhi also owns \napproximately 83% of NL Industries\u2019 outstanding common stock. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran Corporation \nheld approximately 91% of Valhi\u2019s outstanding common stock. As discussed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial \nStatements, Lisa K. Simmons and a trust established for the benefit of Ms. Simmons and her late sister and their children \n(the \u201cFamily Trust\u201d) may be deemed to control Contran, and therefore may be deemed to indirectly control the wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Contran, Valhi, NL and us. \nProducts and end-use markets \nIncluding our predecessors, we have produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe, our primary \nmarkets, for over 100 years.

{"query": "Context:\n\n6 \nWe produce high-purity sulfate process anatase TiO2 used to provide opacity, whiteness and brightness in a \nvariety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste. In \npharmaceuticals, our TiO2 is used commonly as a colorant in tablet and capsule coatings as well as in liquid medicines to \nprovide uniformity of color and appearance. KRONOS\u00ae purified anatase grades meet the applicable requirements of the \nCTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States Pharmacopoeia and British \nPharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration). \nOur TiO2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised \napproximately 10% of our net sales in 2023: \n\u2022 \nWe own and operate an ilmenite mine in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited \nterm. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO2 plants. Along with \nsupplying ilmenite ore to our sulfate plants in Europe, we also sell ilmenite ore to third parties, some of whom \nare our competitors. The mine has estimated ilmenite reserves that we expect, based on internal estimates, to \nlast approximately 50 years. \n\u2022 \nWe manufacture and sell iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of the \nsulfate and chloride process TiO2 pigment production. These co-product chemicals are marketed through our \nEcochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and \nmunicipal wastewater as well as in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products. \n\u2022 \nWe manufacture and sell other specialty chemicals, which are side-stream products from the production of \nTiO2. These specialty chemicals are used in applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, \nproduction of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices and natural gas pipe and \nother specialty applications. \nManufacturing, operations and properties \nWe produce TiO2 in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase. Rutile TiO2 is manufactured using both a chloride \nproduction process and a sulfate production process, whereas anatase TiO2 is only produced using a sulfate production \nprocess. Manufacturers of many end-use applications can use either form, especially during periods of tight supply for \nTiO2. The chloride process is the preferred form for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets. Due to \nenvironmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO2 industry sales represented by chloride process \npigments has remained stable relative to sulfate process pigments, and in 2023, chloride process production facilities \nrepresented approximately 43% of industry capacity. The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, \nceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been \nproduced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is \u201cfinished\u201d into products with specific performance characteristics \nfor particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and \nintensive micronizing (milling). \n\u2022 \nChloride process \u2013 The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile \nTiO2. The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is \nrecycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also has lower energy \nrequirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a \nhigher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of \nproperties. The chloride process produces a product with a blueish undertone and is the preferred form to \nproduce TiO2 pigments for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets. \n\u2022 \nSulfate process \u2013 The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO2 from \nilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO2 is precipitated \nand calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing \ntreatments. The sulfate process produces a warmer undertone and is preferred for use in selected paper \nproducts, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, some of \nwhich generate higher profit margins. \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the key differences between the chloride and sulfate processes for TiO2 production, and how do these differences impact their suitability for various end-use applications?", "response": "", "images": []}

Under the Buckshot Purchase Agreement, Enservco has agreed to use its\nreasonable best efforts to obtain from specified stockholders a written consent approving the issuance of the common stock as promptly as reasonably\npracticable after the date of the Buckshot Purchase Agreement. In addition, Enservco will prepare and file an information statement in respect to the\nissuance of Enservco common stock under the Buckshot Purchase Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) in accordance\nwith Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cInformation Statement\u201d) or a proxy statement should Enservco proceed with a stockholder\nmeeting in lieu of a written consent seeking approval.\n\u00a0\nUnder the Buckshot Purchase Agreement, Enservco has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC for the purpose of registering for\nresale the shares issued pursuant to the Buckshot Purchase Agreement. Enservco is required to file such registration statement with the SEC within 60 days\nfollowing the closing date.\n\u00a0\nThe Buckshot Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants by each party. The Buckshot Purchase\nAgreement also contains post-closing indemnification rights for each party for breaches of representations and warranties, covenants, as well as certain\nother matters, subject to certain specified limitations.\n\u00a0\nEach party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Acquisition is conditioned upon certain closing conditions, including without limitation: (i) Buckshot\nTrucking having a trailing twelve (12) month adjusted EBITDA of at least $2,000,000 as of the closing date; (ii) Buckshot Trucking delivering a closing\nworking capital amount of at least $1,230,000 as of the closing date; (iii) the Information Statement having been mailed to Enservco\u2019s stockholders and at\nleast 20 calendar days elapsing from the date of completion of such mailing; (iv) the performance by the other party of its obligations and covenants under\nthe Buckshot Purchase Agreement; (v) the absence of any decree prohibiting consummation of the closing; and (vi) the delivery of certain closing\ndeliverables by the other party.\n\u00a0\nIn connection with the Buckshot Purchase Agreement, Enservco will enter into an employment agreement with Tony Sims, one of the former\nowners, to serve as President of Buckshot Trucking.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the\nconsolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then\nended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\u00a0\nSubstantial Doubt about the Company\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\n\u00a0\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully\ndescribed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a significant working capital deficiency, has recurring losses and needs to\nraise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as\na going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\u00a0\nBasis for Opinion\n\u00a0\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\u00a0\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain\nan understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\u00a0\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\n\u00a0\nCritical Audit Matters\n\u00a0\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\u00a0\nImpairment Assessment over Long-lived Assets - Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\u00a0\nThe Company's long-lived assets were $50.5 million and related accumulated depreciation and amortization was $43.6 million as of December 31, 2023\n($6.9 million,\u00a0  net). As discussed in the Company\u2019s accounting policy in Note 2, long-lived assets (asset groups) with finite lives are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Management evaluated its asset groups taking into consideration the nature of its business and\nqualitative aspects of the Company and using segment undiscounted cashflows for current period operations and a 2024 forecast of segment profits and\ndetermined that through this approach there were no triggering events present as of December 31, 2023.\n\u00a0\nWe identified the Company's impairment assessment over long-lived assets as a critical audit matter. Auditing the Company\u2019s impairment assessment\ninvolved a high degree of subjectivity in determining significant assumptions included in the Company\u2019s undiscounted cash flow model, which include\nmanagement\u2019s estimates related to forecasted future growth rates, gross margin to cover costs, and demand for services.\n\u00a0\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\n\u00a0\nOur audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following, among others:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of the Company\u2019s undiscounted cash flow model used in the qualitative impairment assessment by evaluating\nthe significant assumptions used to develop the projected future cash flows of the asset groups, tested the completeness and accuracy of the\nunderlying data used by the Company, performed a comparison of historical activity to forecasted activity, and considered positive and\nnegative evidence impacting management\u2019s forecasts.\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nWe tested the mechanical accuracy of the amounts and formulas included in the Company\u2019s undiscounted cash flow assessment and agreed\nlong-lived asset balances to the Company\u2019s consolidated general ledger.\n\u00a0\n\u25cf\nWe performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in the future cash flows that could result from changes in the assumptions.\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the critical audit matters identified in the audit of Enservco Corporation's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and how were these matters addressed by the auditors?", "response": "", "images": []}

The Trademark Office of the National Intellectual Property Administration, or Trademark Office, is responsible for the\nregistration and administration of trademarks throughout the PRC and the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board of the State\nAdministration for Industry and Commerce under the State Council is responsible for handling trademark disputes.\nRegistered trademarks in the PRC refer to trademarks that have been approved and registered by the Trademark Office, including\ncommodity trademarks, service trademarks, collective marks and certification marks. A trademark registrant will enjoy an exclusive right to\nuse the trademark, which will be protected by laws and regulations. Any mark in the form of word, graphic, alphabet, number, 3D (three-\ndimension) mark, color combination, and voice or the combination of these elements that can distinguish the commodities of the natural\nperson, legal person or other organizations from those of others can be registered as a trademark. A trademark for which an application is\nfiled for registration must be distinctive to be distinguishable, and may not go against the legitimate rights previously obtained by others. A\ntrademark registrant is entitled to include the words \u201cRegistered Trademark\u201d or a sign indicating that it is registered.\nAny of the following acts will be an infringement upon the right to exclusive use of a registered trademark: (1) using a trademark\nthat is identical to a registered trademark on the same kind of commodities without a license from the registrant of the registered trademark;\n(2) using a trademark that is similar to a registered trademark on the same kind of commodities, or using a trademark that is identical or\nsimilar to the registered trademark on similar goods without a license from the registrant of the registered trademark, if the use is likely to\ncause confusion; (3) selling commodities that infringe upon the right to exclusive use of a registered trademark; (4) counterfeit or\nunauthorized production of the label of another\u2019s registered trademark, or sale of any such label that is counterfeited or produced without\nauthorization; (5) changing a registered trademark and putting the commodities with the changed trademark into the market without the\nconsent of the registrant of the registered trademark; (6) providing, intentionally, facilitation for activities infringing upon others\u2019 exclusive\nright of trademark use, and facilitating others to commit infringement on the exclusive right of trademark use; or (7) causing other damage to\nthe right to exclusive use of a holder of a registered trademark. In the event of infringement of the registered trademark above that leads to\ndisputes, the parties concerned may settle such disputes through negotiations; if no negotiation is prospective or fails, the trademark\nregistrant or any interested party may file a lawsuit before the People\u2019s Court or request the administrative department for industry and\ncommerce for handling.\nRegulations on Patent Law\nPatents in the PRC are mainly protected under the Patent Law of the PRC, or the Patent Law, which was issued by the NPC\nStanding Committee on March 12, 1984 and last amended on October 17, 2020, and such amendment became effective on June 1, 2021, and\nits implementation rules, which were promulgated by the State Council of the PRC on December 21, 1992 and last amended on December\n11, 2023. The Patent Law and its implementation rules provide for three types of patents: \u201cinvention,\u201d \u201cutility model\u201d and \u201cdesign.\u201d\n\u201cInvention\u201d refers to any new technical solution relating to a product, a process or improvement thereof; \u201cutility model\u201d refers to any new\ntechnical solution relating to the shape, structure, or their combination, of a product, which is suitable for practical use; and \u201cdesign\u201d refers\nto any new design of the shape, pattern, color or the combination of any two of them, of a product, that creates an aesthetic feeling and is\nsuitable for industrial application. Invention patents are valid for 20 years, while design patents and utility model patents are valid for 10\nyears, each calculated from the date of application. To be patentable, invention or utility models must meet three criteria: novelty,\ninventiveness and practicability. Except under certain specific circumstances provided by law, any third-party user must obtain consent or a\nproper license from the patent owner to use the patent. Otherwise, the use constitutes an infringement of the patent rights.\nIf a dispute arises due to patent infringement, the dispute must be settled through consultation involving both parties. If one or both\nparties are unwilling to submit to consultation, or if the consultation fails, then the patentee or any interested party may initiate legal\nproceedings in the People\u2019s Court, or request the patent administrative department to handle the matter.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the key differences in the protection and enforcement mechanisms between trademark and patent laws in the PRC, and how do these differences impact the rights and obligations of trademark registrants and patent holders?", "response": "", "images": []}

This may make it more difficult\nfor shareholders to influence the management of our company. Holders of our shares are not subject to this discretionary proxy. In addition,\nin the event that voting on any resolution or matter is conducted on a show of hands basis in accordance with our constituent documents, the\ndepositary will refrain from voting and the voting instructions received by the depositary from holders shall lapse.\nHolders of ADSs may not receive dividends or other distributions on our shares and holders may not receive any value for them, if it is\nillegal or impractical to make them available to them.\nThe depositary of our ADSs has agreed to pay holder of our ADSs the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian\nreceives on shares or other deposited securities underlying our ADSs, after deducting its fees and expenses. Holders of ADSs will receive\nthese distributions in proportion to the number of shares their ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible if it decides that it\nis unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would be unlawful to make a distribution\nto a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities Act but that are not properly registered or\ndistributed under an applicable exemption from registration. The depositary may also determine that it is not feasible to distribute certain\nproperty through the mail. Additionally, the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of mailing them. In these cases, the\ndepositary may determine not to distribute such property. We have no obligation to register under U.S. securities laws any ADSs, ordinary\nshares, rights or other securities received through such distributions. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the\ndistribution of ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of ADSs. This means that holders of ADSs may not receive\ndistributions we make on our ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to holders of\nADSs. These restrictions may cause a material decline in the value of our ADSs.\nThe right of our ADS holders to participate in any future rights offerings may be limited, which may cause dilution to their holdings of\nour ADS.\nWe may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. However, we cannot make\nsuch rights available to holders of ADSs in the United States unless we register both the rights and the securities to which the rights relate\nunder the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements is available. Under the deposit agreement, the depositary will\nnot make rights available to holders of ADSs unless both the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to holders of ADSs are\neither registered under the Securities Act or exempt from registration under the Securities Act. We are under no obligation to file a\nregistration statement with respect to any such rights or securities or to endeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared\neffective and we may not be able to establish a necessary exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of\nADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings in the future and may experience dilution in their holdings.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow might the discretionary proxy provision in the deposit agreement potentially create a conflict of interest between ADS holders and ordinary shareholders, and what specific scenario could illustrate this conflict?", "response": "", "images": []}

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nTable of contents\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe information related to recently issued accounting pronouncements as set forth in Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting\nPronouncements, of the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nAs discussed in Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, of the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and\ndisclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates\nand judgments on factors we believe to be relevant, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other\nsources. The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and, in\nsome cases, actuarial and valuation techniques. We constantly reevaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate. While we believe that the factors\nconsidered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be\naccurate. As the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nWe believe the following represent the most significant accounting policies, critical estimates and assumptions, among others, used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nPolicy\nJudgments and Estimates\nEffect if Actual Results \nDiffer from Assumptions\nInventories- The U.S. Retail segment inventory is accounted for\nusing the retail inventory method, which is stated at the lower of cost\nor market. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of\ninventories at cost and the resulting gross profits are determined by\napplying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of\ninventories. The cost basis of inventories reflected on the balance\nsheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time that the retail\nvalue of the inventory is lowered by markdowns. The Canada Retail\nand Brand Portfolio segments account for inventory using the\nmoving average cost method and is stated at the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value. For all inventories, we also monitor excess and\nobsolete inventories that may need to be liquidated at amounts below\ncost. We perform physical inventory counts or cycle counts on all\ninventory on hand throughout the year and adjust the recorded\nbalance to reflect the results. We record estimated shrink between\nphysical inventory counts, based on historical experience and recent\nresults, less amounts realized.\nInherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant\njudgments and estimates, including setting the original\nmerchandise retail value, markdowns, shrink, and liquidation\nvalues. The shrink reserve is calculated as a percentage of net\nsales from the last physical inventory date, based on both\nhistorical experience and recent physical inventory results, less\namounts realized. Aged inventory may be written down using\nestimated liquidation values and cost of disposal based on\nhistorical experience.\nIf the reduction to inventories for markdowns, shrink, and\naged inventories were to increase by 10%, cost of sales would\nincrease by approximately $4.1 million.\n29\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How might a 15% increase in markdowns, shrink, and aged inventory write-downs impact the company's cost of sales, and what factors should management consider when evaluating the potential ripple effects of such an increase on other aspects of the business?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/427d550a800bea0de11a322a5fcd56db.png"]}

Employment Agreement, Offer Letter or Other Arrangement. To the extent a written employment agreement, offer letter or other arrangement (\u201cEmployment Arrangement\u201d) that was approved by the Committee or the Board of Directors or that was approved in writing by an officer of the Company pursuant to delegated authority of the Committee provides for greater benefits to the Participant with respect to vesting of the Award on termination of employment, than provided in this Agreement or in the Plan, then the terms of such Employment Arrangement with respect to vesting of the Award upon the termination of the Participant\u2019s employment by reason of such specified events shall supersede the terms hereof to the extent permitted by the terms of the Plan. 15. Code Section 409A. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A so as to comply with an exception to Code Section 409A, or to the extent that this Agreement provides deferred compensation, to be in compliance with Code Section 409A. This Agreement is intended to be exempt from Code Section 409A under the \u201cshort term deferral\u201d exception. References to termination of employment, and similar terms shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the definition of \u201cseparation from service\u201d under Code Section 409A, to the extent required by Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Participant is a \u201cspecified employee\u201d for purposes of Code Section 409A, then if necessary to avoid the imposition of additional taxes or interest under Code Section 409A, the Company shall not deliver the corresponding Shares otherwise payable upon the Participant\u2019s termination of employment\nuntil the first business day after the date that is six months after the Participant\u2019s \u201cseparation from service\u201d under Code Section 409A. This Agreement shall be deemed to be modified to the maximum extent necessary to be in compliance with Code Section 409A\u2019s rules. If the Participant is unexpectedly required to include in the Participant\u2019s current year\u2019s income any amount of compensation relating to this Award because of a failure to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, then to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A, the Participant may receive a distribution of cash or Shares in an amount not to exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of the failure to comply with Code Section 409A. In no event may the Participant directly or indirectly designate the calendar year of a payment, except as expressly permitted by Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant recognizes and acknowledges that Code Section 409A may impose certain taxes or interest charges upon the Participant for which the Participant is and shall remain solely responsible. 16. Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement and the Plan are: (a) intended to be the final, complete, and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the Participant and the Company with regard to the subject matter of this Agreement; (b) supersede all other prior agreements, communications and statements, whether written or oral, express or implied, pertaining to that subject matter; and (c) may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous statements or agreements, oral or written, and not be explained or supplemented by evidence of consistent additional terms. 17. No Employment Rights. Nothing in this Agreement will provide the Participant with any right to continue in the Company\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 employ for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restric\nin any way the rights of the Company and its affiliates to terminate the Participant\u2019s service at any time for any reason, with or without cause. 18. Nature of Award. The Participant acknowledges that (a) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty and (b) in consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Restricted Stock Units or diminution in value of the Shares received upon settlement including (without limitation) any claim or entitlement resulting from termination of the Participant\u2019s active employment by the Company or a Subsidiary (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws) and the Participant hereby releases the Company and its Subsidiaries from any such claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then, by accepting the Restricted Stock Units and this Agreement, the Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived his or her entitlement to pursue such claim.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the implications for a Participant if they are classified as a \"specified employee\" under Code Section 409A, and how does this classification affect the timing of share delivery upon termination of employment?", "response": "", "images": []}

In the event of the Participant\u2019s death, payment shall be made to the Participant\u2019s designated beneficiary, or absent such designation, in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. The delivery of the Shares shall be subject to payment of the applicable withholding tax liability and the forfeiture provisions of this Agreement. 5. Dividend Equivalents. To the extent that cash dividends are paid on Shares after the Grant Date and before the date the Participant receives the Shares subject to Restricted Stock Units subject to this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units hereunder will be credited with an additional number of Restricted Stock Units to reflect reinvested dividend equivalents with respect to the period of time between the Grant Date and the delivery of Shares under this Agreement. Such dividend equivalent credits will be equal in value (based on the reported dividend rate on the date dividends were paid) to the amount of dividends paid on the Shares represented by the Restricted Stock Units under this Agreement. The Restricted Stock Units will be credited with whole Restricted Stock Units equal to the dollar amount of the reinvested dividend equivalents based on the Fair Market Value on the dividend payment dates. The Participant shall vest in the additional Restricted Stock Units in accordance with Sections 1 and 3 of this Agreement in the same manner that the Participant vests in the original grant of Restricted Stock Units. These additional Restricted Stock Units will be distributed in whole Shares in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement. If and to the extent the underlying Restricted Stock Units are forfeited, all related Restricted Stock Units added to reflect reinvested dividend equivalents in accordance with this Section 5 shall also be forfeited. 6. Right of Set-Off. By accepting these Restricted Stock Units, the\nParticipant consents to a deduction from, and set-off against, any amounts owed to the Participant by the Company or a Subsidiary from time to time (including, but not limited to, amounts owed to the Participant as wages, severance payments or other fringe benefits) to the extent of the amounts owed to the Company or a Subsidiary by the Participant under this Agreement. 7. No Shareholder Rights. The Participant shall have no rights of a shareholder with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, including, without limitation, voting rights and actual dividend rights with respect to the Shares represented by the Restricted Stock Units. 8. Withholding Tax. (a) Generally. The Participant is liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the Restricted Stock Units regardless of any action the Company takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Restricted Stock Units. The Company does not make any representation or undertaking regarding the tax treatment or the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the subsequent sale of Shares issuable pursuant to the Restricted Stock Units. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant\u2019s tax liability. (b) Payment of Withholding Taxes. Prior to any event in connection with the Restricted Stock Units (e.g., vesting or settlement) that the Company determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any employment tax obligation (the \u201cTax Withholding Obligation\u201d), the Participant is required to arrange for the satisfaction of the amount of such Tax Withholding Obligation in a manner acceptable to the Company. Unless the Participant elects to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by an alternative means that is then permitted by the Company, the\nCompany shall withhold on the Participant\u2019s behalf the number of shares from those Shares issuable to the Participant at the time when the Restricted Stock Units become vested and payable as the Company determines to be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. In the case of any amounts withheld for taxes pursuant to this provision in the form of Shares, the amount withheld shall be determined in accordance with the procedures approved by the Committee. 9. Governing Law/Venue for Dispute Resolution. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent superseded by the laws of the United States of America. The parties agree and acknowledge that the laws of the State of Ohio bear a substantial relationship to the parties and/or this Agreement and that the Restricted\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the agreement address the potential tax implications of dividend equivalents on Restricted Stock Units, particularly in the event of forfeiture?", "response": "", "images": []}

This work speaks to the \nstrength of character of Moody\u2019s employees, which is evident \nin the values they share. \nI want to say a special thanks to Ray McDaniel, the outgoing \nChairman of Moody\u2019s Board of Directors, who retired in \nApril 2023 after a long and distinguished career. The Board \nshares the deep appreciation held by Moody\u2019s employees for \nhis steady leadership and his tremendous contributions \nto the \ufb01rm. \nFinally, I express my appreciation to Moody\u2019s stockholders \nfor their continued support, and I thank the company\u2019s \nexecutive leadership team and all employees for their \ntremendous efforts. \nVincent A. Forlenza  \nChairman of the Board of Directors\nLooking back on 2023, global trends continued to converge \nand shape what proved to be another year of swift and seismic \nchange.

This new role has afforded me a unique vantage point for \nre\ufb02ection on the impressive achievements of Moody\u2019s teams \namidst this backdrop. \nEXPONENTIAL OPPORTUNITY \nFueled by visionary leadership and an unwavering belief that \ngreater transparency, more informed decisions, and fair access \nto information opens the door to shared progress, the \ufb01rm has \nsteadily evolved to meet the moment \u2013 one Moody\u2019s de\ufb01ned \nin 2023 as an era of exponential risk. A more interconnected \nworld has led risks to compound. Consider the interrelated \nimpacts from extreme weather events, cyberattacks and \nsupply chain failures \u2013 collectively, these forces have elevated \nglobal uncertainty.  \nThroughout this dynamic environment, Moody\u2019s remained \nfocused on sustainable value creation for its stakeholders \nby further de\ufb01ning this moment as one also marked by \nexponential opportunity. The momentum behind Moody\u2019s \nachievements is in\ufb02uenced by a clear mindset focused on \ngrowth by helping stakeholders anticipate, adapt, and thrive \nin our new global paradigm.\nINNOVATING FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS\nAs part of its evolution, Moody\u2019s has remained focused on \nproviding innovative solutions and insights across its business \u2013 \nfrom ratings and research to data and analytics.

Refer to Note 16 to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding impairment, restructuring and other charges.\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s store assets in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 was determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash \nflows and discounting them using a risk-adjusted rate of interest.

We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These\nestimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from\ndifferences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax\npositions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide\nfor income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide\nearnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We monitor the changes in many\nfactors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nSignificant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not\nthat all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all\navailable positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are\nrecoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions.\nAlthough the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether\nan uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting\nfor uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of\nwhether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated,\nwhich could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further\ncharge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would\nresult in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAdoption of New Pronouncements\nSee Note\u00a02, \"New Accounting Pronouncements,\" to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.\nRestructuring and Other Related Costs\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we initiated a new restructuring plan (\"FY23 Plan\") designed to reduce costs and expenses in response to the current\nmacroeconomic conditions. The plan includes a reduction of our total headcount by approximately 400 regular employees, representing approximately 2 percent of\nour global workforce, and the consolidation of our excess facilities, including some site closures.\nIn connection with this plan, we have recorded approximately $46 million in restructuring and other related costs in fiscal year 2023. These costs include\nseverance and other personnel costs associated with the workforce reduction. The consolidation of excess facilities includes accelerated depreciation expenses of\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") and machinery and equipment assets and other facilities-related costs. The timing and scope of the workforce reductions will vary based on\nlocal legal requirements. These actions impact all three of our business segments. The costs associated with this restructuring plan have not been allocated to our\nbusiness segments' results; however, each business segment will benefit from the future costs savings from these actions. When completed, the restructuring program\nis expected to result in a reduction of $80 million in annual cost of sales and operating expenses over the three business segments. While the majority of the\nworkforce reduction will be completed in the first quarter of 2024, we expect to substantially complete the remaining restructuring activities by the end of fiscal year\n2024.\n36\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential financial impacts and considerations for a company when implementing a restructuring plan, particularly in terms of workforce reduction and consolidation of facilities, and how might these actions affect the company's financial statements and future operations?", "response": "", "images": []}

This agreement was expanded in 2018 to increase the number of programs from eight to ten and to\nextend BMS\u2019s research period. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted BMS a right to exercise options to worldwide, royalty-bearing, antibody\nsequence pair-specific exclusive licenses to research, develop and commercialize certain licensed products. We received an upfront payment of $8.0 million\nand an expansion fee of $4.0 million. BMS has the right to exercise options on up to ten programs, but in 2023 BMS stopped further development of one of\nthe ten programs. If BMS opts in on a program, we are eligible to receive up to $164.0 million per product candidate (up to $1.64 billion for all ten\nprograms, or $1.48 billion not including the one program for which BMS has stopped development), comprised of a commercial license option payment of\n$7.5 million, development milestone payments of up to $101.5 million and commercial milestone payments of up to $55.0 million. As of December 31,\n2023, BMS has exercised one commercial license option and we have received a total of $7.5 million in product candidate-specific payments. In addition,\nwe are eligible to receive tiered royalties calculated upon the global net sales of the resulting products. BMS will have exclusive worldwide\ncommercialization rights to products derived from the agreement if BMS elects to exercise a commercial license option for each product. After conclusion\nof BMS\u2019s research period, BMS will be solely responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of the products.\nIn June 2020, our existing collaboration agreement with BMS was amended to expand the license grant to include the use of our EFECT platform for the\ndevelopment of therapeutic candidates and to extend the research term. We received an upfront expansion fee of $12.0 million and all other financial terms\nwere unchanged.\nThe agreement contains customary termination rights for BMS and us, including the right of BMS to terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a\nproduct-by-product basis in its sole discretion with advance notice to us. The agreement will terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country\nbasis upon the later of the expiration of the last-expiring patent related to the BMS licensed product, or ten years after the first commercial sale of the BMS\nlicensed product in such a country. If BMS does not exercise its option for the commercial license, the agreement will terminate on a product-by-product\nbasis for which the option was not exercised.\nGSK\nIn December 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with GSK to research, develop and commercialize up to ten Fc-engineered\nmonoclonal and bispecific antibodies generated through the use of our EFECT and Azymetric platforms. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted\nGSK a worldwide, royalty-bearing antibody target-exclusive license to new intellectual property generated to the EFECT platform under this collaboration\nand a non-exclusive license to the Azymetric platform to research, develop and commercialize future licensed products. We are eligible to receive up to\n$1.1 billion, including research, development and commercial milestone payments of up to $110.0 million for each product. In addition, we are eligible to\nreceive tiered royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products. No development or commercial milestone payments or royalties have been received\nas of December 31, 2023. We retained the right to develop up to four products, free of royalties, using the new intellectual property generated in this\ncollaboration, and after a period of time, to grant licenses to such intellectual property for development of additional products by third parties. Under this\nagreement, we are sharing certain research and development responsibilities with GSK to generate new Fc-engineered antibodies.

As of December \n31, 2023, without prior regulatory approval, $205,185 of the Company\u2019s consolidated retained earnings was free from restriction under the insurance \nstatutes and regulations and available for the payment of dividends in 2024. The following briefly describes certain related and other requirements and \nrestrictions imposed by the states or jurisdiction in which the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated.\nFlorida\nHCPCI and TypTap, which are domiciled in Florida, prepare their statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting principles and \npractices prescribed or permitted by the FLOIR, which Florida utilizes for determining solvency under the Florida Insurance Code (the \u201cCode\u201d). The \ncommissioner of the FLOIR has the right to permit other practices that may deviate from prescribed practices. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are \nthose practices that are incorporated directly or by reference in state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance \nenterprises domiciled in Florida. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices that are not prescribed; such practices differ \nfrom state to state, may differ from entity to entity within a state, and may change in the future.\n105\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What was the trend in net income (loss) for HCI Group, Inc. during the quarters of 2022, and how might this have impacted their financial strategy?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/d96e661d4f674e9f5586d289c2dfba9a.png", "data/qwen_images/f6e0cb0f76dddc18a1d1416dc507ef9b.png"]}
{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nHCI GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollar amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)\n\u00a0\nNote 16 -- Variable Interest Entity\nCORE, a Florida-domiciled reciprocal insurance exchange, is owned by its policyholders, referred to as subscribers, who gain ownership by \nbuying an insurance policy and making a surplus contribution. Each subscriber has certain interests in CORE which include the right to appoint an \nattorney-in-fact (\u201cAIF\u201d), to vote for CORE\u2019s advisory committee and to receive dividends or premium credits if CORE generates a surplus. At least two-\nthirds of the membership of CORE\u2019s advisory committee must be subscribers who are independent of the AIF. CORE\u2019s advisory committee is charged with \noverseeing the financial affairs of CORE. \nAt inception, CORE had no subscribers nor sufficient surplus to fund its insurance operations without additional financial support. HCI provided \nCORE with $25,000 in exchange for a 9% subordinated surplus note. As a result, CORE is considered a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d). In addition, CORE \nentered into an AIF agreement with CRM, a wholly owned subsidiary of HCI. The AIF agreement, which was approved by the FLOIR, can be terminated \nat any time by mutual agreement of both parties or with cause, if the FLOIR or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a material breach of the\nagreement has occurred. Under the AIF agreement, CRM, with the power of attorney given by the subscribers, will directly or indirectly conduct the daily \noperations of CORE by underwriting insurance policies, collecting premiums, investing funds, and processing claims. As such, subscribers do not possess \nthe power to directly manage CORE\u2019s operations. The AIF agreement also permits CRM to contract with service providers including other HCI \nsubsidiaries to perform certain functions. The activities which most significantly impact CORE's anticipated economic performance are its underwriting \nand investment results. The management and service agreements, together with HCI\u2019s subordinated surplus note in CORE, exposes HCI to more than an \ninsignificant amount of CORE\u2019s expected economic performance. As such, HCI has variable interests in CORE.\nSince HCI has the power to direct the activities of CORE that most significantly affect CORE\u2019s economic performance and the obligation to \nabsorb losses or the right to receive benefits from CORE that could potentially be significant to CORE via the subordinated surplus note and the \nmanagement and service agreements, HCI is considered the primary beneficiary of CORE, a VIE, and is required to consolidate CORE. Since HCI has no \nequity at risk, CORE\u2019s equity and results of operations are included in noncontrolling interests. In the event of dissolution, subscribers will participate in \nthe distribution of any remaining equity without being liable for any shortfall in CORE's equity. Prior to distributing residual equity to subscribers, CORE's \nremaining assets, after fulfilling all other outstanding obligations, will be allocated to settle the holders of CORE's subordinated debts such as HCI\u2019s 9% \nsubordinated surplus note, comprising unpaid principal and accrued interest.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss relating to CORE was $25,000. CORE\u2019s assets are legally restricted for the \npurpose of fulfilling obligations specific to CORE. The creditors of CORE have no legal right to pursue additional sources of payment from the Company. \nThe following table summarizes the assets related to CORE which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDecember 31,\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\nAssets:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCash and cash equivalent\n\u00a0 $\n24,635\u00a0 \u00a0 $\n\u2014\u00a0\nRestricted cash\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n300\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nOther assets\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n65\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n87\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What is the total value of assets related to CORE as of December 31, 2023, and how does this compare to the previous year?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/28a56f8c6d2df63135e7a8c7f1533b3d.png"]}

For public entities, this update amends the required amortization period for leasehold improvements \nassociated with common control leases to be over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group, regardless of the lease term, \nas long as the lessee controls the use of the asset through a lease. In addition, if the lessor is sub-leasing the asset while simultaneously leasing the asset \nfrom an entity not within the same common control group, the amortization period may not exceed the amortization period of the common control group. \nOnce the lessee no longer controls the use of the asset, the asset will be accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an \nadjustment to equity.

In August 2017, we acquired \na 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture, the entity that owns portions of the Five Point Gateway Campus.\nOur company has an entity structure in which our two largest equity owners, Lennar and Castlelake, and our founder and \nChairman Emeritus, Emile Haddad, separately hold, in addition to interests in our common shares, equity interests in either or both the \noperating company or the San Francisco Venture that can be exchanged for, at our option, either our Class A common shares or cash. \nThe diagram below presents a simplified depiction of our current organizational structure.\n(1)  Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we serve as sole managing general partner of the operating company, and as of December 31, \n2023, we owned approximately 62.6% of the outstanding Class A units of the operating company. We conduct all of our \nbusinesses in or through the operating company, which owns, directly or indirectly, equity interests in, and controls the \nmanagement of FPL, the San Francisco Venture and the management company. Class A units of the operating company that we \ndo not own are held by affiliates of Lennar, Castlelake, and Mr. Haddad and can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis, at our \noption, for either Class A common shares or cash equal to the fair market value of such shares. Until Class A units of the \noperating company are exchanged or redeemed, the capital associated with Class A units of the operating company not held by us \nis presented within \u201cnoncontrolling interests\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet. Based on the closing price of our Class A \ncommon shares on February 29, 2024 ($3.27), our market capitalization on a fully exchanged basis was approximately $485.0 \nmillion.\n(2)  The operating company owns all of the outstanding Class B units of the San Francisco Venture. The Class A units of the San \nFrancisco Venture, which are owned by affiliates of Lennar and Castlelake, are intended to be economically equivalent to Class A \nTable of Contents\n1\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What key strategic advantage does Five Point Holdings, LLC gain from its organizational structure, particularly in relation to its ownership of the operating company and the San Francisco Venture?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/577e887cbb003d8a025df36b95a61317.png"]}

The Operating Company acquired a controlling interest in the San \nFrancisco Venture in the May 2016 Formation Transactions by acquiring all of the outstanding Class B units of the San Francisco \nVenture. All of the outstanding Class A units are owned by Lennar and Castlelake. The Class A units of the San Francisco Venture are \nintended to be substantially economically equivalent to the Class A Common Units of the Operating Company. The Class A units of \nthe San Francisco Venture represent noncontrolling interests to the Operating Company. \nHolders of Class A units of the San Francisco Venture can redeem their units at any time and receive Class A Common Units \nof the Operating Company on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment in the event of share splits, distributions of shares, warrants or \nshare rights, specified extraordinary distributions and similar events). If a holder requests a redemption of Class A units of the San \nFrancisco Venture that would result in the Holding Company\u2019s ownership of the Operating Company falling below 50.1%, the \nHolding Company has the option of satisfying the redemption with Class A common shares instead. The Company also has the option, \nat any time, to acquire outstanding Class A units of the San Francisco Venture in exchange for Class A Common Units of the \nOperating Company. The 12 month holding period for any Class A Common Units of the Operating Company issued in exchange for \nClass A units of the San Francisco Venture is calculated by including the period that such Class A units of the San Francisco Venture \nwere owned. This exchange right is currently exercisable by all holders of outstanding Class A units of the San Francisco Venture.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nIn 2019, the San Francisco Venture issued 25.0 million Class C units to an affiliate of Lennar in exchange for a contribution \nof $25.0 million to the San Francisco Venture. Provided that Lennar completes the construction of a certain number of new homes in \nCandlestick as contemplated under purchase and sale agreements with the Company, the San Francisco Venture is required to redeem \nthe Class C units if and when the Company receives reimbursements from the Mello-Roos community facilities district formed for the \ndevelopment, in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of any reimbursements received up to a maximum amount of $25.0 million. The \nSan Francisco Venture also maintains the ability to redeem the then outstanding balance of Class C units for cash at any time. Upon a \nliquidation of the San Francisco Venture, the holders of Class C Units are entitled to a liquidation preference. The maximum amount \npayable by the San Francisco Venture pursuant to redemptions or liquidation of the Class C units is $25.0 million. The holders of \nClass C units are not entitled to receive any other forms of distributions and are not entitled to any voting rights. In connection with \nthe issuance of the Class C units, the San Francisco Venture agreed to spend $25.0 million on the development of infrastructure and/or \nparking facilities at the Company\u2019s Candlestick development. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, $25.0 million of Class C units were \noutstanding and included in redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets.\n6.\nCONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY \nThe Holding Company conducts all of its operations through the Operating Company, a consolidated VIE, and as a result, \nsubstantially all of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities represent the assets and liabilities of the Operating Company, other than items \nattributed to income taxes and the payable pursuant to tax receivable agreement (\u201cTRA\u201d). The Operating Company has investments in \nand consolidates the assets and liabilities of the San Francisco Venture, FP LP and Five Point Land, LLC (\u201cFPL\u201d), the entity \ndeveloping Valencia, all of which have also been determined to be VIEs. \nThe San Francisco Venture is a VIE as the other members of the venture, individually or as a group, are not able to exercise \nkick-out rights or substantive participating rights. The Company applied the variable interest model and determined that it is the \nprimary beneficiary of the San Francisco Venture and, accordingly, the San Francisco Venture is consolidated in the Company\u2019s \nresults. In making that determination, the Company evaluated that the Operating Company has unilateral and unconditional power to \nmake decisions in regards to the activities that significantly impact the economics of the VIE, which are the development of properties, \nmarketing and sale of properties, acquisition of land and other real estate properties and obtaining land ownership or ground lease for \nthe underlying properties to be developed. The Company is determined to have more-than-insignificant economic benefit from the San \nFrancisco Venture because, excluding Class C units, the Operating Company can prevent or cause the San Francisco Venture from \nmaking distributions on its units, and the Operating Company would receive 99% of any such distributions made (assuming no \ndistributions had been paid on the Class A Common Units of the Operating Company).

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nCommercial Segment \nWe have a 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture that is held through a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating \ncompany, and we serve as the manager of the Gateway Commercial Venture. However, the manager\u2019s authority is limited. Major \ndecisions by the Gateway Commercial Venture generally require unanimous approval by an executive committee composed of two \npeople designated by us and two people designated by another investor. Some decisions require approval by all of the members of the \nGateway Commercial Venture. We do not include the Gateway Commercial Venture as a consolidated subsidiary in our consolidated \nfinancial statements. However, as a result of our 75% economic interest and our role as manager, we assess our investment in the \nGateway Commercial Venture based on the financial information of the Gateway Commercial Venture in its entirety, and we include \nthe Gateway Commercial Venture\u2019s financial results within the Commercial segment. Additionally, the management company has \nbeen engaged by the Gateway Commercial Venture to provide property management services to the Five Point Gateway Campus. We \ninclude the management company\u2019s results of operations related to these property management services within the Commercial \nsegment.\nThe Five Point Gateway Campus is a commercial campus consisting of approximately 73 acres of land in the Great Park \nNeighborhoods acquired by the Gateway Commercial Venture in 2017. The Five Point Gateway Campus currently includes \napproximately one million square feet planned for research and development, medical and office space in four buildings. In 2020, the \nGateway Commercial Venture sold three of the buildings and approximately 11 acres of land at the campus. Our corporate \nheadquarters are located in the fourth building, which remains owned by the Gateway Commercial Venture. In addition to the fourth \nbuilding, the Gateway Commercial Venture owns approximately 50 acres of commercial land with additional development rights at \nthe campus.\nThe table below reconciles the Commercial segment results for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 to the equity in \nloss from our investment in the Gateway Commercial Venture that is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for the \nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nSegment (loss) profit from operations\n$ \n(3,454) $ \n249 \nLess net income of management company attributed to the Commercial segment\n \n431  \n418 \nNet loss of Gateway Commercial Venture\n \n(3,885)  \n(169) \nEquity in loss from Gateway Commercial Venture\n$ \n(2,914) $ \n(127) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nAt December 31, 2023, we had $353.8 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents, compared to $131.8 million at \nDecember 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no funds had been drawn on and no letters of credit were outstanding on the operating \ncompany\u2019s $125.0 million revolving credit facility.\nOur short-term cash needs consist primarily of general and administrative expenses and development expenditures at \nValencia and the Candlestick and The San Francisco Shipyard communities, interest payments under our senior notes and payments \nunder a related party reimbursement obligation. In January 2024, we exchanged $623.5 million of our existing 7.875% senior notes \ndue November 2025 for $100.0 million in cash and $523.5 million in new 10.500% initial rate senior notes due January 2028. The \nnew senior notes due January 2028 will accrue interest at a rate of 11.000% starting in November 2025 and at a rate of 12.000% \nstarting from November 2026 through the maturity date. In 2024, we will make aggregate interest payments of $54.1 million on our \nexisting and new senior notes, and $46.1 million in principal payments that were deferred from 2023 and are due under our related \nparty reimbursement obligation. Reimbursement payments may be deferred when our related party receives an extension on the \nmaturity date of the associated EB-5 loan liability. Our related party has a history of receiving maturity date extensions, however, such \nfurther extensions are not within our control and there can be no assurance that any such extensions will be obtained in the future.\nThe development stages of our communities continue to require significant cash outlays on both a short-term and long-term \nbasis, and we expect to invest significant amounts on continued horizontal development at Valencia over the next 12 months. We \nmanage our development activities and expenditures to coincide with projected demand for our residential and commercial land with \nthe objective of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity. We expect to meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months \nwith available cash, distributions from our unconsolidated entities, collection of management fees under our development management \nagreement with the Great Park Venture, proceeds from land sales, reimbursements from public financing in Valencia and access to \nfinancing sources, including our revolving credit facility.\nOur long-term cash needs relate primarily to future horizontal development expenditures and investments in or vertical \nconstruction costs for properties that we may acquire or develop for an income-producing portfolio, along with debt service and \nTable of Contents\n34\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential financial implications and strategic considerations for the company in managing its 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture, given the limitations on the manager's authority and the requirement for unanimous approval for major decisions?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/0696a4aea55931b006a2dd59370037a2.png"]}

We use non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual\noperating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board of Directors\nconcerning our financial performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors consistency and comparability with our past financial\nperformance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. We also believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating\nour operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as they generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary\nfor different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nInvestors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. The\nnon-GAAP financial measures we use may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for\ncomparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP items excluded from our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Non-GAAP free cash flow for the year ended January 31, 2024 was $269.0 million, representing an increase of 13% from the year ended \nJanuary 31, 2023. \nA reconciliation of non-GAAP free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented in the non-GAAP \nFinancial Measures section at the end of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is also not meant to be \nconsidered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nNet Retention Rate\nNet retention rate is defined as the net percentage of Total Annual Recurring Revenue (Total ARR) retained from existing customers, including \nexpansion. We define Total ARR as the annualized recurring revenue from all active customer contracts at the end of a reporting period. We calculate our net \nretention rate as of a period end by starting with the Total ARR from customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period Total ARR). We then \ncalculate Total ARR from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period Total ARR). Finally, we divide the Current Period Total ARR by \nthe Prior Period Total ARR to arrive at our net retention rate. In calculating our net retention rate, we include only Total ARR associated with those customers \nwho have subscribed to Box for at least 12 months. We believe our net retention rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our \nsubscription agreements and our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customer base. Net retention rate is an operational metric and there is no \ncomparable GAAP financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric.\nOur net retention rate was 101%, 108%, and 111% as of January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in our net retention rate as of \nJanuary 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to heightened budget scrutiny putting pressure on seat expansion within existing customers and increased customer \nchurn. As our customers purchase add-on products or our bundled Enterprise Plus plan, we tend to realize significantly higher average contract values and \nstronger net retention rates as compared to customers who only purchase our core product. We believe our go-to-market efforts to deliver a solution selling \nstrategy and our investments in product, customer success, and Box Consulting, including our Box Shuttle migration offering, have been significant factors in \nour customer retention results. As we penetrate customer accounts, we expect our net retention rate to remain above 100% for the foreseeable future.\n56\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What is the primary reason for the difference between the year-over-year percentage increase in GAAP revenue and the year-over-year percentage increase in Billings for the year ended January 31, 2024?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/3c8fe01fc661aef6efb38f49795e5a67.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\n\u00a0\nArea (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK) to the U.S. For example, on June 4, 2021, the EC published new standard contractual clauses (SCCs) \nthat were required to be implemented by companies relying on the SCCs as a basis for cross-border transfers of personal data by December 27, 2022. These or \nother developments relating to cross-border data transfer required us to issue additional policies, update our data transfer agreements with applicable customers \nand third-party service providers and assess our practices. This CJEU decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework and/or other legal \nchallenges relating to cross-border data transfers may serve as a basis for challenges to our personal data handling practices, or those of our customers, and may \notherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, European governments and the U.S. government have cooperated \nto adopt the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, UK-U.S. Data Bridge and Swiss-U.S. Framework (together, the \u201cData Privacy Framework\u201d) replacing the EU-\nU.S. Privacy Shield Framework. While the Data Privacy Framework could benefit the industry as a whole, and we presently maintain self-certification under \nthe Data Privacy Framework, maintaining compliance with the Data Privacy Framework could result in additional costs. The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework \nalso already has faced legal challenges, and more generally, the Data Privacy Framework may be subject to future reviews, and subject to suspension, \namendment, repeal, or limitations.\nBrexit has created uncertainty around data protection issues and could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. For example, the UK Data \nProtection Act of 2018 substantially mirrors the EU GDPR in the UK and was the subject of statutory amendments that further aligned it with the GDPR in \n2019. In June 2021, the EC announced a decision that the UK is an \u201cadequate country\u201d to which personal data could be exported from the EEA, but this \ndecision must be renewed and may face challenges in the future, creating uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data to the UK from the EEA. It remains \nunclear how UK data protection laws or regulations will develop, and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated, over time. In 2022, the \nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) issued the UK SCCs as a valid data transfer mechanism for cross border data transfers from the UK to third countries \nthat are required to be implemented by companies relying on the UK SCCs as a basis for cross-border transfers of personal data by March 21, 2024. Additional \nor modified guidance regarding, or changes to, UK cross border data transfers and/or overall UK data protection laws and/or guidance could occur, which may \nrequire us to change our policies, practices and engage in additional contractual negotiations. Such legislative and regulatory changes may result in increased \ncosts of compliance and limitations on our customers and us.\nIn 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became operative on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires \ncovered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales \nof personal information. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was approved by California voters in November 2020 and amended and \nexpanded the CCPA. The CPRA\u2019s substantive provisions became effective on January 1, 2023, and the newly formed California Privacy Protection Agency \nbegan its rulemaking process to adopt proposed regulations, with those regulations adopted on March 29, 2023. Our CPRA compliance efforts are subject to \nchange and may result in continued uncertainty and require additional costs and expenses to ensure readiness, compliance and decrease risks. Further, other \nstates have been considering, and in some cases enacting, laws relating to privacy and cybersecurity, many of which are comprehensive privacy statutes \nimposing obligations similar to the CCPA and CPRA. For example, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah enacted such legislation that became effective in \n2023, and Delaware, Tennessee, Iowa, Indiana, Montana, Florida, Oregon, Texas, New Hampshire, and New Jersey have enacted privacy laws that become \neffective between 2024 and 2026. In addition, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and North Carolina, amongst other U.S. states, are anticipated to follow suit. \nEfforts to comply with these laws and related fluctuations in laws relating to privacy and cybersecurity at the federal, state and local levels may impact \nreadiness and compliance, along with the potential to incur additional costs. We cannot fully predict the impact of these laws and other proposed federal and \nstate laws relating to privacy and cybersecurity on our business or operations, but they may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and \nincur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nIn addition, some countries, such as member states of the EEA are considering or have enacted legislation requiring storage localization and/or the \nprocessing of more regulated types of data in region, along with other limitations that could impact U.S. technology companies (e.g., cloud service providers) \nand more specifically, Box.

{"query": "Context:\n\n7 \nCompany\u2019s EU plants, or if the price of such allowances increases significantly, it could have a material effect on \nthe Company\u2019s financial condition and results. \nIn the Americas, the U.S., Mexico and Canada have engaged in significant legislative, regulatory and \nenforcement activities relating to greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions for years at the federal, state and provincial \nlevels of government. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) regulates emissions of GHG \nair pollutants under the Clean Air Act, which grants the EPA authority to establish limits for certain air pollutants \nand to require compliance, levy penalties and bring civil judicial action against violators.  The EPA\u2019s GHG \nregulations continue to evolve, as the structure and scope of the regulations are often the subject of litigation and \nfederal legislative activity.  New GHG regulations in any national or sub-national jurisdiction where the \nCompany operates could have a significant long-term material impact on the Company\u2019s operations that are \naffected by such regulations.  Several jurisdictions, including the states of California and Washington in the U.S., \nMexico, the Canadian federal government and the province of Quebec, among others, have adopted legislation \naimed at reducing GHG emissions, either by explicitly price-based (e.g., carbon tax) or cap-and-trade programs.  \nIn South American countries, national and local governments are also considering potential regulations to reduce \nGHG emissions. \n       For a further discussion of the effects of sustainability, climate change and ESG on the Company\u2019s business, \nsee Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters, Sustainability and Climate Change\u201d \nand Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d \nWorkplace Safety \nIn the U.S., the Company is subject to various state and federal regulatory agencies, such as the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), that assure safe and healthy working conditions by \nsetting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance.  Similar regulatory \nagencies focused on employee safety exist in other countries in which the Company operates around the world.  \nThe Company is committed to actively caring for the health and safety of its employees, as well as \ncontractors and visitors in all of the Company\u2019s facilities.  Hazards in the workplace are actively identified, and \nmanagement tracks incidents so that remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. \nThe Company is unable to predict what workplace safety legal requirements may be adopted in the future. \nHowever, the Company continually monitors its operations in relation to workplace safety and invests in projects \nto enhance employee safety.  As such, the Company has made significant expenditures on workplace safety \nimprovements at certain of its facilities over the last several years; however, these expenditures did not have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or cash flows.  The Company expects to see \ncontinued improvement in health and safety as a result of these projects. The Company is unable to predict the \nimpact of future health and safety legal requirements on its results of operations or cash flows. \nHuman Capital Resources \nThe Company\u2019s success and performance are directly related to the collective success and performance of \nevery employee.  The skills, experience and industry knowledge of its employees significantly benefit the \nCompany\u2019s operations and performance.  The Company has approximately 23,000 employees and 68 plants \nspread across 19 countries.  \nThe Company\u2019s core values of safety and well-being; diversity, equity and inclusion; passion;  \naccountability; and agility drive its behaviors.  Led by its people\u2019s knowledge and ambition, the Company is \ninnovating to meet its customers\u2019 ever-evolving needs to help build their brands and become valued partners.  To \nfacilitate talent attraction and retention, the Company seeks to provide a safe, inclusive, diverse, motivating and \ncollaborative work environment with opportunities for its employees to grow and develop in their careers, \nsupports employees through strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and identifies \nprograms that strive to build connections between its employees and their communities. \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow might the company's approach to workplace safety and human capital management potentially conflict with or complement its efforts to address climate change regulations and greenhouse gas emissions?", "response": "", "images": []}

Likewise, we were pleased to \nbe ranked far ahead of the pack and among other large, employee-owned, \nlong-term-oriented and engagement-focused firms in Institutional Investor\u2019s \ninaugural list of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Top Asset Management Firms,\u201d where 400 \nasset managers were graded, not by clients, but by company management \nteams: how well does the asset management firm know their company, \ntheir industry and their unique capital allocation processes? Insight and \nengagement won\u2019t always lead to near-term outperformance, but we \nbelieve that in the fullness of time, it yields the best results for clients. \nIn private markets, several different dynamics are at play. \nMany private clients are making their first commitments to private \nmarkets\u2014perhaps driven by the potential for higher and/or less volatile \nreturns than public market counterparts or a recognition of the growing \nimportance of private companies in the global economy. During 2022, \nNeuberger Berman put itself at the forefront of efforts to democratize \nprivate markets with the launch of vehicles available to broader segments \nof the investing public across several jurisdictions. \nAmong institutional investors, the leading surveys reveal some definite \ntrends. While it\u2019s still the case that more investors say they expect to \nincrease their allocations than decrease them during 2023, there has been \na notable rise in the proportion planning to decrease exposures, or saying \nthey are above their allocation limits. The most commonly cited reason for \nslowing, stopping or reversing allocations is the \u201cdenominator effect\u201d, \nwhereby a decline in overall portfolio value, due mainly to re-pricing of \npublic-market assets, raises the proportion allocated to private markets. \nThe big exceptions to this trend of slowing allocations are private equity \nsecondaries and private debt, where many investors are initiating or adding \ninvestments, especially in direct lending and special situations. \nThe underlying picture is increasingly clear: investors are finding it difficult \nto commit to private markets just as many leading General Partners are \nseeking to raise new, larger funds; and while that will make for a tougher \nfundraising environment in the near term, it also creates abundant \nopportunity for liquidity providers. \nFor example, if funds end up smaller, there are likely to be more co-investment \nopportunities, and fewer Limited Partners able to take them on\u2014our team \nhas already seen an uptick in offers. Private equity secondaries has become \na buyer\u2019s market as both Limited Partners and General Partners seek \nliquidity to manage their portfolios. Over the summer of 2022, we held \nthe final close for our fifth NB Secondary Opportunities Fund, at $4.9bn. \nThe raise exceeded our target, reflecting strong investor appetite for both \ntraditional LP- and GP-led secondaries, and the expectation that secondary \ninvestors may benefit from an increasingly illiquid environment. We think \nthe growth in GP-led secondaries is particularly interesting and, with over \n$100 bn under management in private markets across the capital structure, \na seat on over 300 Limited Partner Advisory Committees (LPACs) and 28 \ninvestment professionals dedicated to secondaries, we have the ability to \nstep into those situations quickly, grounded in years\u2014often decades\u2014of \nexperience with leading private equity firms. \nHigher rates, tighter credit conditions and banks under stress are also \npushing loan terms and yields in favor of private direct lenders.

Our two reportable business\nsegments are Harsco Environmental and Clean Earth and we are a single-thesis environmental solutions company that is a leader in the markets we serve.\nWe have worked in recent years to both transform our portfolio and strengthen our financial results, and we have invested to achieve these objectives and to\ngrow the Company. These investments include targeted organic investments, as well as mergers and acquisitions, that have accelerated our business\ntransformation. The purchases of Clean Earth and ESOL, along with the sale of our energy-linked business in 2019 and our plan to sell our Rail business,\nhave been significant strategic steps for our Company. As a result, 100% of our revenues from continuing operations in 2021 through 2023 were generated\nfrom our two environmentally-focused segments. It also is important to note that these transactions have reduced the Company\u2019s portfolio complexity and\nbusiness cyclicality.\nMore broadly, we are committed to viewing every customer need through a sustainability lens. Our customers expect customizable solutions that address\nenvironmental challenges within their industries. The Company is responding to this need by helping our customers build better businesses and, in a larger\nsense, a better environment. Our go-forward strategy is clear: to continue building a leading, global environmental solutions company.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company\u2019s current operations consist of two reportable business segments: Harsco Environmental and Clean Earth. Until the fourth quarter of 2021,\nthe Company reported the Harsco Rail segment.

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nThe growth and success of our DFC business is dependent upon obtaining sufficient capital to grow our auto loan portfolio.\nChanges in the availability or cost of financing to support our auto loan portfolio under DFC could adversely affect our results of operations. Our auto loan portfolio is funded through a\ncombination of free cash flows from operations and securitized funding, including asset-backed securitization. Changes in the condition of the asset backed securitization market may\nresult in increased costs to access funds in the market or require us to explore new financing options to fund new auto loans. In the event that there is no alternative financing available,\nwe may be forced to pause our auto loan financing business for a period of time. The impact of reducing or pausing our auto loan financing business could result in a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations.\nRisks associated with our international operations may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate dealerships in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. While our operations outside of the United States currently represent a small portion of our revenue, we anticipate\nthat our international operations will expand. We face regulatory, operational, political and economic risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that may be\ndifferent from those in the United States. These risks may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency translations within our financial statements driven by exchange rate volatility;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain or preserve franchise rights in the foreign countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in distribution models in the foreign countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\ncompliance with changing laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nwage inflation;\n\u2022\ntreatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax rules, including being subject to foreign tax laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing foreign operations and dealing with different customs, practices and local regulations with which we are less familiar;\n\u2022\nlarge uncertainties, timing delays and expenses associated with tariffs, labor matters, import or export licenses and other trade barriers; and\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession and interest rate fluctuations, and exposure to regional or global public health issues,\npandemics, or epidemics, such as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\nChanges to the retail delivery model and increased e-commerce and omni-channel competition could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition\nand cash flows.\nThe automotive industry is beginning to experience change and disruption in the retail delivery model, including growing competition in the used vehicle market from companies with a\nprimarily online e-commerce business model. Competition in this market includes companies such as CarMax, Carvana, and Cazoo. In addition, larger traditional automotive retailers are\ntransforming their models to support omni-channel retail experiences, providing consumers with vehicle purchasing experiences outside of the traditional brick and mortar automotive\ndealership model.\nWe continue to develop our own internal technology solutions to further expand the reach of the networks of service and delivery points in our geographic markets. We may face\nincreased competition for market share with these other delivery models and omni-channel retailers over time which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. There\ncan be no assurance that our initiatives will be successful or that the amount we invest in these initiatives will result in our maintaining market share and continued or improved financial\nperformance.\nBreaches in our data security systems or in systems used by our vendor partners, including cyber-attacks or unauthorized data distribution by employees or affiliated\nvendors, or disruptions to access and connectivity of our information systems could impact our operations or result in the loss or misuse of customers\u2019 proprietary\ninformation.\n14\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow might changes in the automotive retail landscape and international expansion potentially create conflicting challenges for a company like the one described in managing its technology infrastructure and data security?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/156c6f357c25dba226288b0d2f0659f3.png"]}

We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business,\nwhich are typically cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory\ncommitments.

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash\nreceived from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy\ncosts, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any\npoint in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and\npayments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $6.6 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily driven by changes in working\ncapital, partially offset by a decrease in net earnings. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by lower inventory purchases in fiscal\n2023 relative to fiscal 2022, as well as timing of vendor payments.

Sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square\nfootage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company\u2019s retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square\nfootage for these retail operations.\nFISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022\nSales\nWe assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.\nNet Sales. Net sales for fiscal 2023 decreased $4.7 billion, or 3.0%, to $152.7 billion. The decrease in net sales for fiscal 2023 primarily reflects\nthe impact of a negative comparable sales environment, primarily driven by a decrease in comparable customer transactions as well as the\nimpact from lumber price deflation.\nOnline sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or\ndelivered to customer locations, represented 14.8% of net sales and increased by 1.1% during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nA weaker U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by $276\u00a0million in fiscal 2023.\nComparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the\nchange in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical\nand online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on\nthe Monday following their 52  week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more\nthan 52 weeks. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nTotal comparable sales decreased\u00a03.2%\u00a0in fiscal\u00a02023, reflecting a 2.9% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 0.3% decrease in\ncomparable average ticket compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease in comparable customer transactions reflects the impact of macroeconomic\nfactors, including the continued shift in consumer consumption trends away from goods and towards services and the impact of a higher interest\nrate environment, pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable average ticket reflects U.S. commodity price deflation,\nwhich negatively impacted average ticket by approximately 145 basis points, driven primarily by lumber. This was partially offset by inflation\nacross several product categories, which slowed relative to prior years, along with demand for new and innovative products.\nFor fiscal 2023, four of our 14 merchandising departments\u2014Building Materials, Outdoor Garden, Hardware, and Plumbing\u2014posted positive\ncomparable sales compared to fiscal 2022. All of our other merchandising departments posted negative comparable sales during fiscal 2023\ncompared to fiscal 2022, with our Lumber department posting a double-digit comparable sales decline primarily resulting from lumber price\ndeflation, partially offset by higher unit sales.\nGross Profit\nGross profit\u00a0decreased\u00a0$1.8 billion, or 3.4%,\u00a0to\u00a0$51.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin,\nwas\u00a033.4% in fiscal 2023\u00a0compared to\u00a033.5% in fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin primarily reflects price stabilization as well as\nreduction and optimization of our inventory position, partially offset by lower supply chain costs.\nWhile we continue to experience shrink above historical averages, year-over-year pressure to gross profit margin from shrink decreased as we\nmoved through fiscal 2023. As a result, shrink did not have a significant impact on our gross profit margin in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.\nnd\nFiscal 2023 Form 10-K\n29\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow did Home Depot's comparable sales performance in fiscal 2023 compare to its overall net sales performance, and what factors contributed to the difference between these two metrics?", "response": "", "images": []}

Our capital allocation is\ndiscussed further in Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOUR CUSTOMERS\nWe serve two primary customer groups \u2014 consumers (including both DIY and DIFM customers) and professional customers \u2014 and have\ndeveloped varying approaches to meet their diverse needs:\nDIY Customers\nThese customers are typically homeowners who purchase products and complete their own projects and installations. Our associates assist\nthese customers both in our stores and through online resources and other media designed to provide product and project knowledge. We also\noffer a variety of clinics and workshops both to share this knowledge and to build an emotional connection with our DIY customers. As the\npreferences and behaviors of our DIY customers are changing, we are investing in capabilities to better serve the needs of those customers.\nProfessional Customers (or \u201cPros\u201d)\nThese customers are primarily professional renovators/remodelers, general contractors, maintenance professionals, handymen, property\nmanagers, building service contractors and specialty tradespeople, such as electricians, plumbers and painters. These customers build,\nrenovate, remodel, repair, and maintain residential properties, multifamily properties, hospitality properties, and commercial facilities, including\neducation, healthcare, government, institutional, and office buildings.\nWe have a number of initiatives designed to drive growth with Pros, including those working on both simple and complex projects. We remain\nfocused on providing a customized online experience, a dedicated sales force, a broad assortment of Pro-focused products and brands, an\nextensive delivery network, our Pro Xtra loyalty program, and enhanced credit offerings. Building on our historical strength as a destination for\nurgent purchase needs, we are investing in differentiated capabilities that will help us better serve our Pros\u2019 complex purchase needs, including\nexpanded supply chain capabilities, additional trade credit offerings, more showroom space, and an enhanced order management system.\nWe serve the MRO marketplace through our subsidiary HD Supply, a leading national distributor and provider of MRO products and related\nvalue-added services to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and government housing facilities, among others. Our MRO operations use a\ndistribution center-based model that sells products primarily through a professional sales force and through e-commerce platforms and print\ncatalogs.\nIn October 2023, we announced changes to our leadership structure, aligning our outside sales and service business with our global store\norganization to better serve our Pros by leveraging our full ecosystem and newest capabilities. We recognize the great value our Pros provide to\ntheir clients, and we strive to make their jobs easier and help them grow their businesses, from expanded capabilities to improve their business\nand customer experience to the Path to Pro network we are building for Pros to connect with jobseekers to help address the skilled labor\nshortage. We believe that investments aimed at deepening our relationships with our Pros are yielding increased engagement and will continue\nto translate into incremental sales to these customers.\nDIFM Customers\nIntersecting our DIY customers and our Pros are our DIFM customers. These customers are typically homeowners who use Pros to complete\ntheir project or installation. Currently, we offer installation services in a variety of categories, such as flooring, water heaters, bath, garage doors,\ncabinets, cabinet makeovers, countertops, sheds, furnaces and central air systems, and windows. DIFM customers can purchase these services\nin our stores, online, or in their homes through in-home consultations. In addition to serving our DIFM customer needs, we believe our focus on\nthe Pros who perform services for these customers helps us drive higher product sales.\nOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nA typical The Home Depot store stocks approximately 30,000 to 40,000 items during the year, including both national brand name and\nproprietary products.

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur Solution: The IronNet Collective Defense Platform\nOur anonymized IronNet Collective Defense platform comprises two tightly integrated proprietary technologies: Our NDR solution, IronDefense, and our innovative collective threat-sharing solution, IronDome.\nOur platform offers a unified set of technologies that powers a wide range of network behavioral detection, security operations, real- time threat landscape visibility, threat sharing, and peer SOC-analyst collaboration \ncapabilities. By focusing on cloud deployments, we are able to more rapidly and cost effectively deploy in our customers' environments, 83.6% of which by revenue were in the public cloud as of January 31, 2023. Our \nexpanding set of open APIs and ecosystem integrations enable us to add new sources of data for behavioral analysis and Collective Defense sharing and collaboration to detect and stop targeted cyber attacks.\nArmed with elite detection capabilities and combined offensive operator experience at the highest level of the U.S. government, our founders set out to build a behavioral analytics solution to detect threats heading toward, \nor already in, the network. A growing portfolio of proprietary analytics forms the backbone of IronDefense.\nHowever, while effective in detecting unknown anomalies, behavioral analytics by itself is insufficient in modern, noisy networks where anomalies are common and can lead to a high number of false positives. For many \nNDR vendors in the industry, the solution is to tune their analytics to be less sensitive in order to deliver reduced false-positive rates at the expense of letting true positives into the network. We undertook a different strategy \nto meet this challenge. We introduced our expert system scoring algorithms, supported by our elite cyber hunters, to increase IronDefense's detection specificity while preserving the sensitivity of its analytics.\nPowered by IronDefense\u2019s threat detections, IronDome, which we introduced in 2018, is the foundation of our Collective Defense platform, a purpose-built, cloud-native, and holistic platform that is capable of defending, \nanalyzing, and correlating threats from various sources. It delivers timely, actionable, and contextual insights to attacks targeting an enterprise and, from there, is able to provide early warning to all members of the \nCollective Defense ecosystem.\nThe differentiated value of our Collective Defense platform is its ability to build a dynamic, comprehensive picture of the threat environment, much like radar for cyberspace, based on real-time, anonymized alert correlation \nacross any participating member environments. It also provides situational context and peer insights for greater visibility and context of the threat landscape at any given time.\nIn August 2022, we announced our membership in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (\"JCDC\") and an agreement with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\"CISA\") to share information from our \nCollective Defense platform to help the agency defend against increased global cyber threats. In February 2023, we formalized a new public sector partnership establishing a communications channel between our threat \nanalysts and the DoD. The channel is intended to facilitate active collaboration of known and emerging threats, enabling us to inform the DoD of threat activity in near real time and vice versa. Through this public-private \npartnership, our anonymized IronDome data, in addition to our IronRadar visibility into key threat related C2 Server findings, is an important advancement of our collective defense mission.\nCorrelated alerts for threat detection earlier in the intrusion cycle\nWe are not aware of any other vendor in the market with a similar approach to cybersecurity. Even though community members bring disparate network environments, such as cloud, on-premise or hybrid, to the Collective \nDefense ecosystem, correlated threats stand out given that the adversarial behaviors are typically consistent, no matter who the target is.\nOur Collective Defense platform comprises two flagship products:\nIronDefense\nIronDefense is an advanced NDR solution that provides behavior-based and AI-driven analytics at the network level to detect anomalous activity at individual enterprises and prioritize the highest threats in a company\u2019s \nnetwork. We leverage novel AI/ML algorithms to deliver high-fidelity analytics required to detect previously unknown threats. In addition, we provide advanced enrichment techniques via IronDefense\u2019s Expert System, \nwhich has been designed to achieve high efficacy levels, low false positive rates, and improved visibility compared to legacy approaches. This is all done at network speed and cloud scale.\nMost current cybersecurity tools focus on detecting the final \u201caction-on-target\u201d step of an intrusion. At this stage, identification is easier but the insights come far too late to stop attackers from getting into positions in the \nnetwork to exfiltrate data, steal IP, or accomplish other malicious objectives. IronDefense uses advanced analytics based on metadata from the traffic in the customer\u2019s network to identify anomalous activity earlier in the \nintrusion kill chain.\nKey components of IronDefense include:\n10\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the \"New Approach\" described in the image fundamentally change the way organizations collaborate and share information about cyber threats compared to the \"Old Approach\"?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/bb41a10e6ad552e10d9bc9f763c383a9.png"]}

year 2022.\nProduct, subscription and support revenue increased by $0.4 million or 1% primarily due to the net effect of our transition from contracts that had non-recurring elements which did not renew in full, replaced by revenues from contract \nforms that were designed to fully renew with legacy customers and signing new customers.\nProfessional services revenue decreased by $0.6 million or 29% in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the volume of professional services provided to customers during fiscal year 2023.\nCost of revenue\nTotal cost of

Cost of product, subscription and support revenue increased by $5.2 million or 64%, in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year \n2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cloud subscription customers, costs incurred to fully ramp cloud hosting environments related to a significant revenue customer that was onboarded in the second half of fiscal year \n2023, an increase in allocated labor costs related to software support services, duplicative charges that occurred while certain customers transitioned from their on-premises to cloud hosted deployment formats, and the establishment of \nan inventory reserve during fiscal year 2023.\nCost of professional service revenue decreased by $0.6 million or 55% in fiscal year 2023, compared to fiscal year 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in headcount and a decrease in the volume of professional services \nprovided to customers.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nCertain business decisions related to cost of revenue resulted in a decrease in product subscription, and support gross margin to 48% in fiscal year 2023, which would have been approximately 58% during the period when excluding the \nexpense incurred related to establishing an inventory reserve, as compared to 68% in fiscal year 2022, and an increase in professional services gross margin to 66% in fiscal year 2023 as compared to 47% in fiscal year 2022. The period \nover period decrease in margin for software was primarily the result of cloud costs for a significant revenue customer that ramped up in the second half of fiscal year 2023, as well as duplicative charges that occurred while certain \ncustomers transitioned from their on-premises to cloud hosted deployment formats, the establishment of an inventory \n42\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What factors contributed to the change in gross profit margin from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, and how did these factors impact the overall financial performance?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/c8ec61af4ee6ead98f5d47bc73abfcc6.png"]}

{"query": "<image><image>Context:\n\nTable of Contents\nCOMPASS MINERALS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nOur SOP sales are primarily concentrated in the Western and Southeastern U.S. where the crops and soil conditions favor the use of low-chloride potassium\nnutrients.\u00a0Consequently, weather patterns and field conditions in these locations can impact Plant Nutrition sales volumes.\nWhile long-term global consumption of potash has increased in response to growing populations and the need for additional food supplies, the market for\ncommodity potash has been challenged in recent years due to downturns in the broader crop market which pressure grower incomes.\u00a0However, recently improved\neconomics for row crops has led to an improved commodity potash market. Additionally, demand for our SOP products has been resilient despite the challenges\nfacing the global potash market.\nWe expect the long-term demand for potassium nutrients to continue to grow as arable land per capita decreases, thereby encouraging improved crop yield\nefficiencies. We expect our future growth to stem from the conversion of certain commodity potassium applications into higher yield SOP applications.\nApproximately 91% of our Plant Nutrition segment sales in fiscal 2023 were made to U.S. customers, who include retail fertilizer dealers and distributors of\nagricultural products as well as professional turf care customers. In some cases, these dealers and distributors combine or blend our Plant Nutrition segment\nproducts with other fertilizers and minerals to produce fertilizer blends tailored to individual requirements.\nProducts and Sales\nWe currently generate nearly all of our sales and earnings in our Plant Nutrition segment through the production and sale of SOP. Our SOP is sold in various\ngrades under our Protassium+ brand. Our Protassium+ product line consists of different grades sized for use in broadcast spreaders, direct application and liquid\nfertilizer solutions. Our turf product line consists of grades sized for use by the turf and ornamental markets and for blends used on golf course greens. We also\nprovide an organic product line with grades sized for a wide range of applications.\nOur Protassium+ product line is generally sold to crop input distributors and dealers who may blend our products with other fertilizer products to sell to\nfarmers and growers, or it may be sold as the final product. Our commercial efforts focus on educating and selling the agronomic benefits of SOP as a source of\npotassium nutrients.\nCompetition\nSOP is marketed globally, with approximately 55% of the world\u2019s 10 million tons of estimated capacity located in China. Management estimates global SOP\ncapacity to be as follows:\nSource: Green Markets \u00ae A Bloomberg Company\nWe are the leading SOP producer and marketer in North America and we also market SOP products internationally, depending on market conditions. Our\nmajor competition for SOP sales in North America includes imports from the European Union. Fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies in relation to the\nU.S. dollar coupled with Baltic freight rates impact the level of international competition we face. As the only SOP producer with production facilities in North\nAmerica, and as a result of our logistically favorable production site near Ogden, Utah, we estimate that our share of the North American market is sizable. In\naddition to imported SOP, there is functional competition between SOP and other forms of potassium crop nutrients, such as MOP.\u00a0The specialty plant nutrient\nmarket is highly fragmented.\u00a0Commodity and specialty crops require specialty plant nutrients in varying degrees depending on the crop and soil conditions.\n\u00a08\n2023 FORM 10-K\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: According to management estimates, what percentage of the global SOP capacity is located outside of China, Europe, and North America?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/00d57287a1893dbf266e092e58a7e6d4.png", "data/qwen_images/e64c822e53e43413c0e2e27feb327157.png"]}

{"query": "<image><image><image><image>Context:\n\n12\nOven Vents\nThe oven vents release hot air and moisture from the ovens and \nshould not be blocked or covered. Blocking or covering the vents \nwill cause poor air circulation, affecting cooking and cleaning \nresults. Do not set plastics, paper, or other items that could melt \nor\u00a0burn near the oven vents.\nBaking and Roasting\nPreheating\nWhen beginning a Bake cycle, the oven will begin preheating \nafter Start is pressed. The oven will take approximately 12 \nto 15\u00a0minutes to reach 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) with all of the oven \nracks provided with your oven inside the oven cavity. Higher \ntemperatures will take longer to preheat. The preheat cycle rapidly \nincreases the oven temperature. The actual oven temperature \nwill go above your set temperature to offset the heat lost when \nyour oven door is opened to insert food. This ensures that when \nyou place your food in the oven, the oven will begin at the proper \ntemperature. Insert your food when the preheat tone sounds. \nDo\u00a0not open the door during preheat before the tone sounds.\nRapid Preheat\nRapid Preheat can be used to shorten the preheating time. Only \none standard flat oven rack should be in the oven during Rapid \nPreheat. Extra racks should be removed prior to starting Rapid \nPreheat. The preheating cycle should be completed before placing \nfood in the oven. When the Rapid Preheat cycle is complete, the \noven starts a normal Bake cycle.\nIMPORTANT: Rapid Preheat should be used only for single-rack \nbaking.\nOven Temperature\nWhile in use, the oven elements will cycle on and off as needed \nto maintain a consistent temperature, but they may run slightly \nhot or cool at any point in time due to this cycling. Opening the \noven door while in use will release the hot air and cool the oven \nwhich could impact the cooking time and performance. It is \nrecommended to use the oven light to monitor cooking progress.\nNOTE: On models with convection, the convection fan may run in \nthe non-convection Bake mode to improve oven performance.\nAccuBake\u00ae Temperature Management System\nThe AccuBake\u00ae Temperature Management System electronically \nregulates the oven heat levels during preheat and bake to maintain \na precise temperature range for optimal cooking results. The bake \nand broil elements or burners cycle on and off in intervals. On \nconvection range models, the fan will run while preheating and \nmay be cycled on and off for short intervals during bake to provide \nthe best results. This feature is automatically activated when the \noven is in use.\nBefore baking and roasting, position racks according to the \n\u201cPositioning Racks and Bakeware\u201d section. When roasting, it is \nnot necessary to wait for the oven preheat cycle to end before \nputting food in unless it is recommended in the recipe.\nFrozen Bake\u2122 Technology\nFrozen Bake\u2122 Technology can be used to cook prepackaged \nfrozen food without needing to preheat the oven and without \noverbrowning the food. There are 4 preprogrammed food options \nto choose from: Pizza, Lasagna, Nuggets/Fries, and Pie. Frozen \nBake\u2122 Technology should only be used for these foods. Cook \nonly 1 package at a time when using Frozen Bake\u2122 Technology. \nUse the recommended temperature and maximum recommended \ntime from the packaging.\nA beep will alert you to check the food\u2019s doneness before the \ncook time is completed and again at the end of the cook time. The \ndisplay will prompt you to add to the cook time or end the cycle.\nBroiling\nWhen broiling, preheat the oven for 5 minutes before putting food \nin unless recommended otherwise in the recipe. Leave the desired \noven door open 41/2\" (114 mm) at the broil stop position to ensure \nproper broiling temperature. Position food on grid in a broiler pan, \nand then place it in the center of the oven rack.\nNOTE: Odors and smoke are normal the first few times the oven \nis\u00a0used or if the oven is heavily soiled.\nChanging the temperature when broiling allows more precise \ncontrol when cooking. The lower the broil setting is, the slower the \ncooking. Thicker cuts and unevenly shaped pieces of meat, fish, \nand poultry may cook better at lower broil settings. Refer to the \n\u201cPositioning Racks and Bakeware\u201d section for more information.\nOn lower settings, the broil element will cycle on and off to \nmaintain the proper temperature.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFor best results, use a broiler pan and grid. It is designed to \ndrain juices and help avoid spatter and smoke.\nIf you would like to purchase a broiler pan, one may be \nordered. See the \u201cAccessories\u201d section.\nLower Oven Convection Cooking\nIn a convection oven, the fan-circulated hot air continually \ndistributes heat more evenly than the natural movement of air in a \nstandard thermal oven. This movement of hot air helps maintain a \nconsistent temperature throughout the oven, cooking foods more \nevenly, crisping surfaces while sealing in moisture, and yielding \ncrustier breads.\nIf the oven door is opened during convection cooking, the fan \nwill\u00a0turn off immediately. It will come back on when the oven \ndoor\u00a0is closed.\nNOTE: The oven door must be closed for convection broiling.\nPosition the racks according to the \u201cPositioning Racks and \nBakeware\u201d section before starting convection cooking.\nWith convection cooking, most foods can be cooked at a lower \ntemperature or for a shorter length of time.\nA\nB\nA.\t Upper oven vent\nB.\t Lower oven vent\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Where are the oven vents located on this range model, and why is their positioning important for proper oven function?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/2a85d3a79b7b5a635e1c8cee9419c3db.png", "data/qwen_images/cd1b9d6faa8d9e354f941c7994a005e8.png", "data/qwen_images/4d4b5922390f1f69358b7ff69b33c852.png", "data/qwen_images/282aaa3a35a85dcf72870cbd7f16e2e4.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\nDue to the increased density of semiconductors used in recent Dell products, the sensitivity to static damage is now higher than\nin previous Dell products. For this reason, some previously approved methods of handling parts are no longer applicable.\nTwo recognized types of ESD damage are catastrophic and intermittent failures.\n\u25cf\nCatastrophic \u2013 Catastrophic failures represent approximately 20 percent of ESD-related failures. The damage causes\nan immediate and complete loss of device functionality. An example of catastrophic failure is a memory DIMM that has\nreceived a static shock and immediately generates a \"No POST/No Video\" symptom with a beep code emitted for missing or\nnonfunctional memory.\n\u25cf\nIntermittent \u2013 Intermittent failures represent approximately 80 percent of ESD-related failures. The high rate of\nintermittent failures means that most of the time when damage occurs, it is not immediately recognizable. The DIMM\nreceives a static shock, but the tracing is merely weakened and does not immediately produce outward symptoms related to\nthe damage. The weakened trace may take weeks or months to melt, and in the meantime may cause degradation of memory\nintegrity, intermittent memory errors, etc.\nThe more difficult type of damage to recognize and troubleshoot is the intermittent (also called latent or \"walking wounded\")\nfailure.\nPerform the following steps to prevent ESD damage:\n\u25cf\nUse a wired ESD wrist strap that is properly grounded. The use of wireless anti-static straps is no longer allowed; they do not\nprovide adequate protection. Touching the chassis before handling parts does not ensure adequate ESD protection on parts\nwith increased sensitivity to ESD damage.\n\u25cf\nHandle all static-sensitive components in a static-safe area. If possible, use anti-static floor pads and workbench pads.\n\u25cf\nWhen unpacking a static-sensitive component from its shipping carton, do not remove the component from the anti-static\npacking material until you are ready to install the component. Before unwrapping the anti-static packaging, ensure that you\ndischarge static electricity from your body.\n\u25cf\nBefore transporting a static-sensitive component, place it in an anti-static container or packaging.\nESD field service kit\nThe unmonitored Field Service kit is the most commonly used service kit. Each Field Service kit includes three main components:\nanti-static mat, wrist strap, and bonding wire.\nComponents of an ESD field service kit\nThe components of an ESD field service kit are:\n\u25cf\nAnti-Static Mat \u2013 The anti-static mat is dissipative and parts can be placed on it during service procedures. When using an\nanti-static mat, your wrist strap should be snug and the bonding wire should be connected to the mat and to any bare metal\non the system being worked on. Once deployed properly, service parts can be removed from the ESD bag and placed directly\non the mat. ESD-sensitive items are safe in your hand, on the ESD mat, in the system, or inside a bag.\n\u25cf\nWrist Strap and Bonding Wire \u2013 The wrist strap and bonding wire can be either directly connected between your wrist\nand bare metal on the hardware if the ESD mat is not required, or connected to the anti-static mat to protect hardware that\nis temporarily placed on the mat. The physical connection of the wrist strap and bonding wire between your skin, the ESD\nmat, and the hardware is known as bonding. Use only Field Service kits with a wrist strap, mat, and bonding wire. Never\nuse wireless wrist straps. Always be aware that the internal wires of a wrist strap are prone to damage from normal wear\nand tear, and must be checked regularly with a wrist strap tester in order to avoid accidental ESD hardware damage. It is\nrecommended to test the wrist strap and bonding wire at least once per week.\n\u25cf\nESD Wrist Strap Tester \u2013 The wires inside of an ESD strap are prone to damage over time. When using an unmonitored\nkit, it is a best practice to regularly test the strap prior to each service call, and at a minimum, test once per week. A\nwrist strap tester is the best method for doing this test. If you do not have your own wrist strap tester, check with your\nregional office to find out if they have one. To perform the test, plug the wrist-strap's bonding-wire into the tester while it is\nstrapped to your wrist and push the button to test. A green LED is lit if the test is successful; a red LED is lit and an alarm\nsounds if the test fails.\n\u25cf\nInsulator Elements \u2013 It is critical to keep ESD sensitive devices, such as plastic heat sink casings, away from internal parts\nthat are insulators and often highly charged.\n\u25cf\nWorking Environment \u2013 Before deploying the ESD Field Service kit, assess the situation at the customer location. For\nexample, deploying the kit for a server environment is different than for a desktop or portable environment. Servers are\ntypically installed in a rack within a data center; desktops or portables are typically placed on office desks or cubicles. Always\nlook for a large open flat work area that is free of clutter and large enough to deploy the ESD kit with additional space to\naccommodate the type of system that is being repaired. The workspace should also be free of insulators that can cause an\nESD event. On the work area, insulators such as Styrofoam and other plastics should always be moved at least 12 inches or\n30 centimeters away from sensitive parts before physically handling any hardware components\n32\nWorking inside your computer\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the two types of ESD damage recognized in Dell products, and how do they differ in terms of their impact on device functionality and the visibility of symptoms?", "response": "", "images": []}

Propagation sensors, such as IMUs, provide continuous measurements of the agent's motion, enabling the estimation of its position and orientation over time. Update sensors, including cameras, GNSS, magnetometers, and barometers, offer discrete measurements that correct the drift in the propagation estimates, improving the accuracy of the agent's position and orientation. Joint sensors, such as relative pose and range/bearing sensors, facilitate inter-agent communication and coordination, allowing agents to share information about their relative positions and orientations.\n\nThe integration of these sensors in a distributed multi-agent system presents several challenges and benefits. Challenges include managing the diverse sensor data, ensuring synchronization among agents, and handling sensor failures or dropouts. Benefits include enhanced robustness and accuracy in state estimation, improved situational awareness, and the ability to adapt to changing sensor configurations. By leveraging the strengths of different sensors, the system can achieve more reliable navigation and decision-making, even in dynamic and uncertain environments. The distributed nature of the system allows for scalability and fault tolerance, making it suitable for large-scale missions and complex tasks.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[24,89,99,101,146,100,111,75,182,97,79,149,95,16,17,74,105,114,76,108,162,9,102,5,93,106,178,77,104,151,145,160,177,83,96,179,194,201,20,128,192,203,205,110,193,195,18,23,82,180,183,21,72,124,204,88,196,15,19,98,152,14,28,113,132,115,150,166,86,197,122,121,131,148,206,223,10,22,107,116,123,212,94,184,202,221,81,191,207,215,130,199,85,214,210,158,11,84,134,157,181,198,109,117,164,6,147,90,161,185,190,25,87,13,126,133,220,125,53,42,208,209,218,29,59,73,217,222,50,159,155,127,129,156,211,8,142,143,189,216,48,119,213,63,120,153,174,154,118,35,200,169,188,46,78,27,69,43,45,55,144,70,103,80,4,31,49,26,165,57,186,224,32,71,1,64,163,44,54,60,141,219,92,68,112,30,40,187,36,39,139,167,140,33,37,47,137,67,62,91,136,225,34,41,58,51,56,138,172,168,38,52,65,170,66,171,135,175,3,176,61,173,12,7,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Further exploration of these operations, such as adding more complex binary functions or optimizing their coefficients, could lead to even more effective loss functions.\n\n3. **Balancing the Search Space**: Ensuring a more balanced representation of binary and unary operators in the search space could help the algorithm explore a wider range of potential loss functions, potentially leading to better generalization and performance.\n\nThese insights can guide the development of more efficient and effective loss function learning algorithms.","source":"data/test/2406.09713.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[77,159,52,70,53,74,76,79,80,49,78,84,54,3,158,64,160,61,66,81,51,67,105,85,56,72,163,22,57,63,91,55,82,73,44,68,83,65,45,47,71,93,157,75,46,69,17,50,8,175,37,131,21,168,171,164,169,165,154,12,119,170,180,167,178,36,176,145,150,59,144,151,129,130,10,38,116,181,15,23,172,86,60,101,179,161,166,34,62,182,134,141,173,98,40,106,122,162,30,126,133,136,32,88,96,107,117,123,42,137,140,155,177,41,58,109,19,26,132,152,16,25,124,31,104,127,174,5,94,113,13,39,143,20,27,29,102,108,142,128,111,135,138,28,87,110,146,7,95,99,103,9,147,100,148,33,115,118,149,120,121,11,14,139,90,97,153,18,35,92,43,112,6,114,125,1,48,4,89,2,156,24],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}]}

Unlike the traditional division operator, which can lead to undefined or imaginary outputs when applied to negative numbers or zero, the AQ operator ensures that the loss function remains well-defined and computationally stable. This is crucial for maintaining the GP closure property, which requires that the loss function not produce NaN (Not a Number), Inf (Infinity), undefined, or complex outputs.\n\nThe AQ operator is defined as \\( x_1 / \\sqrt{1 + x_2^2} \\), which is a continuous and differentiable function. This formulation ensures that the loss function is always finite and smooth, even when dealing with extreme values or negative inputs. This stability is essential for the evolutionary process in GP, as it prevents premature termination due to undefined operations and facilitates the optimization of the loss function coefficients.\n\nCompared to the traditional division operator, the AQ operator offers several advantages:\n1. **Stability**: It avoids the issues of division by zero or negative numbers, ensuring the loss function remains well-behaved.\n2. **Differentiability**: It is differentiable, which is crucial for the gradient-based optimization used in EvoMAL.\n3. **Smoothness**: It provides a smooth transition, which is beneficial for the evolutionary algorithm's convergence.\n4. **Portability**: It maintains the interpretability and portability of the loss function, making it easier to transfer to new problems.\n\nIn summary, the AQ operator enhances the robustness and efficiency of the EvoMAL framework by ensuring that the loss functions are both interpretable and computationally stable, thereby improving the overall performance and reliability of the evolved loss functions.","source":"data/test/2406.09713.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[53,52,57,176,159,61,74,77,64,158,49,54,79,55,51,91,71,45,84,22,67,70,76,160,63,3,105,65,78,56,80,59,69,85,66,82,44,81,157,72,163,75,173,47,175,8,36,46,58,181,68,34,93,37,62,73,17,83,131,180,182,40,165,171,15,117,145,164,166,21,96,115,132,154,167,98,168,169,177,7,13,116,161,170,172,35,42,107,109,140,138,141,174,179,32,50,122,12,23,123,143,151,86,106,113,136,19,20,30,60,5,99,119,134,155,178,10,18,28,87,29,124,25,41,43,88,89,130,148,150,110,111,144,90,92,133,137,16,31,100,101,118,128,142,149,27,95,129,152,162,1,38,39,33,108,139,14,97,126,112,114,9,127,135,6,94,120,26,102,146,153,125,11,104,4,121,147,48,2,103,24,156],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Novice inspectors, while initially more expensive per issue, become more efficient with experience.\n\nThis relationship indicates that both novice and expert inspectors become more cost-effective at identifying key issues as they identify more of them, but experts maintain a higher overall cost compared to novice inspectors regardless of the number of issues identified.","source":"data/test/2408.06955.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[90,122,92,88,123,89,115,75,98,84,114,10,74,97,86,99,15,121,126,108,79,91,113,77,110,78,96,65,95,81,85,141,80,82,93,118,32,73,83,120,66,94,128,64,67,19,116,117,8,53,72,143,30,31,69,20,33,45,125,13,68,111,11,107,71,136,105,112,104,129,14,87,142,100,35,16,23,24,50,55,27,103,46,47,51,29,42,106,109,131,135,37,52,54,57,70,49,18,48,58,76,102,134,12,59,139,43,41,60,137,44,40,56,61,138,25,62,132,22,34,130,133,26,9,2,39,38,5,4,140,17,1,6,144,36,21,28,7,124,127,3,101,119,63],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

By examining strategic behavior, the authors are likely investigating vulnerabilities in the screening mechanisms and exploring ways to mitigate these manipulations.\n\nTogether, these sections indicate that the authors are not only concerned with achieving fairness in screening processes but also with understanding and addressing the strategic behavior that can undermine fairness. This dual focus implies a multidimensional approach to ensuring that screening processes are both effective and equitable, considering both the technical aspects of fairness and the behavioral dynamics that can affect outcomes.","source":"data/test/2408.16040.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,11,13,141,7,122,183,185,104,105,179,191,84,5,81,86,119,194,190,60,184,83,186,192,8,15,127,182,102,128,152,66,89,125,18,85,139,12,103,123,187,189,88,91,69,96,188,126,138,51,100,41,129,47,106,193,56,80,67,90,116,40,82,93,120,10,25,59,114,115,142,49,97,2,180,14,99,92,50,52,107,57,58,87,42,124,133,146,101,53,62,68,30,31,32,94,54,55,155,181,16,21,140,23,61,79,17,24,130,150,154,195,151,44,63,65,95,137,98,1,45,74,76,135,27,38,156,165,29,26,174,108,163,170,166,4,149,159,169,37,173,28,117,160,171,36,73,77,134,136,157,9,71,110,132,144,164,19,20,153,177,48,143,158,175,43,64,147,35,131,33,46,168,39,70,75,145,148,112,121,176,78,178,161,109,3,34,167,162,72,111,118,172,22,113],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The l-ortho and ortho methods also show a decrease, but their performance is slightly better than the linear method, especially at higher anchor counts.\n\nThe observed trends in reconstruction error can be explained by the increasing accuracy of the latent translation methods as more anchors are used. More anchors provide a richer representation of the latent space, allowing for more precise translations. The affine and linear methods, being simpler, benefit from the additional information provided by more anchors, leading to better reconstruction. The l-ortho and ortho methods, which are more complex and involve optimization, also improve with more anchors but maintain a slight edge over the linear method.

The Sinkhorn algorithm, originally designed for optimal transport problems, is adapted here to estimate a correspondence matrix Π that maps embeddings from one domain to another. This matrix is used to approximate the remaining parallel anchors by optimizing over the embeddings of the target domain.\n\nIn each iteration, the Sinkhorn algorithm is applied to estimate Π using the current set of parallel anchors and the embeddings of the target domain. This estimated correspondence is then used to optimize the embeddings of the target domain, aiming to minimize the mean squared error between the relative projections of the source and target domains. This process effectively expands the initial seed anchors by finding new embeddings that align well with the source domain's embeddings.\n\nThe AO method iterates this process, gradually improving the correspondence and the embeddings, until convergence. This iterative refinement allows the method to discover new parallel anchors even when the initial seed set is small, thereby reducing the reliance on a large number of parallel anchors and enabling the solution of the Limited Correspondence Problem (LCP) in scenarios where obtaining a full set of parallel anchors is impractical.","source":"data/test/2406.11014.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[78,77,79,47,13,15,19,60,105,41,57,48,67,101,95,63,85,62,54,114,58,25,55,75,102,46,109,34,74,103,3,70,29,9,71,118,53,125,130,97,104,84,91,127,35,36,96,117,107,11,32,39,20,45,69,115,128,17,33,49,124,126,18,51,94,121,72,123,132,59,61,76,52,87,113,131,56,30,50,73,8,31,120,129,112,133,16,21,26,122,40,42,83,134,22,43,93,110,119,106,4,6,10,12,14,24,28,38,44,64,66,68,80,82,88,90,92,98,100,1,86,116,7,5,99,108,89,111,27,37,81,2,65,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

MLPs can capture more complex relationships between features, potentially leading to improved performance when stitching models across different domains.\n\n3. The ability to use MLPs with different activation functions (cosine, ReLU, tanh) allows for more flexibility in modeling the data.\n\nLimitations:\n1. The underlying mechanisms for MLPs' improved performance are not fully understood, making it difficult to generalize these findings.\n\n2. MLPs may be more prone to overfitting compared to SVMs, especially with limited data.\n\n3. The increased complexity of MLPs could make them harder to interpret compared to the more straightforward SVMs.\n\n4. The specific choice of activation function (cosine, ReLU, tanh) may impact performance, requiring careful tuning.\n\n5. While MLPs show scale invariance, this may not always translate to improved cross-modal performance.\n\n6. The additional computational cost of training MLPs compared to SVMs could be a drawback in some scenarios.\n\nOverall, MLPs offer potential benefits in leveraging cross-modal information, but their effectiveness and interpretability require further investigation.","source":"data/test/2406.11014.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[113,61,118,76,75,114,83,17,34,59,94,51,95,97,11,116,30,84,18,32,46,77,43,62,125,54,87,26,3,31,117,49,56,105,124,16,25,91,103,8,39,67,74,121,93,127,72,52,53,123,29,50,73,15,33,41,85,128,133,35,60,63,70,96,131,36,115,42,57,111,132,58,101,119,130,129,5,20,21,69,9,122,78,102,104,13,40,109,7,79,110,19,45,47,86,126,55,120,48,71,22,106,108,4,6,10,12,14,24,28,38,44,64,66,68,80,82,88,90,92,98,100,27,112,134,1,107,89,81,65,37,99,2,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How does varying the prompt size (g) from 1 to 3 impact the understandability and relevance of prompts generated through Directed Diversity, and what trade-offs do these effects suggest for message ideation?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[41],"raw_output":"","pred":"Varying the prompt size (g) from 1 to 3 impacts the understandability and relevance of prompts generated through Directed Diversity in distinct ways. With a prompt size of 1 (g = 1), the prompts are more concise and focused, which can lead to higher understandability and relevance. This is because the single phrase provides a clear and direct starting point for ideation, making it easier for ideators to grasp the intended message and relate it to their own ideas. However, this simplicity can also limit the depth and breadth of the ideation process, potentially hindering the generation of more complex and nuanced ideas.\n\nAs the prompt size increases to 3 (g = 3), the prompts become more detailed and context-rich, which can enhance the ideation process by providing more information and context. This can lead to more diverse and creative ideations, as ideators have more to work with. However, this increased detail can also introduce complexity, making the prompts harder to understand and adopt. The trade-off here is that while larger prompts can stimulate more varied and original ideas, they may require more cognitive effort to process and integrate into the ideation process.\n\nIn summary, smaller prompts (g = 1) are easier to understand and adopt but may limit ideation depth, while larger prompts (g = 3) promote more creativity but demand higher cognitive effort.

This removed a significant portion of the Ethereum mining capacity from the network.\n\n2. **Market Dynamics**: The Ethereum network experienced a period of high demand for mining, likely driven by the rise in Ethereum's price and the increasing popularity of Ethereum-based applications and DeFi protocols. This high demand led to a scramble for mining capacity, resulting in a more concentrated distribution of hash rate shares among the remaining mining pools.\n\n3. **Market Consolidation**: The market consolidation in the Ethereum mining industry, where a few large mining pools (like Ethermine, F2Pool, Hiveon, Poolin, and 2Miners) gained a larger share of the hash rate, indicates a shift towards more centralized control. This consolidation could be driven by economies of scale, improved efficiency, and strategic partnerships.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements**: Advances in mining hardware and software, such as the transition to the Ethash algorithm and the adoption of more efficient mining hardware, might have contributed to the increased hash rate capacity of certain pools.\n\n5. **Economic Incentives**: The economic incentives for mining, including the rewards from mining and the potential for higher profitability, likely attracted more miners to these larger, more efficient pools.\n\nThese factors collectively led to a more concentrated distribution of hash rate shares among the remaining major mining pools.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[72,125,19,127,124,126,71,45,119,22,60,75,20,77,49,62,129,44,58,82,14,28,17,18,120,46,63,121,85,92,93,53,83,37,15,48,16,118,6,57,122,99,133,30,47,73,95,96,101,104,81,84,29,59,78,80,94,52,98,131,79,141,110,130,134,43,76,89,100,103,105,147,65,90,113,91,33,51,21,128,148,25,27,144,24,123,136,142,145,35,66,132,23,50,68,109,143,149,74,88,32,61,140,41,55,97,114,137,31,7,34,108,111,4,5,115,64,87,102,135,139,150,70,36,69,54,106,107,13,39,116,146,151,9,67,11,112,138,56,12,26,42,40,86,38,1,2,3,10,8,117],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What can be inferred about the relationship between the rate of transaction issuance and the rate of block mining in the Bitcoin blockchain, and how does this relate to the concept of contention transparency?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[37],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between the rate of transaction issuance and the rate of block mining in the Bitcoin blockchain, as depicted in Figure 2.2(a), shows that transaction issuance has been significantly higher than the rate at which blocks are mined. Specifically, 50% of all Bitcoin transactions were added to the blockchain in just 3 years, indicating a high volume of transactions being issued. However, the rate of block mining is much slower, with only 50% of blocks mined in the same period. This disparity suggests that the blockchain is experiencing high congestion, where the number of transactions waiting to be included in blocks far exceeds the capacity of miners to process and confirm them.\n\nThis high rate of transaction issuance, combined with the slower rate of block mining, challenges the concept of contention transparency. Contention transparency assumes that all transactions are publicly broadcasted and that miners have a uniform view of the available transactions at any given time. However, in the Bitcoin blockchain, not all transactions are publicly visible. Users can submit transactions to private channels or mining pools, which are not accessible to the public. This私下提交的交易在被确认为区块的一部分之前是私有的，直到它们被永久添加到区块链中。这种不透明的交易提交方式破坏了 contention transparency 的假设，使得用户难以准确估计交易的优先级和费用，因为这些信息在交易被确认前是不可见的。","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,109,34,29,107,13,14,48,69,82,49,73,127,113,126,25,125,64,76,145,71,85,6,114,70,75,108,116,26,63,83,124,32,47,12,16,27,46,72,11,68,19,87,15,21,66,28,38,78,84,123,24,51,118,42,50,60,112,120,33,77,36,122,22,79,20,52,111,17,53,90,99,147,43,74,45,58,104,106,110,121,115,119,4,57,44,86,30,55,62,91,5,54,65,130,39,88,41,67,81,139,93,35,96,98,143,56,59,80,136,146,94,142,149,95,144,105,135,89,141,97,129,103,131,40,61,101,148,92,102,18,150,31,140,7,138,100,137,151,133,128,134,23,132,1,9,117,2,3,8,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As the Mempool congestion increases, the average transaction fee rate also increases. This correlation is evident from the data presented in Figure 3.3c, which shows that higher congestion levels are associated with higher fee rates. The fee rates are strictly higher for higher congestion levels, indicating that users are willing to pay more to ensure their transactions are prioritized and included in blocks more quickly.\n\nUsers employ several strategies to mitigate delays during high congestion periods. One common strategy is to increase the transaction fee rate. By offering higher fees, users incentivize miners to prioritize their transactions, thereby reducing the commit delays. This approach is supported by the empirical evidence shown in Figure 3.4, which demonstrates that transactions with higher fee rates experience shorter commit delays. Additionally, users may adjust their transaction sizes or times to avoid periods of high congestion, ensuring that their transactions are more likely to be included in blocks promptly. These strategies help users manage their transaction priorities and reduce the time it takes for their transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[120,49,50,47,48,19,119,16,29,118,121,13,38,46,51,36,37,83,114,62,76,112,122,84,73,63,64,45,108,28,15,25,26,27,109,35,14,53,125,22,106,116,42,54,33,43,52,68,102,32,82,87,58,21,85,148,74,90,103,59,65,149,6,57,110,113,20,44,55,56,145,18,96,99,143,69,88,17,104,107,5,34,71,92,111,126,12,77,134,60,75,127,89,31,98,79,97,101,132,146,30,39,78,139,41,93,72,115,130,70,147,66,4,11,40,124,67,81,86,95,80,133,24,144,151,61,94,131,91,129,137,138,100,136,141,128,150,142,105,135,140,2,9,123,10,23,7,8,1,117,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This opacity complicates the straightforward calculation of transaction fees and the assessment of their fairness.\n\nThe potential for fee manipulation and the lack of transparency in transaction values can exacerbate issues related to fee opacity and fairness. Miners, who are incentivized to maximize their profits, may strategically prioritize transactions with higher fees or those that are less transparent, potentially leading to unfair advantages for certain users. This can result in a skewed distribution of transaction fees, where some users pay disproportionately higher fees than others, undermining the principle of fairness in the blockchain system.

This is particularly relevant in scenarios where the input alphabet includes individual atoms that need to be processed multiple times.\n\n2. **List Duplication**: copyX* duplicates entire lists of atoms, which is crucial for operations that involve processing multiple instances of a list. This is essential for tasks that require repeated processing of sequences of atoms, such as in list transformations or when dealing with nested structures.\n\n3. **Flexibility**: The ability to copy both atoms and lists separately provides flexibility in regular list functions. This allows for more nuanced manipulation of input data, where some parts of the input might need individual atom duplication while others might require list duplication.\n\n4. **Complexity Handling**: In regular list functions, the distinction between atom and list duplication can affect the complexity of algorithms and the efficiency of operations. For instance, algorithms that rely on list duplication might need to be optimized differently than those that focus on atom duplication.\n\nOverall, this difference enables regular list functions to handle both simple atom manipulations and more complex list operations, making them a versatile tool in computational tasks involving lists with atoms.","source":"data/test/2406.18934.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[183,59,64,181,65,66,213,210,211,39,61,63,75,76,41,70,198,204,81,97,98,2,68,90,128,131,182,23,87,40,169,179,62,188,80,127,154,26,148,19,60,74,109,159,171,67,120,212,124,126,184,208,209,28,77,89,161,195,205,25,71,100,114,170,95,173,58,69,96,143,202,103,152,178,180,201,203,24,32,38,78,84,108,125,189,54,56,73,82,172,197,207,12,31,47,79,116,119,123,130,149,156,157,11,36,42,72,88,99,122,138,147,151,177,193,27,105,187,217,3,21,164,194,206,20,22,30,86,104,135,33,136,142,168,191,214,4,14,115,117,132,165,185,215,216,8,53,57,83,121,144,34,44,101,111,150,167,192,13,18,106,129,155,166,15,55,137,146,160,162,176,102,153,174,175,196,199,112,113,141,93,107,186,94,118,7,35,43,91,190,46,48,51,85,92,134,133,10,37,140,158,200,219,1,5,139,110,17,50,218,16,29,145,163,6,45,9,49,52,220],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What is the relationship between future independence in local rational semigroup transductions and the locality equation, and how does this relationship facilitate the transformation between local semigroup transductions and local rational semigroup transductions?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[156],"raw_output":"","pred":"Future independence in local rational semigroup transductions is equivalent to the locality equation. This equivalence is crucial because it allows for the transformation between local semigroup transductions and local rational semigroup transductions. Specifically, the future independence property ensures that the output of a transduction does not depend on future input letters, which is a key aspect of the locality equation. \n\nThe locality equation restricts the behavior of the transduction function \\( \\lambda \\) to ensure that it only depends on the current input and output letters, without considering future elements. This restriction is essential for maintaining the single-use property of the transduction, meaning that the transduction function can only be applied once to each input word.\n\nBy leveraging the future independence property, we can construct a local rational semigroup transduction from a local semigroup transduction. This is achieved by defining a new output function \\( \\lambda' \\) that respects the future independence, ensuring that the locality equation is satisfied. Conversely, to transform a local rational semigroup transduction into a local semigroup transduction, we introduce a new semigroup \\( S' \\) that tracks the last letter of the input word, along with a modified homomorphism \\( h' \\) and output function \\( \\lambda' \\). This transformation maintains the single-use property and ensures that the locality equation is upheld, thus facilitating the equivalence between the two types of transductions.","source":"data/test/2406.18934.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[156,155,132,167,106,215,150,149,146,153,157,105,103,172,3,154,169,152,183,173,210,102,109,104,151,107,23,100,11,214,135,168,189,101,182,80,147,188,82,211,218,99,141,185,21,176,133,216,20,13,65,123,166,174,24,32,171,196,212,25,35,46,111,116,14,92,4,19,219,88,186,2,12,28,217,89,91,93,114,125,140,170,36,142,175,179,31,203,213,9,160,124,128,138,187,66,139,194,201,26,39,184,41,45,112,159,206,34,69,97,113,22,59,117,120,220,18,122,148,207,33,83,87,90,127,181,47,67,27,37,49,161,180,48,158,38,61,63,71,98,115,129,40,86,134,143,204,30,94,119,126,200,205,64,68,85,110,121,178,197,208,42,50,62,136,60,77,198,209,51,162,56,57,70,131,164,202,6,54,74,79,96,16,78,81,177,190,75,84,137,144,193,76,130,199,44,165,10,163,1,95,145,43,195,52,58,73,8,15,191,55,29,72,192,7,108,118,5,53,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow does the concept of orbit-finiteness relate to classical finiteness, and what implications does this have for sets with atoms? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[25],"raw_output":"","pred":"The concept of orbit-finiteness relates to classical finiteness in a nuanced way for sets with atoms. While classical finiteness is preserved under finite powersets and function spaces, orbit finiteness is not. This means that sets with atoms can be orbit-finite even if their classical counterparts are infinite.\n\nFor example, consider the set of all atoms A. This set is finite in the classical sense, but it is also orbit-finite. This is because there is only one orbit, corresponding to the single atom.\n\nHowever, when considering tuples of atoms, the situation changes. The set Ak of k-tuples of atoms is orbit-finite, but the number of orbits grows very large as k increases. This illustrates that orbit finiteness can capture a notion of \"finite up to permutations\" that is not captured by classical finiteness.\n\nThe key implication is that results from finite automata theory that rely on classical finiteness may not hold for infinite alphabets. For instance, the example given shows that a semigroup transduction over an orbit-finite alphabet can be implemented using a single-use Mealy machine, even though the alphabet itself is infinite.\n\nThis highlights that while orbit finiteness is a useful concept for infinite alphabets, it requires careful consideration when applying classical results from finite automata theory.","source":"data/test/2406.18934.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[26,25,102,215,116,66,51,59,28,88,52,94,34,49,85,173,29,70,119,46,48,86,103,27,110,152,153,44,100,60,3,129,10,65,89,115,53,105,41,45,84,2,124,128,30,43,79,76,114,126,159,182,123,99,220,15,35,11,193,64,90,97,20,23,36,138,37,157,175,185,31,68,21,132,187,127,137,184,183,58,80,146,147,149,181,67,139,71,112,177,69,83,120,24,50,208,216,22,148,96,205,151,219,77,179,217,61,155,98,178,214,39,95,204,125,140,154,9,12,33,38,172,211,101,218,13,170,47,87,93,180,156,176,32,54,111,130,189,210,160,171,117,141,162,7,91,122,150,209,40,16,161,113,212,78,121,191,207,14,57,158,166,168,213,104,134,135,163,164,92,131,169,62,142,107,109,196,81,145,165,194,203,19,42,63,8,167,186,202,6,56,82,106,144,199,198,1,133,190,17,174,195,201,4,108,143,197,18,5,74,136,192,200,72,188,206,55,75,118,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Given the error analysis results, what inherent limitations of meter identification systems might lead to undetected errors in Sanskrit texts, even with a high error tolerance rate?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[175],"raw_output":"","pred":"The error analysis reveals several inherent limitations of meter identification systems that can lead to undetected errors in Sanskrit texts, even with high error tolerance rates. Firstly, the system's reliance on exact pāda matching can result in incorrect identification when there is a single error in a pāda, even if the majority of pādas are correct. This is evident from the example where a single error in a pāda leads to the overall meter being reported as 'unknown'. Secondly, the system lacks a suggestion mechanism for corrections, which can hinder the user's ability to identify and rectify errors effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the system's inability to handle partial verses or single pādas limits its applicability to real-world scenarios where text may not always be perfectly formatted. This restricts its utility in practical applications, such as digitization and error correction of digital corpora. Furthermore, the system's focus on fuzzy matching, while useful for error tolerance, may not always identify the correct chanda, especially when the errors are subtle or the text is highly corrupted.\n\nThese limitations highlight the need for more robust error correction mechanisms that can handle both exact and approximate matches, as well as provide clear suggestions for corrections.","source":"data/test/2406.18276.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,175,26,157,156,154,166,174,22,172,49,171,9,44,81,155,74,80,201,107,37,73,153,193,194,108,158,159,173,29,48,78,104,103,169,18,75,162,163,77,25,56,72,76,95,167,202,33,149,195,71,119,164,203,41,79,84,100,39,53,59,83,170,34,28,35,192,58,200,8,43,60,62,147,165,204,32,57,96,36,141,10,19,42,47,54,105,123,124,161,180,52,70,140,51,55,109,7,40,45,64,85,115,185,186,92,118,82,184,143,148,177,190,3,23,46,97,101,138,20,111,120,125,129,191,98,130,160,1,65,66,112,127,181,199,106,122,27,61,68,113,151,197,198,114,150,152,178,179,5,12,17,88,126,133,189,67,131,182,183,137,142,15,69,187,99,102,117,139,145,146,188,136,110,89,134,31,63,121,21,144,86,116,87,132,93,90,38,168,94,91,13,135,11,14,2,4,6,16,24,30,50,128,196],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This hierarchical structure is crucial for understanding the concept of d-disorder, which deals with the relative uncertainty of distributions relative to a reference distribution d.\n\nIn the context of d-majorization, this arrangement helps illustrate that distributions can be ordered in a way that reflects their proximity to the reference distribution d.

This visualization aids in grasping the complex relationships between distributions and their relative positions in the space of all possible distributions.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[80,284,283,285,257,279,277,278,276,79,286,244,282,54,189,280,242,248,288,287,211,266,64,281,336,61,81,292,13,59,95,116,256,222,289,78,339,77,252,320,49,263,48,71,76,117,118,268,245,2,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,18,22,32,45,46,60,84,110,128,142,144,233,240,55,82,138,186,208,178,231,265,267,291,63,146,205,249,68,132,62,73,114,272,299,56,58,154,158,273,52,53,74,103,212,258,214,333,161,183,29,67,75,121,199,216,269,21,34,125,348,353,72,85,93,119,218,355,362,66,213,89,113,134,148,290,309,43,123,177,217,243,255,19,127,135,137,206,226,262,369,26,129,179,190,201,228,229,334,6,27,30,105,295,335,337,344,57,195,200,41,102,225,342,343,347,363,31,96,207,215,327,24,50,108,175,181,191,39,94,126,236,261,130,139,197,210,301,302,326,361,38,51,112,140,149,159,264,151,324,331,37,104,162,163,193,198,224,322,40,107,184,204,230,232,234,235,247,294,303,92,120,136,152,188,315,316,332,341,28,69,221,296,298,346,5,97,124,131,237,250,253,328,35,223,260,349,367,9,164,270,319,321,330,352,360,368,14,20,165,172,318,345,356,358,25,36,99,338,340,42,47,122,170,173,185,238,297,311,351,169,251,300,305,325,350,1,70,91,171,271,354,90,100,275,98,155,192,307,310,147,153,160,219,259,304,359,88,133,166,209,246,317,293,323,101,141,176,182,227,308,312,115,220,241,314,10,106,33,86,167,187,254,23,87,150,180,313,194,196,329,65,370,44,83,357,111,157,168,174,145,274,202,366,156,203,17,364,239,306,365,3,109,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

A preorder is Debreu separable if there exists a countable subset \\( Z \\subseteq X \\) such that \\( Z \\) is Debreu dense.  Upper separability requires a countable subset \\( Z \\subseteq X \\) that is both order dense and upper dense.\n\nWhile Debreu separability implies the existence of a countable subset \\( Z \\) that is Debreu dense, it does not guarantee that \\( Z \\) is upper dense.  Therefore, a preorder can be Debreu separable without being upper separable.\n\nFor example, consider the preorder \\( (X, \\preceq) \\) on the set \\( X = \\mathbb{R} \\) where \\( \\preceq \\) is defined as \\( x \\preceq y \\) if and only if \\( x \\leq y \\) and \\( x \\neq y \\). This preorder is Debreu separable because the set of all rational numbers \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is a countable subset that is Debreu dense (every pair of elements is comparable). However, \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is not upper dense because there exist incomparable elements (e.g., \\( 0 \\) and \\( 1 \\)) for which no element in \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) lies between them.

Iterative refinement allows the method to iteratively improve the estimated pose by refining the alignment between the predicted pointcloud and the observed depth map.\n\n2. The point-to-plane ICP algorithm is a well-established technique for pose estimation, providing a robust way to refine the initial pose estimate.\n\n3.

{"question":"How might the limitations of grid-based representations in 3D object reconstruction, particularly concerning time and memory efficiency, be addressed using alternative data structures, and what advantages might these alternatives offer in practical applications?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[82],"raw_output":"","pred":"Grid-based representations in 3D object reconstruction suffer from high time and memory requirements due to the need for expensive Marching Cubes computations at every optimization step.  This makes them impractical for real-time applications and large-scale datasets.  Alternative data structures, such as octrees, offer significant improvements in efficiency.  Octrees allow for hierarchical partitioning of space, enabling faster access to relevant data and reducing the computational load.  This results in faster rendering times and lower memory usage, making real-time 3D reconstruction feasible.\n\nThe advantages of octree-based representations are particularly evident in practical applications.  In real-time simulations for embodied AI, the ability to quickly render and manipulate 3D environments is crucial for training agents.  Octrees enable efficient scene representation and manipulation, allowing agents to navigate and interact with their environment in real-time.  This is essential for tasks like collision avoidance, path planning, and dynamic modeling, which are fundamental to the development of autonomous systems.

Its primary function is to extract a shared secret from the inputs \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which are derived from the shared secret \\(W\\) and the local sources of randomness \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Specifically, 2NMExt takes the concatenation of \\(A\\) and \\(B'\\) (where \\(B'\\) is a tampered version of \\(B\\)) and \\(W\\) as inputs. This function is designed to produce a shared secret \\(R\\) that is resilient to tampering by an active adversary.\n\nThe protocol ensures the security of the shared secret by employing a two-step verification process. First, Alice and Bob exchange \\(R\\) and split it into three parts. They then verify that these parts match, which helps in detecting any tampering. If the verification fails, the protocol aborts, ensuring that the shared secret is not compromised. If the verification succeeds, the remaining part of \\(R\\) is used as the shared secret, which is guaranteed to be uniform and unknown to the adversary.\n\nThe 2NMExt function's robustness against tampering is achieved by its design, which ensures that even if one of the sources is tampered with, the shared secret remains secure. This is particularly important in scenarios where an adversary can tamper with the memory of one party, as it prevents the adversary from gaining any useful information about the shared secret.

Specifically, the weight $w$ is set to $w_{h2} := 1/\\alpha_R x - \\gamma$, ensuring that the warning levels are significantly increased compared to the original enhanced WM (eh-WM).

In contrast, for FMNIST data, the distribution is shifted to the left, with a mean of 0.94, indicating that the test data points are less aligned with the training gradient space.

The leftward shift in the distribution for FMNIST data suggests that the model's predictions for out-of-distribution data are more likely to be orthogonal to the training gradient space. This orthogonality can be leveraged to identify OOD data points, as they are less likely to follow the learned patterns of the training data. By analyzing the gradients and their projections, one can detect when the model's predictions deviate significantly from the training data, which is a key indicator of OOD data. This approach can enhance the robustness of the model by improving its ability to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, thereby reducing false positives and false negatives in OOD detection.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[128,13,145,129,119,120,161,118,122,91,194,55,110,111,78,186,183,80,138,83,168,131,170,84,136,172,81,113,189,171,177,41,191,182,10,68,132,190,154,178,185,9,43,70,127,69,139,7,16,112,181,5,121,133,79,85,166,49,72,142,149,160,174,73,62,77,82,105,54,143,103,11,123,90,115,14,38,59,74,76,134,21,42,155,179,130,109,137,6,108,33,44,86,107,51,32,46,58,114,18,57,97,167,37,63,4,56,61,65,71,93,47,141,146,173,188,60,184,22,40,89,101,117,144,148,12,39,88,157,95,102,126,140,20,29,176,192,96,106,124,153,193,26,92,135,158,31,52,125,180,15,24,75,87,98,165,8,67,175,27,28,94,195,50,169,30,156,36,99,104,187,45,23,25,48,66,17,164,64,151,152,53,100,35,150,116,34,147,1,2,162,163,159,19,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The model's limitations highlight the complexity of visual understanding and the need for further advancements in visual representation and reasoning.","source":"data/test/2405.16728.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[121,122,112,119,14,64,117,16,114,102,138,103,115,118,10,140,143,151,163,48,109,158,116,111,144,75,91,137,92,105,139,141,142,76,157,22,107,108,2,63,93,120,77,128,84,136,167,171,23,87,149,106,15,101,161,162,20,104,26,61,78,86,100,155,165,62,97,5,21,135,125,129,147,13,74,94,34,54,47,58,65,81,85,90,96,195,56,164,172,153,9,28,72,79,95,110,148,199,46,66,80,89,113,127,150,160,30,31,27,82,152,154,38,60,73,186,123,156,178,41,83,99,184,188,49,53,196,4,12,40,98,134,185,193,68,176,19,173,197,198,35,55,69,71,130,177,182,6,51,52,194,200,1,88,133,11,33,45,59,189,18,126,57,132,145,183,24,67,131,70,187,36,168,190,146,159,179,192,8,42,7,29,32,174,3,170,37,50,124,39,191,25,175,43,166,180,181,17,169,44],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This multi-task capability allows for more efficient use of computational resources compared to specialized models for each task. The ability to generate high-quality videos at 37 fps on a V100 GPU and 0.25 seconds on a TPUv4i highlights a major improvement in speed and efficiency.\n\n2.

After around 10-20 iterations, the residual values stabilize at a very low level, suggesting the algorithm has reached a good solution.\n\n3.

However, this comes at the cost of increased tracking error and acceleration.\n\nSpecifically:\n- At a batch size of 1000, the tracking error is 3.06 meters with a maximum of 4.65 meters and a minimum of 1.56 meters.\n- The acceleration is 0.166 m/s² with a maximum of 0.31 m/s² and a minimum of 0.03 m/s².\n\nWhile the success rate reaches 100%, the tracking error and acceleration metrics indicate that the trajectories are becoming less precise and smoother, respectively. This suggests that the optimizer is taking longer detours to avoid collisions, which increases the overall path length and smoothness cost.\n\nThe trend implies that beyond a certain point, increasing the batch size does not significantly improve performance metrics like success rate, but rather leads to suboptimal trajectories with higher error and acceleration.

For a batch size of 200, the GPU computation time is 0.0017 seconds, while the CPU computation time is 0.075 seconds. For a batch size of 600, the GPU computation time is 0.0026 seconds, and the CPU computation time is 0.12 seconds. This indicates that the GPU implementation is approximately 44 times faster than the CPU for a batch size of 200 and 46 times faster for a batch size of 600.\n\nThe implications for choosing one over the other are substantial. The GPU implementation offers a much higher throughput and efficiency, making it more suitable for large-scale batch sizes and environments with high computational demands. This scalability is crucial for applications requiring real-time or near-real-time processing, such as autonomous navigation or robotics control, where minimizing computation time is essential for responsiveness and efficiency.\n\nHowever, the CPU implementation, while slower, still provides a competitive performance, especially for smaller batch sizes. The resource competition in the CPU implementation, where each problem instantiation competes for computational resources, can lead to a slowdown as the batch size increases. This competition can be mitigated by running sequential instantiations with mini-batches, as observed in the experiments where the CPU computation time for a batch size of 6 increased to 0.03 seconds.\n\nIn summary, for applications requiring high scalability and efficiency, the GPU implementation is preferred, whereas the CPU implementation offers a more straightforward and potentially cost-effective solution for smaller batch sizes.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[67,75,66,12,94,90,93,48,10,55,56,65,82,19,81,91,46,86,11,6,92,95,52,77,83,50,18,64,98,44,38,49,32,34,54,70,104,53,76,30,57,14,85,20,43,63,35,36,87,96,47,29,69,100,37,60,61,78,101,8,42,26,79,107,33,88,106,15,45,102,103,72,105,25,89,31,17,7,71,80,59,2,27,68,24,28,16,84,41,62,99,73,13,39,58,74,109,23,112,40,4,111,97,110,22,51,108,21,3,1,9,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is crucial in big data environments where handling vast volumes of data can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nHowever, solely relying on the \"Ease of Manipulation\" metric for evaluating data quality in a big data environment has potential drawbacks. This metric primarily measures the simplicity of data preparation but does not account for other critical aspects of data quality, such as accuracy, completeness, and relevance. Ignoring these dimensions can lead to overlooking significant issues that might affect the overall quality and utility of the data. For instance, a dataset might be easily manipulated but still contain inaccuracies or missing information, which could compromise the reliability and validity of the data. Therefore, while \"Ease of Manipulation\" is a valuable metric, it should be complemented by other quality metrics to ensure a comprehensive assessment of data quality.","source":"data/test/2405.03870.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[73,63,80,68,27,70,79,81,12,140,66,36,52,72,2,54,59,84,28,38,147,67,19,120,148,29,47,49,55,32,30,48,71,43,58,102,115,121,136,144,60,61,37,44,10,93,138,11,56,90,91,40,146,98,117,34,53,118,126,9,21,50,65,141,35,41,64,127,8,105,124,130,131,83,92,96,139,31,75,77,87,88,57,85,97,114,119,128,62,95,113,122,125,135,142,152,22,42,82,106,111,116,137,20,143,24,45,110,150,5,18,101,132,145,13,26,99,15,25,39,46,109,94,151,78,100,107,23,86,104,14,1,133,103,108,4,51,7,123,134,149,16,33,89,112,17,129,74,153,6,69,76,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The squares are clearly visible, and the MSCEqF trajectory maintains a consistent path, with only minor deviations. The alignment between the two trajectories is evident, indicating that the MSCEqF is able to accurately estimate the position and orientation of the aerial platform.\n\nWhile there are some minor discrepancies, such as slight deviations in the z-axis in the 3D view, the overall accuracy and shape of the trajectory are maintained. The MSCEqF demonstrates robust performance in estimating the aerial platform's movement, closely mirroring the ground truth data.","source":"data/test/2407.14297v1.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[153,148,14,150,151,158,145,9,15,146,133,143,160,11,152,154,16,24,149,172,22,157,147,74,111,126,142,6,110,131,114,72,77,113,125,13,76,116,94,107,127,132,78,141,161,75,112,128,8,60,96,130,139,105,166,71,73,118,156,82,83,98,62,102,117,23,50,103,108,59,91,180,173,51,85,129,134,19,20,55,67,86,106,5,93,121,175,92,162,170,68,87,97,101,58,63,79,89,124,36,52,70,104,177,54,64,10,115,120,135,144,45,84,123,138,174,21,29,61,39,155,176,38,57,69,122,168,171,136,163,17,47,119,159,1,7,18,53,65,109,178,179,28,34,43,80,3,44,66,137,164,26,90,167,12,41,99,140,31,33,35,56,165,27,46,100,25,169,2,81,95,40,48,4,37,88,49,32,30,42],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As the temperature increases, the filament's color darkens, indicating that the wood particles burn more intensely. This results in a darker finish on the printed object. The figure illustrates this effect by showing a sphere printed at three different temperatures: 200°C, 230°C, and 250°C. At 200°C, the sphere has a lighter, more natural color, while at 250°C, the color is much darker, almost black.\n\nThis temperature variation has important implications for the identification and verification of 3D printed objects. Since the color of the object changes with temperature, it can be used as a unique identifier. By printing multiple instances of an object at different temperatures, each instance will have a distinct appearance, making it easier to distinguish between them. This method can be particularly useful for businesses to verify the authenticity of printed objects. For instance, a business can print an object at a specific temperature and then use the resulting color variation to confirm that the object was indeed printed using the correct settings. This ensures that the object is genuine and has not been tampered with, thereby enhancing the security and integrity of the printed products.","source":"data/test/2407.11748.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[110,111,92,97,106,109,93,17,30,31,108,112,96,18,10,134,137,136,95,153,91,102,107,138,98,152,99,29,119,143,104,105,15,151,100,130,118,128,148,13,117,141,145,147,127,60,103,37,115,9,53,101,121,156,135,77,81,146,27,54,28,46,114,7,65,149,8,57,142,11,68,78,82,59,94,140,20,73,79,169,19,85,55,113,139,61,133,159,51,84,172,21,32,36,43,124,131,76,120,167,42,66,122,154,24,88,90,126,155,178,129,175,39,16,116,161,63,125,144,150,74,171,14,52,157,166,173,26,34,40,22,132,170,2,64,80,160,25,158,49,87,165,177,12,45,48,23,62,70,71,164,75,35,38,47,69,83,86,72,3,56,89,44,50,168,41,58,123,176,162,163,5,67,33,1,174,179,4,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Additionally, there is a concern about the misuse of hazardous materials, which can lead to health issues and environmental damage.\n\nTo address these concerns, the literature suggests several strategies. Firstly, implementing robust safety protocols and training programs for users is crucial. This includes educating users on the proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials and the safe operation of equipment. Secondly, integrating automated safety features into the makerspace infrastructure can help prevent accidents and fires. For instance, using sensors to detect hazardous materials and automatically adjusting settings can mitigate risks. Lastly, promoting a culture of safety awareness among users is essential, ensuring that everyone understands the importance of adhering to safety guidelines and the potential consequences of non-compliance. By combining these approaches, makerspaces can enhance safety and reduce health risks associated with their use.","source":"data/test/2407.11748.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[45,168,43,41,158,157,164,171,56,174,65,170,32,50,152,36,155,7,177,133,156,159,44,27,55,64,12,15,28,31,37,163,88,151,153,67,113,134,14,147,4,51,11,130,19,42,16,146,172,13,109,24,111,139,169,20,18,47,63,30,23,175,26,135,8,87,100,145,53,62,82,101,89,107,126,3,35,110,49,173,25,176,165,167,112,166,60,118,119,128,161,179,66,108,68,78,178,75,148,150,69,10,91,142,61,77,129,143,39,48,90,1,22,52,2,38,80,85,125,138,160,127,29,58,81,120,137,17,93,84,131,46,114,141,144,34,40,54,136,9,76,92,70,83,149,99,5,122,140,57,117,105,97,33,59,102,71,79,103,132,96,6,115,72,116,121,124,95,154,74,98,106,104,73,162,94,123,21,86],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Each simplicial complex is associated with a \"birth\" and \"death\" time, indicating when it first appears and when it disappears as the filtration threshold changes.\n\nBarcodes and persistent diagrams are visual representations of this filtration process. Barcodes are a finite collection of intervals, where each interval corresponds to a topological feature that exists within a certain range of the filtration threshold. The length of the interval indicates the \"lifespan\" of the feature, or how long it persists before being \"filled in\" by the filtration process.

By focusing on the connectivity and similarity within cells, cell complexity can better represent the developmental trajectory and cell-cell interactions.\n\nThe potential advantages of cell complexity include:\n\n1. **Enhanced Understanding of Developmental Trajectories**: By capturing the dynamic interactions within cells, cell complexity can provide a more nuanced understanding of how cells evolve and differentiate over time.\n2. **Improved Modeling of Cell-Cell Interactions**: It allows for the identification of signaling pathways and communication networks between cells, which is crucial for understanding cellular ecology.\n3. **Better Distinction Between Time Points**: Cell complexity can offer clearer distinctions between different stages of development, aiding in the identification of critical developmental milestones.\n4. **Richer Representation of Gene Expression Patterns**: It provides a more comprehensive view of gene expression, beyond just the number of expressed genes, leading to more accurate and insightful biological interpretations.","source":"data/test/2408.11948.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[121,140,122,125,142,123,133,143,4,139,148,120,18,165,17,119,109,144,25,138,124,141,166,145,157,168,158,108,137,46,131,127,149,15,49,135,29,72,134,7,146,3,163,167,47,48,77,129,150,151,32,104,130,147,161,45,64,9,78,82,85,44,83,105,63,100,24,75,103,28,71,16,61,76,94,112,159,39,42,43,56,132,62,79,110,13,60,102,36,41,52,69,6,27,80,155,162,30,50,68,118,31,58,65,93,154,51,74,84,126,14,59,86,91,11,73,152,33,37,153,53,106,136,156,164,35,38,70,111,66,81,26,160,1,34,117,128,19,55,87,10,12,98,114,40,57,115,5,8,92,99,113,97,95,88,90,89,20,54,67,116,96,101,21,107,22,23,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

If the x-axis vector is simply [1, 0, ..., 0] (with a 1 in the first position and 0s elsewhere), its representation in the given basis is [1, 0, ..., 0].\n\nThe dot product of 'q' with this x-axis vector is calculated by multiplying corresponding components and summing the results:\n\nq · x-axis = (0 * 1) + (1/2 * 0) + (√3/2 * 0) + (0 * 0) + ... + (0 * 0) = 0\n\nThe significance of this dot product is that it indicates the angle between 'q' and the x-axis.

Conversely, for larger α values, the votes tend to cluster more closely, reflecting a higher degree of correlation among the preferences.\n\nThe mathematical upper bound for the expected number of different votes under the urn model, with the assumption that \\( n \\leq m! \\), is given by the formula \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{1+(i-1)\\alpha} \\). This formula represents the upper limit on the number of unique votes that can be generated, taking into account the level of contagion parameter α. The upper bound is derived by considering the probability of generating a new vote in each iteration, which decreases as α increases, leading to fewer unique votes. This upper bound helps in understanding the maximum diversity of votes that can be expected under the urn model for a given number of voters and candidates.","source":"data/test/2407.11889.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,96,28,97,95,36,142,55,166,156,102,120,57,169,184,100,160,146,38,144,50,66,105,170,30,98,74,167,22,117,168,33,35,123,162,53,93,103,143,165,157,11,12,104,141,151,14,34,51,71,86,140,145,164,172,27,109,148,155,59,72,29,54,132,152,189,31,21,90,92,115,133,85,114,119,9,79,161,112,187,20,61,122,126,130,65,70,116,135,43,52,88,107,13,15,45,60,75,82,154,84,128,131,134,147,186,48,56,76,91,94,118,127,179,111,137,158,192,44,150,10,42,46,67,81,159,5,171,47,39,68,125,149,16,40,49,64,78,177,183,163,32,58,121,124,153,62,69,113,3,99,19,41,191,194,2,4,17,63,190,6,7,24,25,101,110,129,182,106,138,195,139,193,197,23,136,175,89,77,87,178,26,188,18,174,176,180,1,73,185,83,173,196,80,108,181,8],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

For Sayfullina, RoBERTa outperforms JobBERT across all methods (ISO, AOC, WSE) in terms of F1-score, with WSE achieving the highest F1-score of 59.61. In contrast, for SkillSpan, JobBERT surpasses RoBERTa, with WSE again achieving the highest F1-score of 46.58.\n\nIn terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, the methods show distinct trends. For Sayfullina, WSE consistently achieves the highest precision and recall, indicating its superior ability to accurately identify and recall relevant skills. However, for SkillSpan, the performance fluctuates more significantly. WSE maintains a high F1-score, but the precision and recall for ISO and AOC are notably lower, suggesting that these methods struggle more with SkillSpan's dataset.\n\nThe differences in performance can be attributed to several factors. Sayfullina's dataset, which is more focused on soft skills, benefits from WSE's ability to capture nuanced skill expressions. SkillSpan, with its broader range of skills, presents a more challenging environment for all methods, particularly for ISO and AOC, which may struggle with the diversity and complexity of skills in this dataset. The higher F1-score for JobBERT on SkillSpan could be due to its better handling of the dataset's complexity, although the exact reasons for this trend are not explicitly detailed in the provided information.","source":"data/test/2404.18977.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[169,170,220,215,173,231,233,168,172,214,192,112,110,127,217,219,191,221,111,174,67,115,166,113,129,188,234,230,232,87,165,190,213,218,116,212,128,107,229,257,66,99,14,68,70,186,88,92,65,114,135,167,189,228,259,69,164,256,105,176,187,11,96,117,185,26,131,144,154,98,146,205,216,245,86,109,20,63,80,91,145,149,95,184,226,258,71,162,177,207,244,97,90,103,130,143,147,222,303,27,89,141,163,250,251,40,43,62,108,157,171,74,151,208,235,300,22,82,158,223,247,150,136,178,299,64,106,246,47,304,55,260,274,193,209,224,239,278,76,37,211,240,242,264,307,41,139,294,28,85,179,39,46,198,266,313,42,100,138,236,302,15,21,48,54,118,279,297,308,56,57,78,79,126,243,281,102,23,282,290,298,84,269,272,293,309,77,261,271,275,284,285,291,19,31,288,301,25,277,311,81,276,292,10,132,148,255,142,210,248,310,182,270,305,75,183,60,104,267,296,13,38,49,265,289,36,133,200,283,286,94,124,125,30,101,137,140,306,83,241,268,273,295,194,314,29,199,18,34,180,227,287,12,24,280,263,312,5,225,123,315,4,9,155,119,122,58,120,159,195,50,93,152,202,8,33,161,249,17,153,44,121,181,35,59,201,206,156,53,61,252,45,134,16,51,197,238,160,73,204,1,3,203,7,175,253,262,2,72,237,196,52,32,254,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

Specifically, these previous approaches often used domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) or off-the-shelf models tailored to individual languages. This limited their ability to handle multilingual data effectively.\n\nESCOXLM-R seeks to overcome this limitation by leveraging the ESCO taxonomy, a standardized system covering 27 languages. By incorporating ESCO data into its pre-training process, ESCOXLM-R aims to create a language-agnostic model that can perform well across multiple languages. \n\nThe study notes that previous approaches have struggled with the lack of comprehensive, open-source JAD data in various languages, making it difficult to fully pre-train language models. ESCOXLM-R addresses this by using ESCO data to provide a broader, multilingual context for pre-training.\n\nThis approach allows ESCOXLM-R to potentially generalize better across different languages compared to language-specific models. The study reports that ESCOXLM-R outperformed previous state-of-the-art models on 6 out of 9 datasets, particularly when the task was relevant to the ESCO taxonomy and context was important. This suggests ESCOXLM-R may be more effective at handling multilingual JAD tasks than previous methods.","source":"data/test/2404.18977.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[177,193,259,194,176,27,192,189,312,29,187,188,195,13,23,175,179,178,184,202,182,190,22,162,240,186,205,37,185,204,171,191,46,21,239,248,24,135,200,201,199,287,96,183,203,257,247,258,260,261,4,180,244,181,198,25,224,163,207,208,225,264,20,50,18,48,150,196,197,36,35,149,5,28,277,242,42,117,167,272,26,54,165,136,97,144,249,274,164,270,143,222,306,34,138,166,250,294,255,276,313,8,39,95,100,253,281,305,15,19,101,296,292,14,30,59,76,170,216,31,155,156,223,44,51,133,146,245,267,284,308,314,1,269,300,302,33,99,137,142,288,90,293,298,43,68,71,157,40,57,168,211,238,206,221,262,275,278,9,53,153,158,212,311,49,147,161,169,241,246,263,289,290,291,301,2,77,217,266,268,285,10,12,69,75,116,218,251,271,309,113,141,173,256,286,303,47,55,104,105,110,134,209,304,310,41,64,94,103,140,210,228,243,78,145,233,234,265,299,124,282,307,62,67,85,121,129,132,172,73,91,98,112,174,229,279,283,38,74,84,89,109,128,151,280,17,87,127,139,148,11,215,232,236,295,65,83,273,16,66,108,120,152,154,252,58,80,86,93,107,220,226,102,106,131,213,45,61,70,119,227,81,92,118,56,79,88,231,235,297,315,63,82,159,111,214,72,237,114,115,122,219,130,123,125,160,230,126,7,32,254,3,60,52,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The clustering pattern reveals several key insights:\n\n1. **Dense Regions**: The red centroids are clustered together in specific areas, indicating dense regions within the dataset. These areas likely represent high activity or significant events.\n\n2. **Sparse Regions**: The green points are more dispersed, especially in areas away from the red centroids.

A high interception rate indicates the strategy successfully prevents invasions.  Time to neutralize threats measures the speed of response, with shorter times reflecting more efficient defense.  Resource efficiency assesses how effectively resources are used to achieve these goals.\n\nTo consider long-term adaptability, the strategy's adaptability score is crucial. This measures the number of adaptations made to respond to new or evolving threats divided by the total number of threats encountered.  A higher adaptability score indicates the strategy can effectively incorporate lessons learned and adjust to changing conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the integrity of the protected area post-interception provides insight into the strategy's effectiveness in maintaining security.  A high integrity score suggests the strategy successfully contained threats despite interception efforts.\n\nFinally, the strategy's ability to maintain high interception rates and resource efficiency over time, while continuously adapting to new threats, demonstrates its overall effectiveness and long-term viability.

Event prediction allows the system to anticipate the user's actions and responses, thereby creating a more dynamic and engaging narrative. By understanding the user's intent and predicting potential outcomes, the game can adapt its storylines and challenges in real-time, making the experience more immersive and less predictable.\n\nAction model acquisition from text enables the system to learn and understand the user's actions and the context in which they occur. This capability allows for more sophisticated decision-making processes, where the game can recognize patterns in user behavior and respond accordingly. For instance, if a user frequently explores certain areas, the game can introduce more complex puzzles or challenges in those locations, enhancing the narrative's depth and complexity.\n\nTogether, these advancements can lead to more realistic character interactions, dynamic environments, and a richer, more engaging storytelling experience.

Continuous alignment involves aligning signals that are not naturally segmented, such as audio or video, where the boundaries between elements are not predefined.

Continuous warping aims to align continuous representation spaces, often using adversarial training to learn a domain-invariant representation across different modalities. For example, Hsu et al.

Figure 3.4 illustrates that high synergy values (S) coincide with large performance drops (red), indicating that the absence of Xi leads to a substantial decrease in model performance. This relationship is particularly pronounced when the uniqueness (U) value is low. When U is low, the model relies heavily on the shared information (S) between the remaining modalities and the task. The absence of Xi, which contains a significant portion of this shared information, results in a performance drop. This is because the model cannot effectively leverage the remaining shared information without Xi, leading to a degradation in performance.\n\nIn contrast, redundancy (R) values do not show a similar relationship with performance drops when a modality is missing. Figure 3.4 shows that the correlation between R and performance drops is much lower (ρ = 0.01) compared to the correlation between S and performance drops (ρ = 0.73). This indicates that redundancy, while important, does not have as significant an impact on performance drops when a modality is missing as synergy does.

After folding, the laser continues to heat and cure the traces, embedding them within the folded structure. This method allows for the creation of complex geometries with embedded electronics.\n\n2. **Cutting and Stacking Layerwise 3D Structures**: This approach leverages the pick-and-place mechanism and laser cutting to create 3D structures.

Coercivity refers to the magnetic field strength required to reverse the magnetization of a material. In the context of this experiment, the measured repulsive forces were weaker than those predicted by the cross-correlation of the matrix values. This discrepancy arises because repulsive magnetic dipoles, when brought into contact, tend to realign to an attractive equilibrium due to the low coercivity of the soft magnetic faces. \n\nSoft magnetic materials have a lower coercivity, meaning they can easily realign their magnetic orientations to achieve a more attractive state. This realignment reduces the repulsive force that would otherwise be expected based on the initial alignment of the dipoles. To account for this effect, a scaling factor of 0.09 was implemented to normalize the magnitude of the repulsive pixels to those in attraction. This adjustment helps in aligning the predicted and measured repulsive forces more closely, thereby validating the model as an accurate predictor of force between magnetically programmed faces. The normalized sum of squared differences between the measured and predicted results using this scaling factor is 0.014, indicating a good fit between the model and experimental data.","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[98,15,96,97,70,99,71,72,36,13,85,100,101,26,94,29,63,84,95,9,103,27,64,44,62,86,28,60,65,92,112,68,107,110,49,35,90,50,105,41,69,83,106,109,61,67,125,122,119,14,42,8,87,128,54,57,88,108,120,25,33,89,118,12,43,76,78,93,104,45,113,124,2,5,34,48,4,24,77,80,121,30,91,123,75,116,10,18,59,81,102,117,126,6,16,82,3,58,74,127,11,22,37,47,56,66,21,39,111,20,38,32,46,55,73,7,1,114,53,19,52,115,23,17,51,31,79,40],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The plots indicate that with smaller initialization scales, the components converge faster and more smoothly, leading to lower reconstruction errors. This is evident from the steeper descent of the reconstruction error curves for smaller initialization scales.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8x8x8x8 (order 4) tensor completion task, the rightmost plot also shows that smaller initialization scales (1e-3 and 1e-4) lead to faster convergence and lower reconstruction errors compared to a larger initialization scale (1e-2). The curves for smaller scales are more pronounced and reach lower error values more quickly.\n\nThe observed trends suggest that smaller initialization scales promote more stable and efficient convergence in the gradient descent process. This is likely due to the reduced risk of overshooting the optimal solution, which can occur with larger initialization scales. Smaller scales allow the optimization process to more finely tune the parameters, leading to better approximations of the ground truth tensor.

The figure illustrates a tensor factorization process where an input tensor is decomposed into a sum of components, each combining N vectors using the tensor product. This decomposition is analogous to a shallow network with a single hidden layer.\n\nThe 1x1 convolution operation in the figure corresponds to the locally connected linear operator in the network. This operation involves multiplying the input tensor with learnable weight matrices (W(1), ..., W(N)) to produce a set of activations. The 1x1 convolution is used here because it allows for local connections between the input and output, similar to how weights are applied in a convolutional layer.\n\nGlobal pooling follows the 1x1 convolution, which aggregates the activations across the input dimensions. In the context of tensor factorization, this pooling operation combines the activations from the 1x1 convolution to produce a single output tensor. This is analogous to the global pooling in convolutional networks, which reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.\n\nTogether, these operations mimic the non-linear transformation and pooling steps in a convolutional network. The polynomial non-linearity introduced by the global pooling layer ensures that the network is non-linear, making it a shallow non-linear convolutional network.

By simplifying the expression, the derivation arrives at:\n\nρ2(WM) ≤ 16/√2 * (|ε| + √2LM(WM))^2 / min{|z|, |z'|}²\n\nThis bound is crucial because it directly relates the effective rank to the loss function LM(WM) and the magnitudes of z and z'. \n\nTo establish a bound that holds for all loss values, the assumption is removed.

This step ensures that the upper bound for the effective rank is applicable across all possible loss scenarios.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[115,103,104,101,100,116,17,112,16,48,170,102,111,114,132,113,169,129,136,162,166,168,164,135,15,19,138,159,194,139,14,125,140,107,161,63,106,133,155,137,167,188,44,46,197,30,156,49,143,200,47,165,28,31,45,105,198,39,64,171,108,130,201,126,151,152,96,99,134,186,20,94,98,160,65,192,109,122,38,163,118,127,145,172,174,196,203,53,88,158,173,195,18,29,78,22,123,144,189,193,131,119,141,199,12,181,187,92,202,182,90,117,154,205,8,37,42,157,11,50,79,21,60,68,74,128,4,110,204,76,153,191,121,13,23,124,82,95,120,3,5,7,190,34,41,43,91,97,25,26,27,77,10,147,59,67,70,35,52,85,146,185,33,36,58,69,184,206,24,40,62,54,71,81,150,93,9,32,80,84,86,89,57,75,175,176,178,87,180,66,142,179,183,148,55,177,72,149,83,51,1,61,2,56,73,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How does the choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) influence the network's ability to model interactions between vertices, and what are the implications of using a product aggregation operator in this context?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[61],"raw_output":"","pred":"The choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) significantly influences the network's ability to model interactions between vertices. In a GNN, the AGGREGATE function combines the hidden embeddings of a vertex's neighbors to update its own hidden embedding. This aggregation process is crucial as it determines how information from neighboring vertices is integrated into the central vertex's representation. Different aggregation operators can capture different types of interactions and dependencies between vertices.\n\nFor instance, using a product aggregation operator, as defined in Equation (5.5), allows the GNN to model interactions that are polynomial in nature. This means that the network can represent functions that are products of its inputs, which can be particularly useful for capturing complex relationships between vertices. The product aggregation operator ensures that the network's output is a polynomial function of its inputs, which can be advantageous in scenarios where polynomial interactions are expected or beneficial.\n\nThe implications of using a product aggregation operator are manifold. It enables the GNN to model more sophisticated interactions, potentially leading to better performance in tasks that involve complex dependencies between vertices. However, it also restricts the network's expressiveness to polynomial functions, which might be insufficient for modeling more intricate or non-polynomial interactions. Therefore, the choice of AGGREGATE function should be guided by the specific characteristics of the data and the nature of the interactions being modeled.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,62,57,172,60,58,177,5,175,176,64,180,173,179,9,59,178,186,3,65,63,71,174,74,67,204,86,76,142,203,202,68,69,72,79,82,78,84,53,4,196,40,8,41,80,85,77,81,144,184,190,23,25,183,83,187,182,7,35,193,87,88,181,13,27,50,75,167,39,89,36,70,147,33,26,52,205,14,92,21,22,42,195,11,185,54,141,188,96,24,44,66,146,38,206,12,29,32,51,189,95,56,197,55,143,148,151,149,191,100,199,132,16,49,20,119,121,122,128,47,109,159,43,105,18,37,171,201,19,150,192,34,90,94,125,133,138,30,48,111,170,198,46,17,91,15,97,158,45,120,126,200,93,194,10,168,118,145,156,2,31,103,104,164,1,153,161,28,108,110,129,154,163,98,160,123,112,169,106,107,130,134,135,139,115,131,124,137,152,113,116,136,140,162,155,127,157,99,101,165,114,166,102,117,6,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

During the Long Rains, birds such as Kivuta mbura start making sounds, and the Ngoco bird nests along water banks. In contrast, during the Dry Season, the Thari bird flocking indicates the onset of drought. Similarly, insects like Midithu ants and croaking frogs are observed during the Long Rains, while the Mindithu moves southwards, and Ngiri starts making noise during the Dry Season.\n\nThese behaviors can be used to predict weather changes by observing the patterns and timing of these indicators. For instance, the onset of bird sounds and insect activities during the Long Rains suggests favorable weather conditions, while the flocking of birds and the movement of insects during the Dry Season indicate impending drought. By monitoring these behaviors, farmers and communities can anticipate weather patterns and adjust their agricultural practices accordingly. For example, if the Thari bird flocking is observed, it might be a good time to plant crops that can withstand drought conditions.

{"question":"What can be inferred about the relationship between the amount of training data used in EEND performance and the effectiveness of fine-tuning, considering both before and after fine-tuning scenarios?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[70],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the data presented in Figure 4.10, we can infer several key points about the relationship between the amount of training data used in EEND performance and the effectiveness of fine-tuning:\n\n1. Fine-tuning is crucial for improving performance, as shown by the significant reduction in DER (Diarization Error Rate) after fine-tuning across all training data sizes.\n\n2. The effectiveness of fine-tuning increases with more training data. For example, using 310 hours of training data before fine-tuning results in a DER of 15.99%, while after fine-tuning it drops to 8.44%. However, using 1240 hours before fine-tuning reduces the DER to 7.28%, which is comparable to using 4961 hours or 7442 hours.\n\n3. There is a clear trend that more training data allows the model to achieve better performance both before and after fine-tuning. The 1240-hour training set, while not as large as the 4961 or 7442-hour sets, still achieves a DER of 7.03% after fine-tuning, which is very close to the best performance.\n\n4. The gap between performance before and after fine-tuning is smaller with larger training datasets, indicating that fine-tuning becomes more effective as the model has more data to learn from initially.\n\n5. The 1240-hour dataset, while not the largest, demonstrates that substantial improvements can be made with a reasonable amount of data, making it a practical choice for many applications.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that while more data is beneficial, fine-tuning is a key factor in achieving high performance, and the effectiveness of fine-tuning increases with increased training data.","source":"data/test/2407.08752.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[69,94,92,11,68,73,74,70,99,55,88,101,61,93,95,98,75,110,66,46,58,103,59,71,86,76,104,67,78,2,62,96,52,54,77,89,3,65,87,51,50,113,56,100,84,4,5,48,12,127,80,90,120,91,53,21,60,126,45,47,41,102,111,122,129,34,117,10,35,36,39,18,25,44,8,27,107,32,42,112,37,125,49,23,24,83,108,38,57,114,118,131,81,97,19,31,82,124,135,14,29,109,132,137,22,33,43,72,106,26,130,85,40,79,16,105,133,134,138,13,15,121,119,123,17,20,64,128,136,115,116,30,63,28,1,7,6,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The 8 kHz model has a DER of 27.76%, while the 16 kHz model has a DER of 26.82%. This represents a difference of 0.94% in DER between the two sampling rates.\n\nThe CHiME6 dataset is described as having \"far-field conditions\" and \"very high percentages of overlapped speech\". This suggests that the recording conditions are challenging for speech separation and diarization tasks. The higher DER for the 8 kHz model could be explained by several factors:\n\n1. The 8 kHz sampling rate may not capture enough frequency information to accurately separate overlapping speech in the far-field conditions.\n\n2. The lower sampling rate may introduce more aliasing artifacts, making it harder to distinguish between speakers.\n\n3.

This structure allows for the definition of isos (isomorphic types) and pattern-matching, which are essential for ensuring reversibility in the language. The join inverse rig provides a framework that supports recursive isos and inductive data types, enabling the representation of complex data structures and operations.\n\nThe significance of this structure lies in its ability to model the language's semantics in a way that captures both the operational behavior (how the language executes) and the denotational semantics (what the language means). This dual representation is particularly important for languages that handle non-termination, as it allows for a precise connection between the two levels of abstraction.\n\nThe concept of adequacy between operational and denotational semantics is the focus of the next section.

This is essential for the overall correctness and reliability of the denotational semantics, as it prevents potential conflicts or inconsistencies that could arise from multiple interpretations of the same variable.\n\nOverall, the uniqueness of ϕ guarantees that the duplication process is both well-defined and typed correctly, which is fundamental for the robustness and correctness of the denotational semantics in the context of reversible Turing machines.","source":"data/test/2406.07216.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[150,139,136,154,132,31,140,148,166,131,129,138,80,116,162,106,134,151,113,137,149,167,43,120,141,38,40,42,82,143,95,165,169,100,110,115,133,163,164,84,168,39,41,44,47,83,98,108,109,111,112,118,147,27,79,81,142,145,121,161,37,97,107,26,29,36,61,68,96,104,130,30,63,102,105,49,67,75,119,144,155,45,60,74,101,135,152,46,59,66,153,28,77,78,128,50,71,93,114,160,32,35,51,94,33,34,70,73,146,158,99,58,117,21,53,91,159,52,22,90,57,76,11,72,122,25,62,126,64,85,178,16,56,92,174,10,23,69,15,175,65,180,9,157,183,127,176,177,17,182,184,20,89,156,88,125,18,24,55,103,13,14,48,181,5,173,179,171,87,1,172,2,19,7,123,3,6,4,8,12,54,86,124,170],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Eq. (4.1) checks if the path can still be considered taut by ensuring the cross product of vS (the vector from x to xS) and vSS (the vector from xS to xSS) is negative.  If this condition is met, the path remains taut, and xS is not pruned.  Figure 4.2b shows a similar scenario for a target turning point at xT.  Eq.

Figure 4.2c demonstrates this issue.  If the path walks around a non-convex obstacle, vS can rotate by more than half a round with respect to vSS, causing Eq. (4.1) to break down.

Ey links, on the other hand, are associated with T-tree nodes and represent visibility from the goal point to the start point.

The key difference lies in the symmetry and the structure of the translations considered.\n\nThe significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9 is crucial for establishing the equivariance properties of the functions under consideration. By duplicating inputs, the authors aim to create a scenario where the function's behavior can be analyzed under translations that are not just along the diagonal but also across the entire space X × X. This duplication allows for a more comprehensive examination of the function's equivariance properties.\n\nThe proof strategy involves showing that if a function is diagonally translation equivariant, it can be extended to be (X × X)-translation equivariant by defining its behavior for non-diagonal translations. This is achieved by ensuring that the function behaves consistently under translations that include both diagonal and non-diagonal components.

{"question":"What are the limitations of using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (ITSC) systems, and how do these limitations impact the model's performance in dynamic and data-scarce environments?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[37],"raw_output":"","pred":"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (ITSC) systems face several limitations that impact their performance in dynamic and data-scarce environments. Firstly, HMMs assume that the underlying system follows the Markov property, meaning that the probability of transitioning to a new state depends only on the current state and not on the past states. This assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios where traffic conditions can be influenced by a long history of states and observations. For instance, traffic congestion can build up gradually over time, requiring a more complex model that accounts for historical data.\n\nSecondly, HMMs heavily rely on sufficient training data to estimate model parameters accurately. In environments with limited historical traffic data, such as newly developed neighborhoods, the performance of HMMs can be compromised. The scarcity of representative training data leads to less precise parameter estimation, which in turn affects the model's ability to accurately predict traffic conditions.\n\nAdditionally, HMMs struggle with rare events that are not well-represented in the training data. For example, major sporting events or large-scale construction projects can significantly impact traffic patterns, but these events are often not adequately captured in the training dataset, leading to poor model performance during such events. These limitations highlight the need for more robust and adaptable models that can handle the complexities and uncertainties inherent in dynamic traffic environments.","source":"data/test/2405.17691.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,36,39,43,56,38,44,45,62,210,213,40,55,5,52,42,58,47,139,18,41,137,53,22,49,50,152,30,214,13,34,61,239,20,21,46,64,151,240,24,51,48,32,65,219,228,140,148,224,113,66,14,117,215,226,35,105,115,235,67,155,206,225,3,68,59,230,8,57,156,161,233,80,110,81,138,207,141,236,31,220,221,222,25,234,63,157,164,19,237,4,198,17,26,60,160,218,229,9,75,180,227,232,153,205,231,116,144,201,203,208,73,204,163,191,23,74,103,196,238,149,162,165,188,209,101,159,33,166,2,10,193,197,200,150,154,183,168,7,106,217,223,28,6,29,69,142,211,78,79,98,178,212,11,100,16,54,158,174,173,192,145,111,172,70,90,118,119,184,167,189,202,130,88,89,186,135,169,179,187,194,176,199,27,120,132,143,216,72,136,171,122,112,175,104,170,91,102,185,190,134,114,121,83,87,124,195,97,126,177,241,109,86,93,107,99,127,71,182,77,94,1,96,85,123,128,181,82,108,129,133,146,125,95,76,84,147,131,92,15,12],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

For MNISTlc models, there is a clear and strong linear relationship between the max margin and the measured margin, as indicated by the gradual increase in the average margin as the max margin increases. This relationship is particularly strong for samples with very small max margins (< 2). This suggests that the proximity of the nearest sample of another class has a significant impact on the margin of each sample, and this effect is more pronounced in MNISTlc models.\n\nIn contrast, for CIFAR10lc models, the relationship between max margin and measured margin is weaker. The CIFAR10 models exhibit less label corruption compared to MNIST models (10% vs. 20%), which might explain the less clear relationship. The underlying reason for this discrepancy could be attributed to the different nature of the datasets and the input space modeling. Euclidean distance in the input space is more suitable for capturing visual similarity in MNIST, making it a better metric for understanding the relationship between max margin and measured margin. On the other hand, for CIFAR10, the input space might not be as effectively modeled using Euclidean distance, leading to a weaker correlation between the two metrics.

This suggests that a larger mean constrained margin is generally beneficial for generalization, but not always indicative of optimal performance.\n\nThis limitation relates to the field of adversarial examples in a few key ways:\n\n1.

For MNIST data, the distribution is centered around 1.0, indicating that the test data points are closely aligned with the training gradient space, suggesting that the model's predictions are highly consistent with the training data. In contrast, for FMNIST data, the distribution is shifted to the left, with a mean of 0.94, indicating that the test data points are less aligned with the training gradient space. This suggests that the model's predictions for FMNIST data are less consistent with the training data.\n\nThe implications of this difference are crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The leftward shift in the distribution for FMNIST data suggests that the model's predictions for out-of-distribution data are more likely to be orthogonal to the training gradient space. This orthogonality can be leveraged to identify OOD data points, as they are less likely to follow the learned patterns of the training data. By analyzing the gradients and their projections, one can detect when the model's predictions deviate significantly from the training data, which is a key indicator of OOD data. This approach can enhance the robustness of the model by improving its ability to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, thereby reducing false positives and false negatives in OOD detection.","source":"data/test/2407.11029v1.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[128,13,145,129,119,120,161,118,122,91,194,55,110,111,78,186,183,80,138,83,168,131,170,84,136,172,81,113,189,171,177,41,191,182,10,68,132,190,154,178,185,9,43,70,127,69,139,7,16,112,181,5,121,133,79,85,166,49,72,142,149,160,174,73,62,77,82,105,54,143,103,11,123,90,115,14,38,59,74,76,134,21,42,155,179,130,109,137,6,108,33,44,86,107,51,32,46,58,114,18,57,97,167,37,63,4,56,61,65,71,93,47,141,146,173,188,60,184,22,40,89,101,117,144,148,12,39,88,157,95,102,126,140,20,29,176,192,96,106,124,153,193,26,92,135,158,31,52,125,180,15,24,75,87,98,165,8,67,175,27,28,94,195,50,169,30,156,36,99,104,187,45,23,25,48,66,17,164,64,151,152,53,100,35,150,116,34,147,1,2,162,163,159,19,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"Given the information in the table and the context of adversarial example generation, what can you infer about the relationship between a network's complexity, the distortion required for a successful attack, and the persistence of both natural and adversarial examples?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[72],"raw_output":"","pred":"The table and context reveal a clear relationship between a network's complexity, the distortion required for a successful adversarial attack, and the persistence of both natural and adversarial examples. As network complexity increases, the average distortion required for a successful attack decreases. This trend is evident from the FC10 networks (with fewer parameters) to the FC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10 networks (with more parameters). For instance, FC10-4 requires a higher average distortion (0.123) compared to FC100-100-10 (0.086) and FC200-200-10 (0.087).\n\nConcurrently, the persistence of adversarial examples tends to decrease as network complexity increases. This is reflected in the lower average persistence values for adversarial examples in more complex networks. For example, FC10-4 has an adversarial persistence of 1.68, while FC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10 have adversarial persistence values of 0.56.\n\nThe context explains that networks with fewer effective parameters are more likely to generate adversarial examples with high distortion, making them inherently more stable. Conversely, more complex networks, with their increased parameter count, are more likely to exhibit decision boundaries with more curvature, leading to lower distortion and higher persistence for adversarial examples. This relationship underscores the importance of network complexity in determining the robustness and stability of adversarial examples.","source":"data/test/2407.11029v1.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[72,71,69,156,16,154,44,8,58,54,46,60,84,55,40,62,75,9,15,21,61,83,76,158,85,48,70,74,43,59,39,82,52,73,56,68,143,157,5,17,155,41,49,145,142,50,23,45,14,18,38,10,113,51,105,177,189,4,78,190,7,138,176,79,22,42,144,181,47,53,63,192,77,87,118,20,180,160,186,179,152,129,182,188,194,86,25,153,172,80,171,193,92,187,103,137,97,122,174,12,88,94,112,106,111,173,110,57,109,27,93,170,32,13,81,139,184,66,128,146,168,31,130,133,134,165,127,147,195,108,115,136,148,95,107,123,91,117,120,124,167,6,29,90,125,149,185,28,140,178,175,1,65,67,102,114,26,37,89,116,119,131,132,169,104,191,135,161,33,96,11,24,34,101,30,35,121,183,64,164,36,141,159,162,150,163,98,166,99,126,151,19,2,100,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As shown in Figure B.6, the persistence values change dramatically when crossing the decision boundary, especially with smaller γ values. This sensitivity to γ suggests that persistence is highly dependent on the specific landscape of the decision boundary.\n\nThe implication is that persistence provides a nuanced measure of classifier stability that reflects the underlying geometry of the decision boundary. A smaller γ value captures more fine-grained details of the boundary, while a larger γ value provides a broader view. This sensitivity indicates that persistence is not just a simple measure of stability, but rather a complex interaction between the classifier's decision boundary and the input data distribution.\n\nThe fact that persistence changes dramatically near the boundary implies that small perturbations can lead to large changes in classification, especially in regions of high curvature.

This enhanced feature representation leads to better discrimination and higher ROC-AUC values compared to MLP models, which are less adept at handling graph-structured data.","source":"data/test/2407.12243.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[93,92,96,50,14,95,56,51,94,53,52,11,30,10,55,16,75,13,97,57,76,79,78,66,89,142,21,86,108,54,90,46,77,106,128,27,152,156,110,81,107,140,141,144,150,157,64,113,19,151,39,42,155,29,58,149,154,158,111,127,145,98,65,134,43,137,84,87,82,83,109,8,91,138,18,85,153,71,147,148,80,136,17,59,100,143,40,69,118,135,68,105,117,133,26,47,60,41,70,63,112,132,62,22,116,28,49,38,72,119,3,48,139,20,24,36,74,32,67,104,122,33,131,34,37,73,146,35,44,124,31,99,129,159,25,115,101,121,120,61,125,7,15,102,1,2,103,123,9,5,6,12,4,45,130,88,126,114,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This suggests that optimizing for Detection Accuracy has a substantial positive impact on Concept Masking, indicating that the algorithm is better at identifying and explaining the most relevant concepts.\n\nThis improvement in Concept Masking, along with the increase in Sample Coverage and Detection Accuracy, suggests a positive correlation between these metrics. However, the drop in IoU and Activation Coverage scores to zero indicates a potential trade-off or conflict between these metrics and Detection Accuracy. The IoU metric, which is commonly used to measure the alignment between labels and activations, is penalized when the algorithm focuses on explaining more relevant concepts, as seen in the drop in its score.\n\nThese results underscore the complexity of optimizing neuron explanations and highlight the importance of using multiple metrics simultaneously to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the quality of the explanations. The trade-offs between different metrics suggest that optimizing for one metric may not necessarily optimize all others, and a balanced approach is necessary to ensure the explanations are both accurate and meaningful.","source":"data/test/2407.12243.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[111,104,66,51,79,110,13,14,80,67,52,108,55,78,11,22,57,68,93,76,92,65,86,87,7,44,145,10,81,94,95,107,33,50,106,38,53,116,21,98,113,34,96,41,43,84,39,69,118,136,82,151,27,32,77,83,129,137,8,18,20,46,58,75,42,64,90,147,149,60,105,133,24,40,112,140,144,56,127,159,70,121,128,54,109,138,141,150,19,36,37,97,120,122,124,158,35,91,119,71,89,134,3,26,31,85,117,125,135,143,123,139,142,154,157,28,153,155,17,49,62,115,131,152,48,63,74,148,132,100,146,30,73,99,156,59,47,16,72,25,15,29,114,12,101,1,2,45,130,61,103,5,88,102,126,6,9,4,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

For example, if a model is biased towards certain background colors, the inspection will show that the memory samples associated with high weights are predominantly images with those colors. This can help developers identify and address biases in the model's decision-making process.\n\n2. Understanding feature importance: Memory Wrap allows users to see which samples have the most influence on the model's predictions. This can provide insights into which features or patterns are most critical for the model's decision-making. \n\nFor instance, in a classification task, if the model relies heavily on a specific texture or shape, the inspection reveals these patterns. This transparency can:\n\n- Help explain why certain predictions are made\n- Guide feature engineering to improve model robustness\n- Identify potential overfitting to specific samples\n- Validate the model's reliance on meaningful features rather than noise\n\nBy providing this level of detail, Memory Wrap can enhance model interpretability and trustworthiness, addressing issues like explainability and fairness that are crucial beyond just accuracy.","source":"data/test/2407.12243.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[84,77,85,11,83,13,71,87,75,10,70,73,80,82,79,8,76,74,86,81,72,78,68,129,67,69,33,60,127,66,97,42,65,128,3,21,115,18,43,59,93,94,121,58,89,111,19,55,137,138,136,113,41,98,122,40,20,32,52,57,62,91,95,44,53,116,51,100,147,150,56,106,119,144,152,17,143,22,31,36,39,108,29,37,64,112,139,141,145,133,149,63,96,142,158,35,125,117,134,140,155,156,110,132,148,34,38,46,124,151,153,27,105,49,104,54,92,120,123,154,157,135,90,118,146,26,131,101,109,6,102,14,24,159,7,16,47,50,99,28,103,107,5,30,61,48,130,4,25,1,2,114,9,88,126,12,45,23,15],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This would allow for more versatile and practical use of pretrained language models in real-world NLP tasks.","source":"data/test/2404.12150.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[42,28,57,43,25,41,29,31,8,46,27,78,18,32,85,86,54,50,6,44,12,89,15,74,45,33,58,17,90,10,91,52,56,30,84,76,24,9,48,13,20,35,71,55,16,37,75,79,118,34,14,59,5,19,26,129,21,145,73,120,130,36,60,125,126,51,22,23,102,105,122,124,68,11,69,2,39,65,132,49,67,95,103,116,117,53,134,61,77,92,121,136,142,47,87,115,138,143,144,72,104,140,137,108,147,70,109,110,123,128,139,106,141,7,66,82,131,107,133,64,98,135,146,1,38,63,113,112,119,3,127,81,93,97,101,62,88,111,148,94,100,80,40,99,83,114,96,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This is a key step in the proof.\n\n \n\nSpecifically:\n\n- The proof starts by assuming f is conformal and uses this to establish that Jf(y) is lower triangular for all y.\n- It then argues that if Jf(y) were diagonal everywhere, f would be an element-wise function.\n- The conformality ensures that f's Jacobian has a specific structure (diagonal for conformal maps).\n\n- The contradiction arises because the assumption of f being conformal leads to a situation where the Jacobian must be diagonal everywhere, which contradicts the independence of the transformed variables.\n\n- This contradiction is used to conclude that Cima(f ◦ aR(ps), ps) > 0, demonstrating that the Darmois construction is distinguishable from conformal maps.\n\nThe conformality assumption is thus essential for linking the properties of f to the structure of its Jacobian, which is central to the proof's logic.","source":"data/test/2406.13371.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[158,62,156,61,157,63,159,180,160,171,183,161,166,169,163,165,168,155,108,177,176,181,48,110,175,109,174,172,173,153,164,182,57,162,184,81,82,167,102,125,154,53,56,71,106,83,105,151,178,51,84,28,89,170,66,107,113,23,27,40,60,104,179,13,75,54,58,152,67,98,78,114,24,115,11,12,46,103,41,69,80,126,72,9,38,29,59,146,55,96,90,100,15,94,49,97,134,111,117,43,79,93,140,44,45,70,73,91,149,116,119,135,92,144,19,26,77,143,47,50,68,137,185,21,121,129,147,25,127,148,30,74,123,20,36,76,132,141,142,22,112,145,34,2,4,6,8,10,14,18,33,39,52,124,128,139,150,42,130,131,138,186,88,32,122,133,35,64,99,101,95,118,136,5,7,31,87,37,120,86,16,65,85,1,17,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

In the left panel, the base-level activation (BLL) is calculated based on the frequency and recency of genre usage. Genre g1 has a higher activation level than g2 because it was used more frequently and recently. However, in the right panel, the associative activation is also considered. This activation is influenced by the strength of associations (Sj,i) between the target genre (g1 or g2) and other contextual genres. The contextual genres, represented by the black nodes, have weights (Wc) that determine their influence on the target genre's activation.\n\nThe associative activation can significantly alter the ranking. For instance, if genre g2 has strong associations with other popular genres, its activation level can be boosted, potentially making it more relevant than g1, even if g1 was used more frequently. This is because the associative activation takes into account the current context and the relevance of the target genre to other popular genres.\n\nThis difference in ranking has important implications for the accuracy and personalization of recommendations. By considering associative activation, the system can provide more personalized and contextually relevant recommendations. Users are more likely to discover genres that align with their current listening habits and preferences, leading to higher acceptance rates and better overall satisfaction.

The BLL equation models the re-listening behavior of users, and 'd' is a parameter that quantifies the rate at which re-listening decreases over time. By fitting a linear regression to the log-log plot of re-listening count versus time since the last LE, the slope of the regression line provides an estimate for 'd'. This parameter is crucial because it captures the temporal decay of re-listening behavior, which is a fundamental aspect of user preferences in music recommendation systems.\n\nThe implications of this parameter for the transparency and accuracy of the BLLu music recommendation algorithm are significant. A well-calibrated 'd' parameter ensures that the BLLu algorithm accurately reflects the user's re-listening behavior, thereby improving the recommendation accuracy.

This approach allows the model to understand and generate complex language structures that are grounded in both visual and computational contexts.\n","source":"data/test/2406.09662.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[20,35,170,3,169,23,93,19,8,21,28,10,22,171,97,15,29,119,34,139,104,55,71,121,31,33,30,5,11,100,16,70,95,9,46,96,147,57,111,184,99,113,65,14,127,182,198,140,175,37,82,39,32,126,27,64,107,142,199,1,193,123,181,187,197,69,38,122,133,59,91,176,66,54,58,63,125,135,192,41,52,92,43,60,90,115,189,188,56,108,18,196,68,94,173,180,191,101,103,174,183,6,50,40,51,130,178,138,185,194,48,132,162,195,49,118,179,4,12,62,112,155,124,134,137,73,89,117,146,72,105,110,151,13,165,45,131,163,164,42,141,149,186,53,74,84,161,61,87,88,106,67,116,177,36,86,136,159,47,102,128,166,160,109,148,153,168,25,172,98,114,167,44,83,120,190,145,26,143,154,144,150,152,7,156,79,200,85,129,81,77,75,24,80,157,78,17,158,2,76],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This can be achieved by using a logical operation that excludes the intersection of shiny and cube objects.\n\n2. **Implement the concept**: In the DSL, define a new concept `eitherShinyOrCube` that combines `SHINY` and `CUBE` but excludes the intersection. This can be done by using a logical OR operation followed by a logical NOT operation on the intersection.\n\n3. **Modify the filter operation**: Update the `filter` operation to use the new `eitherShinyOrCube` concept instead of `SHINY` or `CUBE` alone.

This mechanism reduces the training time by performing local marginalization over derivations, effectively pruning the space of possible derivations. Essentially, CKY-E2 allows the algorithm to consider all possible programs associated with each span, rather than just parsing trees. This approach ensures that the algorithm explores the full compositional space but does so efficiently by focusing on derivations that are most likely to lead to successful execution.\n\nBy doing so, CKY-E2 enables the model to handle the exponential growth of possible derivations without becoming computationally infeasible. This is crucial for learning in grounded environments where the number of possible meanings for a sentence can grow exponentially with the number of words and their combinations. The algorithm's ability to marginalize over derivations and prune unnecessary computations makes it possible to learn from small amounts of data and generalize to novel compositions of words, thereby improving the model's compositional generalization capabilities.","source":"data/test/2406.09662.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[93,95,119,103,100,96,102,17,104,117,120,97,108,112,113,99,171,110,14,98,118,111,116,105,172,185,125,123,175,19,43,183,187,34,115,170,184,1,154,198,48,81,101,114,181,199,21,94,130,180,16,44,145,176,173,182,186,49,10,61,37,55,56,107,126,138,39,40,42,73,188,33,64,66,169,78,191,30,32,147,194,197,38,62,131,179,196,109,144,153,52,155,70,192,25,177,189,29,139,159,178,193,60,190,4,45,174,35,47,137,5,122,20,76,121,141,23,54,129,132,136,8,11,156,195,3,50,133,18,24,57,146,31,41,63,142,28,75,90,134,135,22,36,59,152,79,46,13,164,15,128,158,67,167,124,53,143,165,80,91,6,87,150,69,77,92,160,148,84,149,162,9,127,51,83,86,106,161,71,140,58,163,200,82,157,26,74,151,65,72,85,27,68,89,12,88,2,166,168,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The table shows a clear pattern where conditional beam search outputs are more likely to be grammatical and complete, while unconditional beam search often results in truncated or incomplete sentences.\n\nFor instance, in the first example, the unconditional beam search outputs are all truncated versions of the reference sentence, such as \"The warehouse should not have been built so close to the residential building\" or \"The warehouse should not have been built at first\". These truncated versions lack the full context and grammatical structure of the reference.\n\nIn contrast, the conditional beam search outputs are more complete and grammatical, such as \"The warehouse should not have been built in such close proximity to residential buildings at the time of the incident\".

However, this approach sacrifices some output validity, as the training data might not perfectly match the sampling outputs, which have different properties.\n\nTo mitigate this, the document acknowledges the need for a wider range of samples to achieve good coverage of model behavior. It also suggests using outputs that start with beam search completions and then sample completions, which could help in achieving a better balance between input and output validity. This strategy aims to ensure that the training data is both representative and useful for the classifier, despite the inherent trade-offs.","source":"data/test/2408.16241.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[75,68,78,66,5,52,69,118,43,16,65,28,18,72,77,70,74,47,42,81,13,51,48,27,53,71,34,41,60,63,35,40,17,19,39,109,12,44,50,64,10,38,73,80,8,15,21,31,36,54,67,57,45,49,2,3,23,46,62,4,11,37,58,55,20,7,29,83,33,59,98,6,56,22,30,1,89,114,82,88,99,32,76,86,14,87,85,84,102,110,92,94,96,107,112,26,113,116,95,104,25,79,100,101,90,103,108,97,61,105,117,24,9,93,115,106,91,111],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How does the concept of typicality relate to the bad mode problem in the context of natural language generation, and why might atypicality sometimes be beneficial?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[47],"raw_output":"","pred":"The concept of typicality in natural language generation (NLG) is crucial for understanding the bad mode problem. Typically, a distribution assigns a weight to each possible outcome, and a typical sample is one that isn't much more or less likely to be observed than an average sample. In the context of NLG, this means that a typical sequence is one that is neither significantly more nor less probable than other sequences.\n\nThe bad mode problem arises when the most likely attribute value (e.g., the most common attribute in a sequence) does not match the attribute value of the most likely sequence. This can occur because the distribution assigns high probabilities to sequences that are not necessarily representative of the overall distribution.\n\nAtypicality, or the lack of equality between the most likely attribute value and the most likely sequence, can sometimes be beneficial. For instance, in text generation, a distribution might assign high probabilities to sequences that are not typical but are still useful for specific tasks. For example, a model might prioritize sequences that are grammatically correct but less creative, which can be beneficial in applications where accuracy is paramount.\n\nIn summary, while typicality helps in understanding the distribution of sequences, atypicality can be beneficial in scenarios where the model needs to prioritize specific, albeit less typical, outcomes for practical reasons.","source":"data/test/2408.16241.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[46,48,83,47,53,64,86,45,15,42,57,62,59,89,49,18,60,51,52,17,44,22,13,50,78,25,87,6,12,65,88,19,24,71,7,16,54,56,81,85,43,68,116,31,41,77,28,72,66,27,75,10,38,91,101,34,76,84,4,2,11,26,63,69,94,55,30,61,70,111,80,103,23,99,58,39,8,3,20,29,74,82,93,40,100,14,21,95,33,102,110,36,92,98,105,96,114,97,109,115,37,32,35,112,90,73,104,118,9,79,1,106,117,5,67,113,108,107],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This connection is pivotal for understanding how quantum circuits can be used to model and analyze causal relationships in a probabilistic framework.","source":"data/test/2408.07402.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[246,245,141,247,235,66,244,51,53,63,52,248,71,140,47,137,238,43,61,237,39,60,138,221,21,46,55,31,64,136,56,65,151,168,38,109,111,150,34,37,49,50,57,59,62,27,41,54,104,158,215,239,250,30,35,67,128,198,202,236,45,70,234,1,142,241,243,249,110,240,28,42,44,96,101,199,211,22,72,108,149,181,207,222,251,252,7,12,20,33,69,102,113,164,165,242,6,8,24,32,68,206,213,217,14,23,29,152,167,201,11,115,129,153,255,58,139,166,169,218,13,40,112,148,253,254,256,2,214,93,103,127,163,175,26,48,114,135,183,212,219,227,18,126,133,209,82,200,170,204,94,130,145,210,95,117,154,189,203,147,184,19,97,9,36,87,125,132,143,161,216,220,160,89,144,191,116,121,196,123,146,232,75,106,131,188,83,100,186,122,182,192,134,119,25,88,180,86,193,195,187,77,85,174,257,118,205,231,79,92,230,162,91,228,208,10,80,155,5,178,78,81,90,194,179,172,177,185,15,120,261,76,84,269,124,74,159,190,299,17,99,157,225,262,226,263,173,176,260,229,266,73,105,233,107,265,267,4,268,280,197,259,279,292,264,302,272,298,3,224,171,271,278,223,258,294,293,16,296,283,295,287,284,156,288,277,282,297,275,281,276,274,273,300,98,286,290,289,291,301,285,270],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"How does the value gained from digital experimentation and measurement (DEM) capabilities generally change as the capacity (M) increases, and what factor seems to most significantly influence this relationship across the different scenarios shown?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[63],"raw_output":"","pred":"The value gained from digital experimentation and measurement (DEM) capabilities generally decreases as the capacity (M) increases across the different scenarios shown in Figure 2.7. This trend is evident in all six plots, where the mean value (represented by the dot) decreases as M increases from 10 to 2,000. The value distribution, indicated by the error bars representing the 5th–95th percentile, also narrows, suggesting a more concentrated distribution of values as M grows.\n\nThe most significant factor influencing this relationship appears to be the estimation noise before and after the acquisition of DEM capabilities. The plots show that the value gained is highest when the estimation noise is reduced significantly (e.g., from (1%)² to (0.4%)²) and the capacity is relatively low. As the estimation noise reduction decreases (e.g., from (0.8%)² to (0.4%)²) or the capacity increases, the value gained decreases more rapidly.\n\nThis inverse relationship between capacity and value gained is explained by the diminishing returns principle. As the capacity increases, the most valuable work is completed first, leaving behind less valuable work that has many acceptable replacements. This limits the incremental value that DEM capabilities can provide. The specific point at which the value gain becomes statistically significant or reaches an acceptable Sharpe ratio is highly dependent on individual circumstances, such as the magnitude of estimation noise reduction and the initial capacity.","source":"data/test/2405.03579.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,60,62,66,63,64,65,68,17,59,36,38,19,46,40,55,195,35,41,45,5,44,52,56,48,42,54,11,22,50,39,58,197,21,23,43,47,20,154,26,37,67,196,1,170,199,198,75,167,145,193,182,102,124,144,235,142,146,175,121,156,166,189,30,113,151,162,174,85,95,106,109,132,172,49,88,105,150,157,168,181,76,141,164,191,214,25,99,140,152,155,160,69,108,117,131,176,183,70,83,112,173,73,87,114,137,190,206,72,118,126,134,153,100,101,143,158,163,177,186,201,129,138,71,119,130,148,184,253,18,92,86,123,161,202,91,133,188,226,228,24,79,97,159,165,187,242,13,14,103,127,149,169,171,185,221,93,192,225,227,231,236,249,128,230,15,96,104,107,237,250,4,7,211,218,12,207,3,135,147,212,213,238,243,57,115,120,217,229,241,244,9,29,74,98,81,82,125,180,205,220,203,210,222,8,28,178,234,247,252,2,6,10,16,116,122,136,194,200,204,224,239,251,33,78,94,209,240,34,51,80,208,216,232,31,179,245,223,53,215,248,219,32,90,77,246,233,254,84,89,110,139,111,27],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}]}

The false positive rate is defined as the probability of committing a Type I error when H0 is true.\n\nThis error occurs because the test has incorrectly signaled that there is a significant effect or difference when there is none. The false positive rate is an important consideration in hypothesis testing, as it represents the risk of making a wrong decision by rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n\nThe table also shows that the false positive rate is typically controlled by setting the significance level (α) of the test.

The top panel shows that under high estimation noise, a project with low true value (e.g., the mobile app) might appear to have a high value and be prioritized over a project with higher true value (e.g., the desktop enhancement).\n\nTo apply this to the scenario:\n\n1. **Estimate true values:**  The company would need to estimate the true value of each project.  This could involve user testing, market research, or other methods to gauge potential impact.\n\n2. **Assess estimation noise:**  The company should quantify the noise in their value estimates.

{"question":"How does changing the lengthscale parameter ψ in the random Fourier basis affect the smoothness and flexibility of the generated functions compared to the affine basis? Explain the relationship between ψ and the model's ability to fit different types of data.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[28],"raw_output":"","pred":"The lengthscale parameter ψ in the random Fourier basis significantly affects the smoothness and flexibility of the generated functions compared to the affine basis. A smaller value of ψ leads to a more flexible model with a thinner band-diagonal covariance structure. This increased flexibility allows the model to express functions that change more rapidly, making it suitable for capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Conversely, a larger value of ψ results in a smoother model, which is better suited for fitting data that exhibits less variability and can be approximated by simpler, smoother functions.\n\nThe relationship between ψ and the model's ability to fit different types of data is direct: smaller ψ values enable the model to fit more complex, non-linear data, while larger ψ values are more effective for fitting simpler, linear or nearly linear data. This flexibility is crucial because it allows the model to adapt to the underlying structure of the data. For instance, in the toy 1d dataset shown in Figure 2.3, the random Fourier model with a smaller ψ (ψ = 0.3) can fit the non-linear relationship better than the affine model, which is limited to linear fits. The evidence of the model, as shown in Figure 2.9, quantifies this trade-off, indicating that while the Fourier model with ψ = 0.3 can fit the data more closely, it also incurs a higher penalty due to its increased flexibility.","source":"data/test/2404.19157.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[29,28,30,50,51,33,32,47,36,96,26,10,31,39,40,69,43,204,25,54,105,57,175,98,176,198,115,153,53,35,62,72,100,108,123,52,34,120,135,165,38,139,155,224,112,122,46,58,59,93,101,113,119,128,133,142,194,110,114,141,149,44,127,148,150,151,97,106,136,137,177,201,19,55,64,71,84,88,95,158,180,41,107,156,169,173,181,183,27,70,79,104,131,174,185,222,18,68,74,77,82,130,134,143,152,171,197,12,37,67,94,125,144,48,103,154,160,167,199,203,219,42,102,138,145,146,147,164,193,65,66,124,126,170,178,208,220,49,56,129,159,163,192,223,233,9,20,61,140,157,179,186,210,216,45,73,75,80,87,92,162,172,213,60,86,89,99,161,188,215,221,196,78,90,132,206,214,226,231,117,211,212,217,7,76,11,21,81,209,22,85,168,205,218,8,63,195,225,232,184,207,17,23,83,109,227,166,182,200,230,16,229,91,121,187,15,13,118,24,189,190,111,191,1,5,2,4,6,14,116,228,234,202,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

It is robust to the high density of points near zero, which can lead to an ill-conditioned kernel matrix, a common issue in CG. SGD's performance is consistent, making it a reliable choice for this scenario.\n- **CG:** CG struggles with the ill-conditioned kernel matrix, leading to convergence issues. It requires more compute to achieve convergence, and even then, it may produce significant errors if stopped prematurely.\n- **VI:** Variational Inference with inducing points (SVGP) can summarize the data effectively with fewer inducing points (20 in this case), making it computationally efficient.

This is because the TV prior alone can produce reconstructions with sharp edges and artifacts, especially when applied to complex images like the one shown in the target text.\n\nBy combining the TV prior with a prior over the weights that incorporates TV-smoothness, the model is encouraged to produce smoother reconstructions. This is achieved by placing a block-diagonal Matérn-1/2 covariance Gaussian prior on the weights, which constrains the filters to be smooth. \n\nThis approach is preferable for several reasons:\n1. It helps mitigate artifacts that can arise from the TV prior alone, especially in regions with complex structures.\n2. It allows for more accurate uncertainty estimation by providing a more realistic prior distribution over the weights.\n3.

Initially, in (a), the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is large (Td/2), allowing for long-term dependencies. This is evident as the kernels cover a broader range of time delays, capturing temporal patterns over extended periods. As training progresses, the standard deviation decreases in (b) and (c), enabling the model to focus on shorter-term dependencies and refine the precision of synaptic weights. By the final phase in (c), the kernels have narrowed significantly, indicating that the model has learned to distinguish between closely spaced spikes, enhancing the precision of the synaptic weights.\n\nThe final delays after rounding in (d) further illustrate this trade-off. The kernels are converted to discrete kernels, with delays rounded to the nearest integer. This rounding process simplifies the kernels, making them more suitable for inference on neuromorphic hardware. The significant reduction in delay positions from (c) to (d) demonstrates that the model has learned to pinpoint precise delay times, which is crucial for accurate spike timing in spiking neural networks.

Specifically, the time complexity of depthwise separable convolutions is \\(O(CkH^2)\\), which is much lower than the \\(O(C^2kH^2)\\) complexity of standard convolutions. This reduction is achieved by splitting the convolution process into two steps: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution.

The camera captures visual features in the environment, which are used to track the robot's position and orientation relative to the camera's viewpoint. The IMU, on the other hand, provides measurements of the robot's acceleration and angular velocity, which are essential for estimating its motion in the absence of visual information.\n\nThe fusion of information from these sensors is achieved by combining the visual data from the camera with the inertial measurements from the IMU. This integration allows the system to maintain accurate motion estimation even in low-light conditions or when visual features are not available. The camera's visual data helps in resolving ambiguities in the IMU's measurements, such as drift, by providing a reference frame for the robot's movement.\n\nHowever, poor initial conditions or calibration errors can pose significant challenges. Poor initial conditions, such as incorrect initial position or orientation, can lead to large errors in the initial state estimate. Calibration errors, particularly in the camera's extrinsic and intrinsic parameters, can further exacerbate these issues. These errors can cause the system to diverge from the true motion, resulting in inaccurate trajectory estimation. Additionally, unexpected disturbances during operation can introduce sudden changes in the calibration states, making it difficult for the system to maintain consistency and accuracy.

The classical EKF error, denoted as \\( e = \\xi - \\hat{\\xi} \\), is defined as the difference between the true state \\(\\xi\\) and the estimated state \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\). This error is constructed using local coordinates centered around the time-varying state estimate \\(\\hat{\\xi}(t)\\), which means it relies on changing local coordinates along a time-varying trajectory.\n\nIn contrast, the equivariant error is defined as \\( e = \\phi(\\hat{X}^{-1}, \\xi) \\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the transitive action of the Lie group \\(G\\) on the homogeneous space \\(M\\). This error is globally defined and does not rely on local coordinates. It is defined in a neighborhood of a fixed point \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\), making it a more robust and consistent measure.\n\nThe equivariant error provides an advantage in the design of the equivariant filter algorithm because it linearizes the error kinematics about a single set of coordinates. This global definition of the error kinematics leads to a more stable and accurate propagation of the error covariance, which is crucial for state estimation. Unlike the classical EKF, which linearizes the error kinematics along a time-varying trajectory and uses changing local coordinates, the equivariant error maintains a consistent and linearized representation, thereby improving the overall performance and reliability of the filter algorithm.","source":"data/test/2407.14297.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[51,58,50,49,59,67,123,94,179,130,52,80,9,93,46,159,17,107,86,8,20,162,11,44,172,23,111,24,48,161,57,117,119,136,157,54,135,6,22,66,137,141,156,13,68,79,126,177,60,16,53,152,155,47,115,150,164,82,118,158,98,132,62,163,173,89,112,114,133,142,109,154,5,85,87,128,144,149,71,176,21,91,105,127,139,140,96,160,83,131,146,153,10,18,108,1,88,102,122,143,65,92,110,129,138,147,55,56,63,113,148,151,14,101,12,97,125,134,178,45,84,145,90,106,95,99,103,78,170,100,120,121,81,104,124,116,174,33,74,77,180,15,32,19,72,73,166,75,169,171,29,76,28,69,175,31,27,70,168,37,39,35,41,38,42,36,4,7,25,64,167,40,61,43,26,30,34,165,2,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What is the purpose of line 7 in Algorithm 13, and how does it differ from a standard expert selection approach?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[127],"raw_output":"","pred":"Line 7 in Algorithm 13 is crucial for managing the switching behavior of the algorithm. It introduces a probabilistic mechanism that allows the algorithm to switch between experts with a certain probability, even if the current expert is performing well. This is different from a standard expert selection approach, which typically selects the best-performing expert at each step.\n\nIn a standard expert selection approach, the algorithm would always choose the expert with the lowest cumulative pseudo loss (the expert with the highest probability in the probability vector \\( p_m \\)). This ensures that the algorithm always selects the best expert based on past performance.\n\nHowever, Algorithm 13 introduces a probabilistic element by using the ratio \\( \\frac{w_{m, h_{m-1}}}{w_{m-1, h_{m-1}}} \\) to determine the probability of switching to the previous expert \\( h_{m-1} \\). This means that even if the current expert \\( h_m \\) is performing well, there is a chance that the algorithm will switch to \\( h_{m-1} \\) based on the probability calculated.\n\nThis probabilistic switching helps in managing the switching cost, which is a significant factor in the regret analysis. By allowing occasional switches, the algorithm can avoid getting stuck in a suboptimal expert for too long, which could lead to higher regret. This mechanism is particularly useful in scenarios where the switching cost is high, as it helps in balancing the trade-off between exploitation (staying with the best expert) and exploration (switching to potentially better experts).","source":"data/test/2408.01596.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[311,127,125,110,309,26,298,41,185,214,198,40,161,200,116,299,306,356,137,96,138,140,68,114,27,224,251,115,273,297,354,111,355,112,213,79,167,7,97,291,300,303,312,62,124,288,310,357,95,139,222,287,334,67,289,347,25,230,250,286,352,69,164,168,225,78,144,172,301,23,120,194,342,133,176,8,122,147,149,221,226,278,313,94,113,295,10,11,228,266,323,350,28,150,157,17,126,197,244,302,331,341,82,102,249,246,335,348,90,236,245,6,92,134,142,199,215,235,247,257,268,274,314,333,351,38,109,173,178,186,267,269,5,105,153,174,272,292,315,343,39,83,152,166,263,330,345,89,91,103,121,187,242,101,117,148,171,181,50,93,154,195,252,264,344,76,16,73,146,307,308,158,163,169,229,243,248,279,281,9,49,123,262,63,66,128,189,220,256,304,99,277,346,33,45,81,129,175,294,359,75,85,87,88,100,265,51,183,196,201,261,326,353,15,22,31,180,275,30,104,118,192,254,64,160,237,258,305,328,24,77,135,227,238,285,290,317,340,60,86,119,170,21,36,57,61,132,203,241,324,34,72,131,136,162,20,80,191,193,219,280,370,32,55,84,184,188,284,98,179,182,190,322,363,71,151,282,332,337,74,207,327,159,202,223,349,368,44,177,260,270,14,59,234,296,325,358,37,58,106,156,253,255,276,18,42,210,212,29,56,145,271,321,13,46,108,143,338,365,141,206,293,19,47,259,361,107,375,204,70,165,208,209,217,339,43,283,360,231,329,362,364,1,239,367,35,130,233,54,211,320,372,374,318,373,48,65,316,52,366,2,155,205,218,319,369,371,12,53,216,3,232,336,240,376,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This highlights the importance of observing the original feature vector before making predictions for more efficient learning.","source":"data/test/2408.01596.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[23,24,25,29,22,33,42,174,5,169,13,36,21,32,35,14,40,20,158,178,160,183,28,38,159,26,30,34,148,149,157,170,185,147,200,354,168,340,113,142,37,153,27,78,151,184,75,150,163,188,195,19,47,50,165,45,89,116,120,186,189,193,199,345,7,164,221,351,373,348,350,355,18,76,77,107,122,137,145,197,198,259,8,31,81,98,143,146,152,214,342,54,61,138,154,166,171,179,242,339,343,41,79,132,141,234,367,74,118,123,130,131,136,190,194,205,257,363,15,105,108,110,111,119,129,135,227,243,318,327,359,112,125,162,175,191,230,236,238,262,273,322,337,2,44,57,62,64,82,92,97,99,109,172,206,213,235,256,326,335,344,46,49,58,65,69,90,133,140,222,245,263,270,309,353,371,72,91,187,202,246,266,301,303,312,328,55,66,67,68,124,144,249,274,313,315,323,100,310,349,369,201,306,341,356,60,83,85,93,128,316,366,96,121,203,219,228,240,254,268,278,302,307,357,364,374,39,51,134,251,271,272,314,319,329,370,48,127,177,208,212,220,237,324,325,332,334,63,73,88,114,196,347,360,84,104,210,265,304,362,161,192,361,368,94,101,102,103,106,126,181,260,264,286,365,87,176,241,253,284,300,16,80,86,155,298,308,52,211,244,250,252,311,352,59,95,224,255,330,346,115,248,317,358,11,12,217,269,229,333,267,280,299,204,215,247,283,167,231,320,173,180,207,218,279,321,226,239,287,372,70,139,297,17,71,261,331,336,292,53,225,275,290,375,223,9,289,6,209,43,258,305,281,296,288,3,10,277,293,294,282,295,285,56,338,291,276,4,1,233,232,376,182,117,156,216],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Here are the key steps in the reasoning:\n\n1. It starts by noting that ℒneighborhood(G) is hard to estimate directly because we cannot observe the true neighborhood of sampled x.\n\n2. It introduces the concept of a consistent graph G, which is a graph that correctly predicts the true label for all sampled x.\n\n3. The proof then shows that for any consistent graph G, the empirical loss bℒneighborhood(G) is zero:\n\nbℒneighborhood(G) = 1/T Σt=1T 1(NG★(xt) ≠ NG(xt)) = 0\n\n4. This means that the empirical loss of a consistent graph is zero, even though the true loss ℒneighborhood(G) is not.\n\n5. The proof then connects the empirical loss of a consistent graph to the proxy loss ℒproxy(G):\n\nbℒneighborhood(G) ≤ 2/k Σt=1T Pr(v ∼ NG★(xt))(v ∉ NG(xt))\n\n6. This step uses the fact that G is consistent to relate the empirical loss to the proxy loss.\n\n7.

By combining these steps, the proof concludes that with high probability, the true loss ℒneighborhood(G) is small.\n\nThe key insight is that while we can't directly measure ℒneighborhood(G), we can use the consistent graph G to indirectly estimate it through the proxy loss. This approach allows the algorithm to learn a good graph without needing to observe the true neighborhoods of all samples.","source":"data/test/2408.01596.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[191,194,192,39,37,198,196,197,189,187,38,168,184,193,340,42,185,350,195,344,339,65,174,137,352,41,152,190,326,341,343,348,134,142,188,200,124,164,351,40,327,342,141,153,315,136,140,177,186,109,237,313,320,36,50,78,112,298,302,234,272,309,159,323,335,354,358,183,199,317,319,332,333,355,29,30,114,356,25,122,123,329,149,257,289,113,28,238,266,287,26,268,279,306,316,8,49,173,178,274,162,165,169,225,280,296,307,314,322,331,34,68,138,154,208,228,262,325,33,157,300,312,318,337,64,116,126,127,161,175,204,211,222,303,336,69,96,163,203,205,210,226,54,80,139,286,310,346,23,243,245,259,278,283,27,61,170,256,293,295,334,32,120,133,291,13,51,67,81,180,209,260,288,9,135,236,244,250,269,271,330,14,53,60,77,94,150,151,221,240,301,91,110,148,252,282,324,10,147,242,7,16,129,214,255,258,267,304,79,82,220,235,251,281,107,254,263,290,366,85,146,261,353,360,22,35,92,158,172,230,45,83,105,145,219,253,98,111,201,349,357,2,5,75,118,119,130,160,166,321,328,345,347,131,229,19,24,143,218,108,207,217,73,128,132,171,264,31,74,104,115,48,125,265,374,56,63,86,362,15,66,101,102,224,292,299,365,17,44,76,100,106,144,206,247,338,369,70,72,97,99,212,361,103,179,227,368,373,21,90,241,294,364,371,57,59,155,305,3,18,20,121,215,239,273,363,47,84,95,89,167,4,88,311,359,367,58,93,372,52,43,213,284,285,270,370,176,249,11,71,87,6,246,181,297,55,248,46,62,231,376,308,202,223,275,375,277,276,1,182,12,156,117,233,232,216],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The figure shows a sequence of demonstrations where a robot arm drops an object from a central position to a left or right pot. By applying diffeomorphic transforms, the robot's motion is warped to achieve the desired outcome. Specifically, the diffeomorphic transforms are crafted to bias the motion towards the neighboring pots, effectively shifting the robot's trajectory to drop the object in the desired pot.\n\nThis capability is significant for real-world robotic applications because it allows for flexible and adaptive motion control. Without requiring new demonstrations for each desired position, the robot can be programmed to perform tasks in different environments or under varying conditions. This enhances the robot's versatility and reduces the need for extensive training data, making it more efficient and adaptable in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. The ability to modify motion based on user specifications without additional training data is particularly valuable in applications such as manufacturing, logistics, and service robotics, where tasks may need to be adjusted on the fly.","source":"data/test/2407.10383.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[171,166,12,151,20,152,170,159,172,153,164,150,28,161,167,169,154,155,156,163,165,112,160,168,198,162,111,6,200,157,217,19,73,24,30,176,211,17,90,25,50,75,93,209,195,23,193,92,197,126,85,132,190,199,88,15,3,26,173,192,175,179,5,13,213,34,130,147,158,174,188,196,18,113,121,72,95,124,140,144,99,134,56,83,89,141,189,46,123,133,145,148,187,203,204,87,125,131,135,205,9,58,71,86,137,194,207,29,110,210,216,122,78,105,129,11,84,143,178,208,33,36,63,139,182,4,10,32,53,77,114,120,185,14,59,60,103,118,16,47,51,104,43,177,201,35,42,67,74,108,109,117,127,202,57,69,94,116,128,136,206,215,76,214,40,41,98,106,183,27,68,212,80,39,48,184,186,52,54,107,138,31,81,101,62,70,82,96,102,22,44,37,79,97,21,49,66,149,119,7,8,38,218,146,181,64,45,65,115,100,142,1,180,61,191,91,55,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Specifically, the Cont- method achieves an MRE of 0.13±0.02 when trained on the full dataset, while the MM-Dis method achieves an MRE of 0.29±0.02. When trained on a 5% random subset, the Cont- method's MRE is 0.19±0.10, and the MM-Dis method's MRE is 0.74±0.18.\n\nThe observed changes indicate that the continuous mapping method is more robust and less sensitive to the amount of training data. The performance degradation for the MM-Dis method is more pronounced when the training data is reduced to 5%, with a significant increase in MRE. This suggests that the multimodal discrete method relies heavily on the quantity of training data to accurately model the directional distributions.

The researchers note that this difference is likely due to factors such as gender distribution in the population, the way participants were recruited, or other demographic factors.","source":"data/test/2406.15375.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[275,184,288,294,278,284,277,281,290,286,188,293,295,291,182,289,189,187,298,279,297,287,183,283,285,194,196,282,14,192,217,186,292,300,190,301,276,195,16,185,302,280,316,191,334,193,299,211,203,335,13,303,317,323,333,152,318,330,331,11,145,148,296,309,319,314,327,179,181,307,321,328,178,339,308,310,315,320,322,324,85,311,312,329,332,9,207,341,237,88,149,270,326,338,340,141,230,336,325,346,39,40,221,313,342,349,119,234,180,218,337,347,348,84,10,94,140,164,259,306,344,78,224,235,151,166,345,15,117,206,208,219,261,126,176,353,171,212,343,24,150,350,147,159,177,220,223,95,161,202,240,48,135,156,205,257,4,104,160,209,231,239,65,92,101,146,248,31,32,41,67,75,143,222,63,162,233,351,8,64,118,125,18,249,2,68,163,255,258,66,74,86,168,247,83,123,155,225,252,253,273,304,106,129,272,62,87,153,251,256,12,28,97,271,76,120,167,266,25,44,61,213,246,23,33,34,37,116,244,254,260,305,127,134,138,144,165,204,173,43,77,102,122,136,269,49,57,72,115,137,158,243,268,80,107,128,130,229,355,36,90,175,226,241,242,250,35,265,73,89,114,198,51,91,96,262,6,22,58,98,99,108,245,46,47,109,113,139,228,19,53,56,112,121,263,71,132,133,274,45,105,154,267,7,50,142,197,236,21,70,199,216,1,100,200,201,214,264,20,26,42,157,354,232,27,54,55,103,227,69,124,79,81,169,38,52,93,131,210,82,174,215,3,5,352,29,60,30,59,170,172,111,17,110,238],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What is the relationship between the \"Coverage\" and \"Number of Coding References\" columns in the table, and how might this relationship be significant for analyzing the interview data?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[326],"raw_output":"","pred":"The \"Coverage\" and \"Number of Coding References\" columns in the table represent different aspects of the data analysis process for the interview questions. Coverage indicates the proportion of the total data set that has been coded, while the Number of Coding References shows how many times a particular code has been applied across the dataset.\n\nThe relationship between these two columns is significant for analyzing interview data because it provides insight into the depth and breadth of the coding process. A high coverage percentage (e.g., 0.9999) suggests that nearly all of the data has been coded, indicating thorough analysis. However, a high number of coding references (e.g., 1) for a given code might indicate that while the data has been coded, the coding is somewhat superficial or repetitive.\n\nThis relationship can be used to assess the quality and thoroughness of the coding. For example, if coverage is high but coding references are low, it may suggest that the coding process was thorough but not necessarily nuanced or varied. Conversely, high coding references with lower coverage might indicate extensive but possibly redundant coding.\n\nAnalyzing this relationship helps researchers understand how well their coding strategy captures the nuances of the interview data and whether the coding process is comprehensive and meaningful. It also allows for adjustments to the coding strategy if necessary, ensuring that the analysis is both thorough and insightful.","source":"data/test/2406.15375.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[314,327,333,337,318,330,329,309,338,350,317,332,334,340,346,308,313,336,319,343,348,349,316,323,307,311,315,326,328,335,310,321,322,325,331,345,342,320,306,344,339,347,312,204,97,136,279,206,40,117,118,159,324,11,301,9,191,125,122,276,82,87,115,146,144,156,341,66,123,16,65,135,54,70,165,78,124,139,158,249,293,8,93,94,148,231,244,287,302,44,98,210,305,31,41,57,63,121,138,175,283,289,10,25,100,162,189,245,286,303,304,152,164,205,272,290,351,77,90,257,280,282,300,72,112,134,142,181,190,219,291,53,89,143,292,45,56,92,109,145,203,256,83,126,177,183,196,247,7,15,37,85,157,193,207,220,13,64,111,163,176,195,217,67,180,184,211,224,232,354,14,33,62,155,178,208,236,275,299,110,151,179,234,277,294,61,76,149,161,212,228,46,47,150,200,225,258,298,167,174,222,241,154,202,263,267,352,75,86,209,254,19,28,88,264,52,60,81,106,182,288,235,281,295,353,12,58,71,80,274,201,260,261,4,50,116,141,230,2,38,237,297,36,114,173,221,233,262,296,32,79,137,192,259,35,95,119,197,129,187,218,248,253,266,34,43,69,120,147,160,172,170,30,96,226,239,273,285,99,107,131,140,255,39,252,265,284,108,213,229,240,22,68,101,186,74,166,243,269,271,127,132,223,355,238,246,51,59,128,20,130,102,251,23,84,198,29,168,227,18,24,103,214,242,250,26,48,153,169,268,5,104,27,91,17,73,171,21,194,215,216,6,278,133,270,185,1,188,55,113,42,49,3,199,105],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Firstly, it could expedite the implementation of e-government services by leveraging the private sector's expertise, resources, and infrastructure. This partnership could potentially reduce costs and accelerate the adoption of e-services, thereby improving service delivery and accessibility to the public. Additionally, the private sector's involvement could enhance the quality and efficiency of e-government services, as they often have advanced technological capabilities and operational experience.\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. One significant challenge is the risk of corruption, as identified by Participant 2. The private sector's involvement might introduce conflicts of interest and potential misuse of public funds, which could undermine the integrity and trustworthiness of e-government services. Furthermore, the private sector's focus on profit might lead to prioritizing commercial interests over public service needs, potentially compromising the quality and accessibility of e-services. Additionally, the lack of local government autonomy, as highlighted by Participant 2, could hinder the effective governance and oversight of these partnerships, further complicating the implementation and adoption of e-government services.","source":"data/test/2406.15375.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[285,261,314,237,191,233,173,211,236,264,18,195,280,61,336,198,219,226,268,277,294,2,94,35,69,117,178,203,217,220,223,232,235,265,273,281,284,41,126,166,32,140,109,187,221,40,225,279,275,286,106,201,202,73,190,230,152,182,229,29,36,129,167,193,227,295,14,22,28,179,263,282,180,189,200,269,8,128,177,208,231,68,95,176,212,224,96,172,192,119,197,199,234,287,58,353,66,214,222,312,27,316,328,20,186,260,266,334,348,23,31,228,297,315,339,288,323,338,67,318,10,115,154,283,306,351,118,169,272,335,12,13,112,114,194,292,308,38,249,256,341,347,62,72,164,340,320,325,331,1,24,330,15,207,298,33,168,253,344,350,39,104,185,44,107,181,248,276,6,56,34,63,64,75,84,196,307,43,65,301,317,175,245,85,311,26,103,213,252,302,21,60,127,183,209,240,293,174,218,46,153,158,170,309,326,345,47,239,241,332,7,16,147,342,45,102,110,143,86,278,171,250,313,49,57,111,296,300,310,149,243,322,333,108,254,141,251,355,76,98,291,321,238,59,188,259,290,327,271,303,101,247,304,255,19,113,324,25,78,258,319,329,70,246,9,155,162,216,55,244,257,346,74,77,89,51,130,133,151,79,100,148,42,99,242,349,91,337,71,343,90,138,299,37,88,210,215,48,161,53,54,92,93,97,146,30,289,160,137,142,80,4,50,132,156,204,52,81,144,163,184,121,157,159,122,11,17,150,87,267,123,135,131,105,120,274,270,125,205,82,139,165,83,206,116,262,136,354,352,134,145,124,3,305,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

For instance, (Siegmund et al. 2015) found that one-third of options significantly impact performance, while (Jamshidi & Casale 2016) noted that low-order interactions among a few dominating factors explain performance changes.\n\n2. **Configuration Parameters**: (Chen et al. 2021) and (Fekry et al. 2020) emphasize that only a small subset of configuration parameters significantly affect overall performance. (Chen et al. 2021) specifically mentions that only impactful optimizations have noticeable effects on runtime performance.\n\n3. **Configuration Coefficients**: (Ha & Zhang 2019b) found that Fourier coefficients for software performance functions are very sparse, with most coefficients being zero. This indicates that only a few configurations have significant impact.\n\n4. **Configuration Metrics**: (Grohmann et al. 2019) observed that not all platform metrics are relevant for machine learning models, requiring preprocessing to make them useful.\n\nThese examples illustrate that sparsity in configuration data is a common phenomenon across different domains and can be characterized by the limited number of options, parameters, or coefficients that significantly influence performance.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[127,126,129,7,128,132,131,169,210,57,80,125,14,86,22,43,123,130,122,67,121,212,211,27,89,170,23,58,79,223,93,21,49,124,165,225,100,133,146,207,213,9,76,156,2,3,48,92,40,164,251,258,62,155,168,221,35,145,163,217,24,74,228,20,59,95,167,134,222,240,166,202,6,138,151,242,250,136,159,19,64,171,209,139,140,144,238,173,200,45,101,150,203,253,56,105,135,160,176,179,208,243,54,83,120,142,152,174,244,78,88,161,224,61,65,103,153,41,94,147,184,237,30,50,85,87,117,137,183,205,236,77,81,91,245,18,55,143,157,175,241,26,63,119,229,234,246,247,42,51,71,84,90,172,180,204,226,141,191,254,37,158,216,249,256,257,25,29,82,102,239,190,206,227,44,73,197,214,154,235,72,75,96,12,66,70,118,189,230,255,53,104,116,162,177,11,32,99,231,259,39,60,149,260,69,218,220,248,5,8,47,110,148,195,219,97,232,28,114,178,252,52,198,16,192,261,98,181,182,31,13,185,194,201,46,112,233,68,199,215,196,109,15,33,111,108,193,269,115,106,263,187,107,271,272,274,188,1,10,36,265,270,186,264,268,273,17,34,113,262,266,267,38,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"4\n","score":4}]}

(2021) highlight several key differences and potential advantages of using white-box analysis over machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems. White-box analysis, which involves understanding and modeling the underlying mechanisms of the system, offers several advantages:\n\n1. **Interpretability**: White-box models are more interpretable, allowing for a deeper understanding of how different configurations affect performance. This transparency is crucial for debugging and maintaining complex systems.\n\n2. **Explainability**: White-box models can provide clear explanations for performance outcomes, which is essential for stakeholders who need to understand the rationale behind decisions.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: White-box models can be more efficient in terms of computational resources, as they often require less data and can be optimized for specific tasks.\n\n4. **Robustness**: By leveraging the inherent structure of the system, white-box models can be more robust to changes in the environment or system parameters.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: They can be easily adapted to new configurations or scenarios, as the underlying mechanisms are explicitly modeled.\n\n6. **Reduced Overfitting**: White-box models are less prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with limited data, as they focus on the essential features rather than learning noise.\n\n7. **Integration with Other Tools**: They can more seamlessly integrate with other system components and tools, enhancing overall system performance.\n\nThese advantages make white-box analysis particularly suitable for complex and configurable systems where understanding and controlling performance is critical.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[256,211,242,173,212,122,172,23,177,176,180,103,191,86,102,214,96,117,95,258,130,193,251,239,178,209,243,99,19,58,74,101,128,250,132,22,59,231,240,129,65,210,234,40,51,100,213,87,56,85,104,229,246,253,60,61,260,237,144,232,235,245,255,31,151,254,257,54,119,179,236,18,20,45,79,90,157,247,52,55,69,125,148,230,244,53,57,75,116,261,76,94,155,249,63,64,105,123,134,80,67,83,106,127,146,238,2,26,32,72,78,81,88,140,203,223,112,241,49,126,169,204,259,12,68,115,136,252,43,62,66,77,215,248,8,70,84,111,174,200,21,48,156,170,71,124,147,9,29,33,150,166,3,7,168,195,25,98,207,233,14,37,143,153,121,189,192,197,5,208,222,224,82,113,152,199,225,227,92,110,137,139,161,220,226,30,44,50,97,108,202,47,131,145,186,194,114,142,163,167,175,228,107,109,120,149,184,188,41,185,11,15,133,138,162,165,190,263,91,24,181,196,274,13,118,154,158,160,217,73,135,164,264,27,39,42,89,201,159,46,187,28,183,216,218,221,6,171,93,182,35,198,141,206,267,273,205,1,219,266,271,4,262,38,265,36,272,16,269,268,10,34,270,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

For instance, the WHISPER prototype, designed to nudge users back into conversations by providing audio narratives, can lead to users feeling disturbed or frustrated if the intervention is perceived as intrusive. This can create a negative experience, even if the intention was to improve interaction quality. The thesis also notes that the quality of social interactions is a subjective phenomenon, making it challenging to measure objectively. Previous studies have used metrics like conversation volume and gaze direction, but these methods are subjective and may not fully capture the nuanced aspects of social interaction quality.\n\nThe design implications and research directions presented in the thesis emphasize the importance of considering these unintended outcomes and the complexity of measuring social interaction quality. The thesis suggests that future research should focus on developing more comprehensive and objective methods for measuring social interaction quality, taking into account subjective elements and the potential for unintended consequences. This involves exploring new technologies and methodologies that can accurately assess the impact of interventions without compromising the natural flow and quality of social interactions.","source":"data/test/2405.13465.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[133,4,131,132,91,135,136,137,81,16,134,21,89,22,17,92,126,149,44,54,60,79,87,53,106,20,104,61,111,83,76,108,36,7,45,42,82,107,41,19,52,90,34,43,124,88,125,29,59,112,47,110,138,37,39,49,14,38,93,120,50,140,95,146,18,64,121,141,148,84,58,27,32,9,46,69,129,130,15,62,66,127,68,103,25,109,35,67,31,11,1,8,26,48,94,100,28,5,150,65,85,117,147,57,55,70,30,116,123,56,128,33,51,122,119,143,2,23,144,155,13,105,71,102,139,157,86,145,63,142,6,96,12,73,156,80,118,40,78,98,101,153,115,152,75,72,74,77,99,24,97,151,3,154,10,114,113],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

They should clearly communicate how data is used and ensure users have control over their data.  This includes providing options for users to opt-out of data collection or view the data collected.  Additionally, designers should prioritize user privacy by minimizing data collection and only using it for the intended purpose of enriching social interactions.  They should also avoid creating artificial interactions by designing systems that feel natural and intuitive, rather than overtly nudging users.  This can be achieved through subtle, context-aware nudges rather than overtly intrusive interventions.  Finally, designers should foster a sense of trust by involving users in the design process and demonstrating their commitment to ethical design practices.

{"question":"How does Fisker's new dealer partnership model aim to create a \"win-win-win\" situation, and what potential challenges might arise in implementing this strategy?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[14],"raw_output":"","pred":"Fisker's new dealer partnership model aims to create a \"win-win-win\" situation by offering a no-haggle pricing model, transparent sales experience, and improved access to vehicle test drives, delivery, and service. This model benefits customers by providing a straightforward purchasing process, dealers by expanding their market reach with minimal upfront capital investment, and Fisker by accelerating vehicle deliveries and preparing for future product launches.\n\nHowever, implementing this strategy faces several potential challenges. First, the success of the dealer partnership model depends on the quality and reliability of the dealers, which may require significant oversight and training. Fisker must ensure that dealers meet high customer satisfaction standards, which could be difficult to monitor and enforce across a wide network. Second, the model's scalability and efficiency may be hindered by the complexity of managing multiple dealerships, especially in a rapidly growing market. Third, maintaining a consistent customer experience across different dealerships could be challenging, requiring robust support systems and clear guidelines. Finally, the financial viability of the dealers, particularly those in the conservative premium segment, may be uncertain, potentially impacting the overall success of the partnership.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FSR_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[14,7,60,8,13,31,9,62,21,61,17,4,26,6,22,15,41,12,82,25,18,59,126,475,11,238,74,235,404,421,10,35,253,439,16,23,338,494,37,38,490,63,122,125,507,19,47,249,27,103,316,331,418,435,46,198,28,33,344,412,497,397,5,80,436,30,326,1,3,77,78,131,193,231,188,379,56,94,124,310,34,68,79,500,43,114,189,318,476,24,29,311,452,504,44,104,260,39,50,55,199,240,90,111,36,57,179,42,112,127,191,237,313,501,48,53,71,101,274,341,415,491,66,128,152,168,354,40,49,73,117,123,217,290,315,336,349,368,370,380,32,45,138,455,492,51,67,105,110,129,137,234,355,20,167,228,296,446,471,511,58,102,113,174,178,192,196,236,252,300,314,325,329,337,343,396,407,414,420,434,438,456,466,489,499,503,2,52,64,65,83,100,247,289,356,410,416,472,87,130,230,259,267,393,408,98,99,219,277,306,308,335,383,389,403,411,450,54,70,116,155,184,283,324,394,409,413,461,470,505,220,223,248,353,366,405,425,460,464,468,495,161,225,243,293,378,457,463,86,139,171,181,257,261,303,431,145,351,391,437,448,72,186,352,374,377,443,75,97,121,342,345,392,440,453,493,91,173,270,295,321,363,367,417,451,454,488,506,147,157,222,279,301,350,365,422,424,134,140,162,185,284,309,332,400,442,502,85,172,294,348,375,445,447,135,245,254,273,334,361,384,386,388,109,160,187,281,282,307,323,426,427,477,159,165,176,177,287,298,299,398,458,473,84,164,197,256,291,358,150,170,206,262,346,359,399,118,158,207,272,280,292,467,498,89,136,210,233,269,357,151,246,285,69,88,106,153,169,258,373,402,462,221,286,322,390,423,360,382,441,107,144,149,263,266,271,288,362,369,433,487,496,509,93,200,229,241,244,319,339,372,395,429,76,108,120,132,208,304,317,333,364,474,148,226,406,449,141,154,163,203,387,92,218,242,275,381,401,444,508,142,209,232,264,428,133,227,302,182,305,430,143,146,224,265,371,432,255,268,320,376,156,201,215,96,211,276,278,385,166,183,205,216,419,459,175,297,465,202,212,180,194,347,510,213,214,330,119,204,328,469,239,312,480,115,190,250,340,81,479,478,95,482,481,483,485,484,486,327,195,251],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Specifically, the breach could result in the acceleration of the debt, making it due and payable prior to its stated maturity. This acceleration could trigger a default, leading to potential legal actions, financial penalties, and reputational damage. Additionally, the company might be required to redeem the debt at a higher price, increasing its financial burden.\n\nRegarding Event of Default Notices, the company is obligated to deliver written notices to the Holder and the Trustee within two Business Days of the occurrence of an Event of Default. This obligation is independent of the Trustee's duty to deliver such notices. The company's failure to timely deliver these notices could result in the Holder exercising their redemption rights, potentially leading to the early redemption of the debt. This highlights the importance of timely communication and compliance with contractual obligations to mitigate financial risks and maintain good standing with creditors and investors.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FSR_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[143,265,217,177,299,144,266,288,244,257,140,160,322,262,282,158,228,280,218,286,457,166,176,254,415,401,459,164,298,465,141,219,263,451,461,468,135,376,132,277,155,223,221,319,153,258,292,399,136,145,159,220,243,281,428,450,442,208,275,352,460,157,205,279,373,181,267,285,134,163,170,196,224,256,308,432,146,276,391,186,230,241,268,347,364,371,383,382,462,53,137,232,303,385,398,496,211,260,274,291,393,427,139,152,261,169,247,304,494,67,129,154,161,216,229,283,324,455,138,182,201,334,396,464,466,183,377,54,259,321,349,433,389,431,492,209,306,333,380,425,429,184,246,269,305,368,424,472,226,365,400,471,507,83,210,360,384,388,112,156,171,245,278,335,386,394,417,443,469,46,49,293,323,372,379,491,45,114,151,174,222,264,289,336,130,255,374,375,392,470,133,147,296,390,402,416,441,473,234,273,307,325,240,309,318,350,354,430,463,508,98,101,117,142,214,361,395,411,421,453,467,495,32,100,165,185,212,215,227,287,367,24,353,356,369,370,378,381,426,449,493,20,42,51,344,345,351,410,456,490,90,167,187,206,337,355,434,440,116,366,387,162,203,233,284,362,454,37,150,272,359,363,409,239,131,148,301,302,403,439,18,33,50,199,270,458,26,204,253,290,320,30,127,128,149,242,271,446,448,225,502,40,102,110,172,202,294,74,168,179,238,346,357,509,52,84,86,191,207,213,231,313,332,47,76,188,197,504,48,317,2,25,55,75,310,510,19,91,198,66,34,87,189,311,70,316,38,41,97,99,331,348,397,180,200,56,423,452,61,111,173,178,295,300,28,69,444,27,44,93,124,358,4,29,43,113,408,57,22,39,104,447,31,36,88,445,95,107,412,1,35,89,103,109,126,249,3,5,64,85,68,81,94,105,175,297,312,505,59,115,119,474,12,23,190,404,405,413,422,82,96,17,71,123,6,8,118,195,65,120,248,315,338,14,193,235,506,62,121,63,125,237,60,92,194,78,330,106,435,9,21,80,13,58,73,406,501,475,7,122,328,11,480,497,77,251,419,16,72,418,326,108,483,486,10,339,436,498,477,484,503,342,487,79,481,327,500,15,479,482,340,478,437,488,250,476,485,511,192,236,252,314,329,343,407,414,420,438,489,499,341],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Firstly, the company experienced a significant increase in deferred tax assets, particularly in the areas of deferred compensation, accrued expenses, and net operating loss and other carryforwards. Specifically, deferred compensation increased from $19,344 thousand to $20,310 thousand, accrued expenses from $23,434 thousand to $26,811 thousand, and net operating loss and other carryforwards from $540,443 thousand to $531,257 thousand. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities, particularly in the areas of property and equipment and right-of-use operating lease assets.\n\nThese changes in net deferred income tax assets could impact the company's future financial position in several ways. On one hand, the increase in deferred tax assets suggests that the company has more future tax benefits that can be utilized, which could reduce future tax expenses and potentially improve cash flow. This could lead to a more favorable tax position and potentially lower the effective tax rate.\n\nHowever, the substantial increase in deferred compensation and accrued expenses might indicate higher future tax liabilities if these expenses are not fully utilized or if there are changes in tax laws. Additionally, the large carryforwards could be subject to expiration or utilization constraints, affecting the actual tax savings.\n\nOverall, while the increase might provide short-term benefits, it also requires careful management to ensure that the deferred assets are realized and that the company remains compliant with tax regulations to avoid future penalties.","source":"data/test/NYSE_OII_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[46,79,77,80,67,44,40,26,45,52,73,66,88,84,68,65,41,85,28,39,43,50,47,49,70,24,3,14,71,83,15,94,21,64,82,38,93,22,30,25,27,78,76,90,51,53,92,87,17,23,29,89,54,69,91,8,11,31,56,75,6,10,18,58,81,48,62,72,12,19,42,4,36,63,74,86,35,59,57,60,33,20,13,32,1,5,95,2,16,61,55,9,7,34,37,96],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This reclassification would have several adverse tax consequences. Firstly, the Operating Partnership would be taxed as a corporation rather than a partnership, which could significantly increase its tax liability. Secondly, the company's ability to distribute income to its shareholders would be impacted. As a REIT, the company is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders to avoid excise taxes. If the Operating Partnership were reclassified, the company might face higher corporate taxes, reducing the amount of cash available for distributions.\n\nMoreover, the reclassification could affect the company's capital structure and financial flexibility. The company might need to borrow additional funds or sell assets to meet its tax obligations, which could strain its financial resources. Additionally, the company's management might be required to make taxable distributions of its shares or debt securities to shareholders, further impacting its cash flow and ability to maintain distributions.

{"question":"How does Hillenbrand's approach to establishing reserves for different types of claims, such as those covered by insurance versus other claims, differ, and what factors contribute to this difference in methodology?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[118],"raw_output":"","pred":"Hillenbrand establishes reserves for different types of claims using distinct methodologies based on the nature and coverage of the claims. For claims covered by insurance, the company relies on outside insurance companies and third-party claims administrators to assist in establishing individual claim reserves. An independent outside actuary often provides estimates of ultimate projected losses, including incurred but not reported claims, which are used to establish these reserves. This approach leverages external expertise and standardized processes to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\nIn contrast, for other types of claims, reserves are established when payment is considered probable and are based on advice from internal and external counsel and historical settlement information. This method relies more heavily on internal expertise and historical data to estimate potential losses, as external insurance coverage is not available.\n\nThe difference in methodology stems from the availability of insurance coverage and the need for specialized expertise. Claims covered by insurance benefit from the structured and standardized processes of insurance companies and actuaries, while other claims require a more tailored approach based on legal advice and historical data. This distinction ensures that Hillenbrand can effectively manage its financial exposure to various types of claims, balancing the use of external expertise with internal knowledge and historical insights.","source":"data/test/NYSE_HI_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[118,81,117,32,45,61,98,25,17,101,128,129,51,52,106,121,95,97,53,103,12,46,62,13,68,75,77,112,127,122,125,8,82,11,23,93,26,91,33,44,76,134,2,66,1,20,21,4,72,87,22,73,131,74,99,135,89,126,5,15,48,9,100,114,65,132,79,43,10,80,70,85,42,58,19,34,14,49,36,47,50,119,40,41,104,96,105,83,84,110,54,102,107,57,124,31,37,39,60,35,56,27,30,38,92,111,71,63,90,109,113,59,123,6,55,86,78,88,115,24,94,116,69,29,28,16,67,120,7,108,3,64,18,133,130],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This ensures that executives are motivated to achieve not only financial but also environmental and social objectives.\n\nThese measures contribute to the company's sustainability strategy by fostering a culture of accountability and performance alignment, ensuring that executive decisions and actions are aligned with the company's long-term goals and societal responsibilities.","source":"data/test/NYSE_EHC_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,29,52,10,30,11,12,47,177,9,31,93,208,210,218,7,36,61,169,5,88,187,155,174,219,190,196,216,1,72,80,92,109,186,194,81,141,188,192,221,8,172,189,197,222,184,201,28,87,139,217,62,191,203,214,2,120,209,211,173,193,207,176,178,199,200,17,34,78,82,185,213,16,175,183,198,215,48,180,182,202,212,148,179,19,195,204,13,166,59,205,27,3,206,53,75,98,181,84,49,56,94,97,51,50,54,77,99,118,133,33,66,142,58,96,23,60,70,38,76,95,164,154,146,150,152,42,144,32,46,115,135,151,35,22,67,116,136,89,100,117,140,18,123,25,71,104,57,63,132,24,73,111,101,157,55,153,161,40,83,128,4,43,90,121,127,143,149,159,162,39,74,103,114,125,138,160,37,110,107,129,41,156,45,21,44,102,106,130,20,68,108,119,122,64,126,14,171,105,113,134,170,65,145,69,85,86,91,131,220,79,124,147,112,167,165,163,168,26,137,15,158],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

A shift towards renewable energy sources could increase costs and reduce operational efficiency, potentially impacting profitability. Additionally, the company's ability to maintain its operations could be disrupted if energy supply becomes unreliable or if energy prices rise sharply.\n\nFurthermore, Encompass Health's operations are vulnerable to climate-related risks such as extreme weather events, which could lead to increased costs for disaster recovery and business continuity planning. The company may also need to invest in alternative energy sources or technologies that are not yet reliable or cost-effective, further straining its financial resources.\n\nConsumer, investor, and lender pressure to change business models and practices could lead to operational disruptions and increased costs. Subsidies from the federal government for renewable energy might not offset these increased costs, potentially exacerbating the financial burden.

A rising interest rate environment would increase their variable-rate debt payments, potentially impacting cash flow and profitability.  Conversely, a falling interest rate environment would reduce variable-rate payments but increase the cost of refinancing fixed-rate debt.  This creates a \"hedge\" effect, where rising rates benefit variable-rate debt holders and fixed-rate debt holders, while falling rates benefit fixed-rate debt holders and hurt variable-rate debt holders.\n\nHHH mitigates this risk through interest rate swaps and caps.  These derivatives allow them to lock in interest rates on a portion of their variable-rate debt, reducing the impact of rate fluctuations on their cash flows.

The increase in net sales and gross profit, despite higher expenses and taxes, suggests that the company was able to manage its costs effectively and maintain a positive financial outlook.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[51,49,48,43,47,50,90,44,72,26,70,54,82,97,69,2,52,77,88,91,66,86,80,73,81,55,53,75,78,65,13,95,29,67,74,14,92,96,8,34,84,68,93,32,94,98,41,46,56,60,76,39,79,33,62,89,71,6,9,99,18,19,21,87,31,64,12,45,61,30,25,83,85,3,23,35,58,22,59,16,5,27,37,100,110,38,57,40,42,1,28,104,7,36,101,107,20,15,24,106,103,11,4,108,109,102,105,10,17,63],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Specifically, the number of active customers decreased from 3,821 to 3,761, a decline of 1.5%. This indicates a slight reduction in customer base over the two-year period. Similarly, net sales per active customer decreased from $340 to $306, a decline of 10.6%. This suggests that while the company retains its customer base, it is experiencing a decrease in average spending per customer.\n\nThese trends might impact the company's strategic decisions in several ways. The company may need to focus on increasing customer engagement and retention strategies to reverse the decline in net sales per active customer. This could involve enhancing customer loyalty programs, improving product offerings, or implementing more effective marketing campaigns. Additionally, the company might explore ways to attract new customers to offset the loss in average spending per existing customer. \n\nStrategically, the company could also consider optimizing its inventory management to reduce markdowns and improve profitability. Furthermore, investing in digital marketing and e-commerce platforms could help in expanding the customer base and increasing online sales, which might be less affected by the overall decline in average spending.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[43,47,49,45,21,79,81,51,95,32,89,2,62,52,67,64,93,66,82,94,56,41,78,44,83,65,12,80,91,39,90,61,96,72,88,42,46,99,40,69,73,29,16,86,97,98,34,70,5,48,11,13,68,76,6,28,53,33,100,104,84,8,50,14,54,58,60,74,3,24,77,19,92,22,59,9,35,38,57,71,26,85,55,75,37,20,23,25,27,31,103,107,18,10,15,30,63,87,7,101,106,110,36,1,105,17,4,108,102,109],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Prior to the IPO, the incentive units were accounted for as in-substance liabilities, reflecting their economic substance rather than their legal form. This was due to the units' lack of voting rights, distribution rights, and the repurchase feature, which allowed Torrid Holding LLC to repurchase vested units at fair value upon termination. The valuation of these units used a contingent claims analysis (CCA) methodology based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model (OPM), incorporating assumptions like equity volatility and risk-free interest rates.\n\nIn contrast, post-IPO, Torrid's share-based compensation plans, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs), are accounted for as equity instruments. These plans provide equity ownership to employees, with RSUs vesting over four years and PSUs based on performance targets and market conditions. The fair value of these awards is determined using the Black-Scholes OPM, reflecting the economic rights associated with the awards.\n\nThe key factors driving this difference are the economic substance of the pre-IPO incentive units, their lack of equity ownership features, and the legal obligation of Torrid Holding LLC to repurchase them. Post-IPO, the equity ownership features of the compensation plans align with the accounting treatment of equity instruments.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[92,77,76,90,60,68,91,96,59,66,67,84,55,69,72,50,70,86,41,2,82,65,52,104,85,51,61,13,48,75,49,62,43,10,11,64,35,103,5,44,58,47,3,15,78,88,95,34,46,54,6,53,56,57,106,73,93,28,45,74,40,29,32,80,83,110,81,87,94,1,22,101,33,39,97,8,12,14,19,71,89,38,99,16,9,21,7,25,18,42,79,98,26,31,23,36,30,105,37,24,27,20,100,107,102,63,109,4,108,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The sharp decline in Sunnova's stock could be attributed to factors like financial difficulties, operational challenges, or investor concerns.\n\n3. **Industry Trends**: The solar ETF's performance might be more aligned with broader industry trends and technological advancements in solar energy, which could have provided stability compared to Sunnova's more volatile path.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment towards Sunnova, influenced by news and market rumors, could have significantly impacted its stock price, leading to the observed volatility.\n\nOverall, while the NYSE Composite and Invesco Solar ETF offer broader market and industry perspectives, Sunnova's stock performance reflects more nuanced and specific market dynamics.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NOVA_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[64,68,84,120,11,66,9,1,7,93,140,13,85,97,99,72,108,161,95,113,160,17,101,157,158,58,162,21,32,127,129,33,52,102,141,156,125,152,83,88,130,78,105,110,14,20,30,67,40,73,80,159,3,75,119,128,151,69,70,26,94,149,45,65,4,25,133,115,132,24,81,147,10,18,123,90,103,135,63,79,136,74,112,86,148,91,16,28,131,150,53,76,96,109,138,144,60,117,154,107,134,34,89,104,122,37,54,137,164,106,51,87,124,46,118,142,82,116,143,43,55,114,29,41,153,5,23,36,39,42,71,126,61,62,44,146,15,139,19,77,27,48,145,6,12,100,111,8,22,38,35,163,98,50,57,31,47,56,59,49,121,155,2,92],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Net metering policies, which allow customers to receive credit for excess electricity generated by their solar systems, are crucial for the company's business model.  Changes to these policies, such as reductions in credit rates or caps on installed capacity, could reduce the attractiveness of solar energy systems to customers, thereby limiting the company's ability to originate new solar service agreements.  This would directly impact revenue growth and profitability.\n\nSimilarly, the availability and value of financial incentives, such as rebates and tax credits, are essential for offsetting the high initial costs of solar systems.  Changes in these incentives, including expiration, elimination, or reduction, could make solar energy less competitive compared to traditional energy sources, further hindering the company's growth.  The company relies on these incentives to attract customers and maintain its market position.  Therefore, any reduction in their effectiveness or availability could significantly undermine the company's ability to expand its customer base and achieve its growth objectives.\n","source":"data/test/NYSE_NOVA_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[44,45,5,33,26,22,29,38,73,27,39,21,41,43,23,4,3,60,59,16,51,72,25,37,58,61,74,47,53,50,52,49,6,36,48,19,46,54,57,42,101,65,24,56,18,17,30,40,91,7,15,35,55,94,31,64,80,88,90,32,66,28,75,89,63,115,34,62,68,84,97,125,13,20,126,138,79,102,108,141,153,12,82,106,131,8,71,99,83,103,154,76,87,109,128,148,78,93,70,98,104,124,96,137,9,11,112,118,147,10,69,85,95,110,129,67,107,122,123,151,144,114,120,134,119,127,133,81,105,139,142,113,130,132,135,77,117,162,1,111,136,146,92,161,14,86,152,143,150,121,100,116,159,160,163,158,2,155,145,149,140,156,157,164],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Firstly, in December 2023, Sunnova admitted three tax equity investors with a total capital commitment of approximately $463.0 million, and in February 2024, it admitted an additional tax equity investor with a capital commitment of approximately $195.0 million. These tax equity investments are crucial for funding the expansion of Sunnova's operations and supporting its growth by providing capital without diluting existing shareholders' equity.\n\nSecondly, Sunnova amended its revolving credit facilities with Atlas Securitized Products Holdings, L.P., increasing the aggregate commitment amount from $769.3 million to $1.309 billion in October 2023 and further increasing it to $1.311 billion in December 2023. These amendments reflect the company's ability to secure additional financing, which is essential for managing its liquidity and supporting its operations.\n\nLastly, Sunnova entered into a revolving credit facility with Mitsubishi HC Capital America, Inc., in December 2023, providing an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million. This facility is available to finance project costs related to commercial, industrial, and other solar energy systems and energy storage systems, further enhancing Sunnova's financial flexibility and ability to invest in new projects.\n\nThese actions collectively demonstrate Sunnova's commitment to securing the necessary capital to sustain and expand its operations, thereby positioning the company for continued growth and market leadership in the solar energy sector.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NOVA_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[120,128,66,125,21,84,97,148,162,130,132,20,68,123,151,13,99,9,26,73,95,127,3,11,17,25,101,161,129,1,113,138,157,160,75,141,158,14,85,159,10,149,24,4,72,108,133,80,39,64,86,140,156,96,150,83,52,131,33,78,93,110,152,16,61,74,88,102,124,41,45,164,115,27,29,46,67,40,147,22,23,114,7,58,82,90,28,112,37,38,87,91,5,32,65,79,30,54,60,105,118,126,139,53,70,94,103,119,154,163,19,18,42,76,117,144,81,89,109,51,142,34,43,44,57,98,116,6,63,71,106,122,59,69,143,12,35,55,62,107,146,104,134,15,36,47,137,50,100,135,8,31,48,77,136,56,145,49,153,121,111,155,2,92],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

What factors might have driven this change, and what are the potential financial reporting implications of this shift?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[99],"raw_output":"","pred":"Oscar Health shifted its reinsurance accounting from deposit accounting to quota share reinsurance accounting in 2023. This change was driven by the termination of a quota share reinsurance contract that had been in place for the 2022 policy year and the subsequent entry into a new quota share arrangement for the 2023 policy year.\n\nThe shift from deposit accounting to quota share reinsurance accounting has significant financial reporting implications. Under deposit accounting, reinsurance premiums ceded are recorded as a liability, reflecting the company's obligation to pay the reinsurer. In contrast, quota share reinsurance accounting recognizes the ceded premiums as revenue and the ceded claims as expenses, which can affect the company's reported income and cash flows.\n\nThis change likely reflects a strategic decision to better align the company's financial reporting with its risk management practices and to potentially improve the predictability of its earnings. By adopting quota share reinsurance accounting, Oscar Health may be able to more accurately reflect the true cost of its reinsurance arrangements, leading to more transparent and reliable financial statements. This could enhance investor confidence and provide clearer insights into the company's financial health and risk management strategies.","source":"data/test/NYSE_OSCR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[71,63,33,118,94,65,84,64,89,13,16,8,49,81,85,25,130,18,72,74,62,109,87,121,32,120,122,3,86,7,9,98,119,126,127,91,19,88,4,5,76,78,69,92,110,12,95,6,50,75,40,73,96,1,17,48,15,30,53,125,41,24,77,128,10,66,54,28,68,67,20,38,100,31,47,56,82,105,114,113,29,107,131,60,70,99,37,58,102,106,11,42,111,115,14,123,124,97,21,35,39,55,34,44,61,117,43,79,45,116,104,27,93,132,2,101,26,52,46,83,57,108,36,59,103,23,112,22,51,129,90,80],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

If the completion factors are too low, the company may underestimate the ultimate claim expense, leading to insufficient reserves and potentially resulting in future periods having to recognize additional benefit expense. Conversely, if the completion factors are too high, the company may overestimate the ultimate claim expense, causing unnecessary reserves and potentially reducing reported profits. This misalignment between estimated and actual claims can lead to fluctuations in reported healthcare costs, impacting the company's financial statements and investor perception.\n\nThe impact on reported healthcare costs is particularly pronounced because healthcare costs are a significant component of the company's expenses. Underestimating claims can lead to unexpected increases in healthcare costs in future periods, while overestimating claims can result in higher reported expenses in the current period. This variability can create uncertainty in the company's financial projections and may affect its ability to manage cash flow effectively. Additionally, inaccuracies in completion factors can lead to misreporting of profitability, potentially affecting the company's stock price and investor confidence.

These items are subtracted from Adjusted EBITDA to arrive at Net Income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders.\n\nIn contrast, for reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, the company includes all of the above non-cash items, but also adds back capital expenditures. This results in a higher figure for Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities compared to Net Income. The capital expenditures are considered a non-cash use of funds, which is reflected in the operating cash flow but not in the net income calculation.\n\nThis difference highlights the company's focus on cash flow generation and its operational performance, emphasizing the importance of capital expenditures in understanding the company's financial health and ability to generate cash from its core business activities.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MTDR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[126,212,213,120,123,127,163,211,124,171,178,179,90,214,149,166,172,34,118,72,82,176,130,180,145,170,28,140,161,188,202,16,156,167,196,204,60,114,146,174,192,198,2,116,128,147,164,190,200,18,108,160,112,162,20,22,206,66,131,4,19,148,26,32,136,182,36,109,142,144,184,40,177,201,113,138,30,155,96,165,46,24,119,194,17,84,168,210,74,158,64,68,110,197,70,117,38,111,185,85,125,209,122,217,11,15,205,5,27,50,115,135,181,8,78,102,121,129,87,183,14,137,199,37,41,54,98,62,88,35,133,58,104,186,3,29,169,173,191,195,134,157,189,25,65,175,21,31,71,86,132,154,193,203,7,48,52,56,76,187,218,23,44,57,208,33,94,152,42,80,39,69,99,77,100,55,67,207,12,13,1,47,59,91,93,97,9,73,139,63,92,81,150,43,151,159,53,6,105,106,143,79,107,75,83,101,51,216,49,89,153,45,95,103,10,141,61,215],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This substantial decrease in net income, combined with the repurchase and retirement of common shares, led to a reduction in retained earnings from $127,826,000 to $211,881,000. Additionally, the company issued common shares for delivery of share-based awards, which contributed to the increase in additional paid-in capital from $226,514,000 to $231,332,000.\n\nThese factors collectively impacted the overall financial position of Masonite International Corporation by reducing its equity base. The decrease in retained earnings and the repurchase of shares indicated a reduction in the company's retained earnings available for future investments or dividends. However, the issuance of common shares for share-based awards helped mitigate some of the negative impact on equity. Overall, the company's financial position was affected by a net loss in 2023, despite some positive contributions from share-based awards and equity issuance.","source":"data/test/NYSE_DOOR_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[55,60,108,41,59,48,42,43,62,34,82,47,61,121,38,93,50,36,81,45,104,53,92,44,72,39,51,96,63,40,49,116,73,3,86,46,76,58,80,99,35,102,103,129,85,52,88,105,130,97,68,56,101,37,75,26,100,83,78,87,131,117,90,106,128,22,74,114,132,1,98,122,133,19,6,79,20,77,115,2,91,89,14,125,11,70,94,84,118,15,17,69,57,23,127,95,111,4,28,33,65,31,66,126,119,124,13,18,112,12,7,21,32,123,25,9,27,67,54,137,24,64,109,136,30,110,8,29,5,107,10,71,16,134,135,120,113],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

These reductions reflect the resolution of certain tax positions that were no longer subject to audit or the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n\nOverall, the increase in unrecognized tax benefits was influenced by the addition of new and prior-year tax positions, while the reductions due to settlements and the lapse of the statute of limitations helped to mitigate the impact on the overall balance.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AYI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[76,74,75,59,45,58,56,61,60,48,53,40,64,24,25,51,9,52,70,43,71,41,22,21,54,49,73,17,50,65,63,101,23,67,145,15,29,47,79,42,46,201,26,34,37,6,8,35,55,69,12,118,188,19,44,148,30,57,107,16,66,72,100,164,190,205,27,129,4,28,117,163,175,200,10,128,217,32,62,206,77,174,13,38,189,216,20,84,218,33,36,80,7,94,102,116,130,191,193,104,112,132,220,232,1,31,81,119,144,162,178,192,235,241,125,153,176,240,242,14,99,131,139,185,98,159,168,177,204,215,227,68,92,97,141,150,165,173,213,214,219,239,244,85,122,127,146,179,223,224,238,5,93,135,142,211,231,233,18,39,91,181,83,126,133,136,143,172,182,113,138,248,171,207,111,86,158,169,184,11,187,221,230,78,82,134,147,156,180,209,212,222,247,103,106,110,120,170,199,226,96,124,140,166,194,210,236,157,183,237,123,196,228,2,137,90,186,109,198,3,114,115,121,161,167,208,256,108,160,243,245,251,154,155,249,253,202,254,197,203,252,95,259,229,246,250,257,89,225,258,255,87,105,149,234,260,151,195,261,88,152],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Acuity Brands, being a lighting and building technology company, likely faced reduced demand and supply chain disruptions during this time.\n\n2. **Market Sentiment**: The building materials sector may have been seen as more resilient during the pandemic, with increased demand for home improvements and renovations.

In 2021, the percentage of revenues from related party transactions was 2.5%.\n2. In 2022, this percentage increased to 3.0%.\n3. In 2023, it further increased to 3.4%.\n\nThis trend indicates a gradual increase in the proportion of revenues derived from related party transactions over the three-year period. While the absolute values of related party revenues are relatively small compared to total revenues (ranging from RMB 70.4 million to RMB 52.7 million), the percentage of total revenues attributed to these transactions has grown from 2.5% to 3.4%.\n\nThis increase suggests that Cheetah Mobile Inc. has become slightly more reliant on related party transactions as a source of revenue over the years. However, it's important to note that these related party transactions are relatively minor in scale compared to the company's overall operations. The company's primary revenue sources remain its internet business and AI and others segments, which account for the vast majority of its total revenues.\n\nThe trend could indicate that Cheetah Mobile Inc. has been expanding its relationships with related parties, potentially through strategic partnerships or acquisitions, to enhance its business operations or access new markets. However, the overall reliance on related parties remains low, suggesting that the company's core business is still primarily driven by its core internet and AI services.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[149,190,92,148,12,160,176,206,13,163,174,185,205,154,155,157,167,97,184,191,207,152,153,159,11,146,161,165,181,200,204,178,180,195,196,203,142,171,175,193,156,169,170,182,194,162,183,177,186,189,151,168,202,58,98,187,192,201,172,199,286,6,24,91,145,188,198,166,14,287,57,158,7,101,147,150,173,179,19,164,4,8,121,197,93,116,1,113,27,35,281,282,265,283,285,133,284,288,246,258,293,117,126,115,118,140,255,135,51,249,25,56,90,15,61,263,28,62,264,95,37,22,232,119,17,59,136,138,16,99,107,20,280,266,94,104,10,102,130,276,38,44,89,141,143,103,257,105,253,261,63,131,23,49,96,110,60,33,216,220,64,85,86,34,209,111,5,26,36,109,272,45,3,21,228,88,230,208,40,47,73,83,210,18,129,132,30,48,231,237,239,31,39,42,128,134,247,9,55,240,248,46,114,217,291,65,70,100,124,269,106,120,229,256,278,72,221,238,32,43,267,41,241,271,218,29,50,81,137,52,80,211,259,279,84,123,213,233,243,290,2,108,270,219,227,67,71,78,125,234,260,74,252,273,69,82,268,289,144,274,66,122,250,68,79,223,87,225,75,77,214,245,292,275,53,127,212,254,244,277,76,112,224,235,54,242,139,226,215,222,251,236,294,262],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

The depositary bank, which manages the ADSs, charges fees for various services, such as the issuance of ADSs, the conversion of ADSs into ordinary shares, and the conversion of ordinary shares into ADSs. These fees can range from $10 to $25 per transaction, depending on the specific service. Additionally, there are fees associated with the conversion of ordinary shares into ADSs, which can be up to $10 per transaction.\n\nCurrency conversion is another significant factor. Investors must convert their local currency into U.S. dollars to purchase ADSs, and vice versa for redemptions. This process involves currency exchange rates, which can fluctuate and affect the value of the investment. The fees for currency conversion can be up to 1.5% of the amount converted, and there may be additional fees for currency transfers.\n\nThese fees and currency conversion can impact the overall value of an investor's investment. For instance, if the currency conversion fees are substantial, they can reduce the net amount of the investment. Furthermore, fluctuations in currency exchange rates can lead to gains or losses, affecting the investment's performance. Therefore, investors should consider these costs and potential currency risks when evaluating the overall return on their investment in ADSs.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,55,52,126,51,119,127,175,9,10,4,177,33,123,174,169,15,124,122,159,162,203,28,200,27,47,38,8,50,54,125,56,57,118,163,44,204,170,11,17,142,164,168,176,167,189,196,35,121,130,165,197,145,161,115,120,179,207,173,158,37,148,202,157,178,160,166,172,149,150,151,186,22,191,16,93,147,188,199,12,180,194,152,192,39,190,206,154,182,156,181,187,205,21,36,88,184,18,25,32,193,195,201,40,153,171,42,198,41,1,63,34,46,146,155,183,31,104,29,106,20,24,114,62,143,26,49,105,19,67,81,185,45,91,30,92,267,102,103,248,58,76,258,2,131,23,86,97,5,87,111,66,109,80,82,84,98,117,53,70,85,101,257,61,59,64,133,256,65,100,129,268,220,230,241,3,128,221,247,95,289,290,68,75,78,99,132,269,94,210,250,282,209,271,281,43,60,110,211,240,249,278,288,71,108,219,265,279,83,141,229,291,116,266,69,89,90,112,264,138,259,285,232,212,218,270,74,293,238,231,77,96,107,251,7,134,135,216,233,79,213,260,73,239,286,223,292,136,208,237,246,255,13,113,252,284,14,217,222,243,6,72,228,234,273,283,272,242,287,137,263,262,277,144,245,275,280,214,139,294,236,224,253,215,235,140,227,261,226,254,276,244,274,225],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This was offset by the flow-through method, which added 0.6% to the effective tax rate.\n\nIn 2022, the effective tax rate dropped to -0.3%, largely due to the elimination of production tax credits, which had a 7.2% reduction effect on the federal statutory rate. The flow-through method contributed a 0.2% increase to the effective tax rate.\n\nIn 2023, the effective tax rate increased to 3.7%, primarily due to the reinstatement of production tax credits, which added 5.1% to the federal statutory rate. The flow-through method contributed a 12.9% reduction to the effective tax rate.\n\nOverall, the reinstatement and elimination of production tax credits significantly impacted the effective tax rate, with the flow-through method playing a minor role in the fluctuations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NWE_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[111,61,97,113,60,112,63,52,59,53,65,98,118,127,72,100,104,120,7,123,58,119,3,9,33,67,121,40,6,51,117,62,124,4,14,46,96,37,54,68,92,10,105,107,114,30,69,110,99,57,101,108,125,64,109,42,71,22,41,70,21,23,55,66,75,126,87,102,116,45,56,95,25,39,103,134,136,94,90,132,5,8,31,34,129,74,91,2,44,29,81,89,133,36,115,1,122,86,18,20,24,28,32,130,26,38,88,128,43,77,35,11,50,76,106,79,93,17,80,12,84,48,78,131,15,47,137,16,83,85,49,135,27,73,82,138,13,19],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

As of December 31, 2023, the fair value was $424.5 million, while in 2022, it was $374.2 million.

The chloride process uses chlorine to extract rutile TiO2 from slag or rutile ore, producing less waste and requiring less energy and labor compared to the sulfate process. This makes the chloride process more efficient and less labor-intensive. The sulfate process, on the other hand, uses sulfuric acid to extract TiO2 from ilmenite ore, resulting in a warmer undertone.\n\nThe chloride process is preferred for coatings and plastics due to its ability to produce a product with a blueish undertone, which is ideal for these applications. In contrast, the sulfate process is favored for paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, where a warmer undertone is more suitable. The sulfate process also generates higher profit margins for these applications.\n\nThese differences in production methods and end-use suitability reflect the unique properties of the TiO2 produced by each process, making them complementary in the market.

While Kronos maintains a global safety policy and uses a standardized injury rate calculation, the specific requirements for recording and reporting injuries vary by location.  Some jurisdictions may require reporting of only certain types of injuries, while others may have more comprehensive reporting obligations.  This variability can lead to inconsistencies in injury data collection, making it difficult to compare safety performance across different regions.\n\nFurthermore, the differences in reporting requirements can affect the comparability of injury rates.  For example, a location with a lower reporting threshold may appear to have a better safety record simply because more injuries are reported, even if the actual injury rate is similar to another location with a higher threshold.  This can create misleading benchmarks and make it challenging to identify true trends or improvements in safety performance.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, Kronos likely employs a standardized approach to data collection and analysis, potentially using a U.S.-based injury rate calculation for global benchmarking.

However, the overall liquidity remains strong, with over three-quarters of assets being current, indicating that the company has ample short-term resources to meet its obligations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_RHI_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[45,64,40,7,43,13,37,44,48,55,46,47,53,11,29,57,62,15,74,4,54,5,6,41,42,52,61,68,16,35,95,3,65,69,1,49,94,96,73,56,34,66,10,39,63,91,93,31,92,8,28,30,36,60,100,33,67,70,90,83,17,84,9,58,85,2,72,27,32,50,86,14,59,87,88,89,38,20,77,23,12,21,25,51,98,75,78,99,76,79,81,97,80,71,82,18,24,19,22,26],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"How did the performance of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar compare to the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar throughout 2023, and what implications might these trends have for a company with significant operations in Argentina?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[87],"raw_output":"","pred":"Throughout 2023, the Argentine peso experienced significant devaluation against the U.S. dollar, with a 73% depreciation compared to 2022 and 2021. In contrast, the Mexican peso appreciated by 14% against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar appreciated by 1.3%. This trend indicates that the Argentine peso's value relative to the U.S. dollar has declined sharply, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar have strengthened.\n\nFor a company with significant operations in Argentina, these trends have several implications. First, the devaluation of the Argentine peso increases the cost of operations in Argentina, as the company may need to pay more in local currency for inputs and labor. This can lead to higher expenses and potentially lower profitability. \n\nSecond, the company may face challenges in repatriating profits, as the Argentine authorities have implemented restrictions on the repatriation of proceeds, requiring them to be denominated in Argentine pesos. This can limit the company's ability to transfer funds abroad, impacting cash flow management.\n\nAdditionally, the company might need to adjust its pricing strategies to maintain competitiveness in the Argentine market, which could affect sales volumes and overall revenue. Overall, while the Argentine peso's devaluation provides some benefits in terms of increased export competitiveness, it also introduces significant operational and financial risks that need to be carefully managed.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MUX_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[87,88,22,89,27,64,124,100,108,107,65,33,110,73,29,4,14,26,106,16,109,59,38,60,125,81,52,61,70,19,111,72,74,68,17,82,53,54,13,104,123,58,62,39,71,75,51,80,25,69,78,113,10,97,15,31,46,49,121,5,34,20,114,126,120,115,63,55,112,119,130,6,45,32,67,129,8,11,36,40,47,117,18,122,127,7,79,99,116,92,50,76,94,105,57,85,96,24,41,43,12,28,48,23,77,84,91,101,118,37,21,103,1,44,98,35,83,128,9,133,42,3,66,86,30,90,93,131,2,95,102,56,132],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

While the S&P MidCap 400 Index and peer group both experienced growth, American Eagle's return declined from $100 in 2019 to approximately $112 in 2021, then dropped sharply to around $82 in 2022 before recovering to about $112 by 2024.  The S&P MidCap 400 Index and peer group, on the other hand, showed steady growth, reaching $163 and $142 respectively by 2024.\n\nSeveral factors could explain these differences.  American Eagle faced challenges such as supply chain disruptions, inflation, and increased costs, particularly in 2022.  Additionally, the company's decision to remove Bath & Body Works and Fossil Group from its peer group in 2023 may have impacted its performance relative to the broader market.

{"question":"What factors contributed to the change in net deferred tax assets from January 28, 2023, to February 3, 2024, and how might these changes impact the company's future tax liabilities?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[74],"raw_output":"","pred":"The change in net deferred tax assets from January 28, 2023, to February 3, 2024, was primarily driven by several factors. The net deferred tax asset decreased by $1,581,000, from $36,483,000 to $82,064,000. This reduction was due to a decrease in the net deferred tax asset of Operating lease ROU assets, Operating lease liabilities, Property and equipment, and disallowed business interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee compensation and benefits and capitalized research and development expenses.\n\nThe impact of these changes on future tax liabilities is significant. The decrease in net deferred tax assets suggests that the company's ability to offset future taxable income with tax deductions and credits has diminished. This could lead to higher future tax liabilities if the company's taxable income increases without corresponding increases in deductible expenses. Additionally, the reduction in deferred tax assets might affect the company's financial statements by reducing its reported earnings and increasing its effective tax rate.\n\nFurthermore, the valuation allowances recorded on certain deferred tax assets indicate that the company expects some of these assets to be realized in the future, but not necessarily in the near term. This could imply that the company is conservatively estimating the timing and certainty of future tax benefits, which might affect its cash flow projections and financial planning. Overall, these changes highlight the company's evolving tax position and the potential for increased future tax obligations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AEO_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[39,74,75,76,38,50,57,78,64,67,54,65,66,79,77,34,48,55,69,62,58,68,37,70,85,41,6,35,40,43,46,42,81,80,53,60,51,59,72,73,52,30,36,45,29,87,71,1,5,8,28,31,63,33,113,56,110,49,4,114,20,44,86,22,21,82,24,3,14,16,27,12,102,105,15,94,109,32,103,92,98,111,93,112,10,104,13,90,99,25,83,116,117,9,101,61,91,7,18,95,96,97,17,19,23,115,119,118,89,26,100,2,47,84,88,11,107,106,108],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is because the company's reported results, financial position, and liquidity are affected by changes in key assumptions that determine net loss reserves.  Specifically, a reasonably likely increase or decrease in claim severity could impact these reserves.\n\nTo address the inherent uncertainty in establishing loss and LAE reserves, HCI Group uses a variety of methods to estimate ultimate liabilities.  These include reported loss development, paid loss development, and various actuarial techniques like the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.  The company also considers emerging trends, historical data, and other factors to refine these estimates.  However, the process is inherently uncertain due to the complexity of projecting future events and the impact of both internal and external variables on ultimate losses and LAE costs.

This event, specifically the issuance of the Municipal Agreement prohibiting hydrocarbons exploration and production activities in Puerto Guzmán Municipality, has halted all exploration activities in these blocks. The suspension has persisted for over three years, indicating that the situation has not improved or resolved.\n\nHistorically, the blocks have faced multiple challenges, including force majeure events, social and public order conditions, and the need for additional third-party reports to support termination requests. The document mentions that the company submitted requests for termination of the E&P contracts in September 2022 and January 2024, but these requests are still under review by the ANH (National Hydrocarbons Agency). The lack of progress in resolving these issues suggests that the completion of exploratory commitments is uncertain and may be delayed further.\n\nThe implications of these challenges include potential financial losses due to the prolonged suspension of activities, the need for additional investments to address the force majeure event, and the risk of losing the blocks if the termination requests are not successful.

However, the manager's authority is limited, requiring unanimous approval for major decisions by an executive committee composed of two designated individuals from the company and two from another investor. This structure introduces potential financial implications and strategic considerations:\n\n1. **Risk of Delayed Decisions**: The requirement for unanimous approval can lead to delays in decision-making, potentially impacting the venture's ability to capitalize on market opportunities or address operational challenges promptly.\n\n2. **Alignment of Interests**: The company must ensure that its interests align with those of the other investor, as both must agree on major decisions. Misalignment could lead to conflicts and delays.\n\n3. **Financial Impact**: While the company holds a significant economic interest, the limited authority could affect the venture's financial performance. For instance, the venture recognized a net loss of $3.885 million in 2023, which the company absorbed through its equity in loss of $2.914 million.\n\n4. **Strategic Flexibility**: The company's ability to influence but not control the venture limits its strategic flexibility. It must balance its desire to shape the venture's direction with the need to accommodate the other investor's perspectives.\n\n5. **Risk Management**: The company must manage the risk of the venture's financial performance, which could impact its overall financial health and strategic goals.\n\nOverall, while the company benefits from significant influence, the limitations on authority and the need for unanimous approval introduce complexities that require careful management and strategic planning.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FPH_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[12,44,65,66,34,11,15,78,9,71,38,76,36,47,56,39,62,40,103,58,57,26,42,74,86,68,27,29,51,61,3,64,75,25,107,104,106,50,108,13,23,35,32,102,16,45,49,22,46,96,31,69,72,18,48,60,63,7,20,21,91,14,28,67,24,87,30,43,89,41,70,17,33,73,105,81,59,82,83,94,8,10,85,110,79,77,90,97,112,4,5,19,109,6,55,37,95,2,113,84,99,101,111,80,52,88,92,53,98,114,100,54,1,93],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This layered interpretation allows for a more nuanced understanding of the Lease, where the original terms remain intact while the Third Amendment provides detailed amendments or additions that are necessary for the specific provisions being addressed.\n\nOverall, this method of conflict resolution ensures clarity and specificity in the amended terms while maintaining the integrity of the original Lease.","source":"data/test/NYSE_PHGE_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[236,232,233,234,235,247,238,242,237,244,225,230,240,223,221,248,239,245,251,174,219,226,229,217,250,241,228,154,199,220,267,109,63,183,210,227,231,224,249,279,205,159,132,187,197,214,216,68,200,193,212,246,62,208,171,203,243,131,185,192,201,211,222,194,207,215,32,191,198,253,60,188,265,167,204,7,170,206,209,252,61,151,155,160,164,166,195,264,127,148,158,175,181,202,5,33,58,120,169,190,196,255,146,168,260,84,157,163,165,259,64,156,184,213,261,31,59,177,263,50,133,134,136,149,51,81,180,83,108,147,152,179,35,38,65,71,78,257,37,66,80,87,145,34,67,82,106,126,254,258,72,73,77,256,262,280,4,15,18,54,55,56,92,119,282,19,129,138,150,153,178,30,52,20,23,39,74,128,41,135,13,53,124,16,22,27,88,116,266,69,70,85,86,121,130,143,182,40,43,114,173,269,46,57,278,6,8,29,91,47,123,21,42,137,1,25,48,105,144,24,189,218,14,176,36,104,122,172,17,28,281,9,45,97,125,90,99,100,117,49,12,93,276,79,75,98,26,103,186,76,89,101,277,268,140,271,3,10,44,102,112,141,272,107,161,270,139,11,162,94,96,115,142,275,110,274,113,118,273,95,111,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Additionally, $4 million was allocated to other comprehensive income. This increase was partially offset by a $39 million decrease in the valuation allowance due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on a tax credit carryover.\n\nComparatively, from 2021 to 2022, the valuation allowance decreased by $67 million, with $93 million allocated to income from continuing operations and $4 million to other comprehensive income.

{"question":"Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow did Home Depot's comparable sales performance in fiscal 2023 compare to its overall net sales performance, and what factors contributed to the difference between these two metrics?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[36],"raw_output":"","pred":"Home Depot's comparable sales performance in fiscal 2023 (-3.2%) was worse than its overall net sales performance (-3.0%). This difference can be attributed to a few key factors:\n\n1. Net sales decreased by $4.7 billion, or 3.0%, while comparable sales decreased by $4.9 billion, or 3.2%.\n\n2. The comparable sales metric excludes new stores and remodels, focusing only on existing locations. This means it provides a more accurate picture of sales performance at existing stores.\n\n3. The comparable sales decline was driven by a 2.9% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 0.3% decrease in comparable average ticket.\n\n4. The overall net sales decrease was likely influenced by factors like new store openings and remodels, which were not part of the comparable sales calculation.\n\n5. The negative comparable sales were impacted by macroeconomic factors like a shift in consumer spending away from goods to services, higher interest rates pressuring home improvement demand, and lumber price deflation.\n\n6. While online sales increased slightly, this was not enough to offset the decline in comparable sales.\n\n7. The company noted that lumber price deflation negatively impacted comparable sales, which likely contributed to the larger overall net sales decrease.\n\nIn summary, while comparable sales provide a more focused view of existing store performance, the broader net sales metric captures the impact of new store activity and other factors that affected overall sales performance in fiscal 2023.","source":"data/test/NYSE_HD_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[36,2,35,6,8,37,34,39,12,40,47,43,3,27,16,46,13,56,10,50,9,17,33,28,38,18,41,42,52,77,11,49,67,72,74,7,15,48,73,20,57,59,69,83,99,64,68,25,55,21,66,88,4,63,26,45,65,22,53,58,14,54,61,51,23,32,71,75,1,5,19,80,90,30,60,79,89,98,44,76,85,70,84,91,24,29,78,81,93,31,62,92,87,94,82,96,97,95,86],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

In fiscal year 2023, the gross profit margin decreased to 48.7%, compared to 65.9% in fiscal year 2022. This decline was attributed to an increase in cloud costs for a significant revenue customer that ramped up in the second half of fiscal year 2023. Additionally, there were duplicative charges that occurred while certain customers transitioned from their on-premises to cloud-hosted deployment formats. The establishment of an inventory reserve during fiscal year 2023 also contributed to the decrease in gross margin.\n\nThese factors negatively impacted the overall financial performance by reducing the profitability of the company's operations. The increased cloud costs and transition-related charges directly reduced the gross profit, leading to a lower margin. Furthermore, the establishment of an inventory reserve further eroded the profitability, as it represents a non-cash expense that reduces the net income.\n\nOverall, these changes in gross profit margin reflect a shift towards higher cloud-based operations, which are generally less profitable than traditional on-premises solutions. This shift, combined with the additional costs associated with transitioning customers and managing inventory, resulted in a significant decline in the company's profitability and financial performance.","source":"data/test/NYSE_IRNT_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[43,42,41,52,45,33,40,18,20,38,3,55,69,61,21,24,32,57,39,59,68,28,22,15,65,70,56,73,8,50,34,62,25,29,46,5,26,30,47,74,31,64,49,72,27,66,13,23,76,53,10,36,51,44,63,16,19,58,91,35,71,92,93,48,67,94,4,60,17,54,37,78,75,81,6,77,84,86,87,1,7,14,89,2,83,80,85,88,79,82,9,12,11,90],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This indicates that the cost associated with providing benefits to employees who are currently working has remained consistent.\n\n2. **Interest Cost**: The interest cost increased from $0.3 million in 2022 to $0.5 million in 2023. This rise suggests that the cost of borrowing money to fund the benefits has increased, likely due to higher interest rates or changes in the discount rate used to calculate the obligation.\n\n3. **Benefits Paid**: The benefits paid decreased from $0.2 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023. This reduction could be due to changes in the benefits provided or the number of employees receiving benefits.\n\n4. **Actuarial Gain**: The actuarial gain decreased from $2.0 million in 2022 to $0.7 million in 2023. This decline indicates that the positive impact from changes in the actuarial assumptions or the financial market conditions that led to gains in 2022 were not as favorable in 2023.\n\n5. **Currency Fluctuation Adjustment**: The currency fluctuation adjustment decreased from $0.8 million in 2022 to $0.1 million in 2023. This reduction suggests that the impact of currency changes on the benefit obligation was less significant in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nOverall, the increase in interest cost and service cost, coupled with the decrease in benefits paid and actuarial gain, led to a slight decrease in the benefit obligation from $11.3 million in 2022 to $8.9 million in 2023.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMP_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,118,84,85,113,115,7,71,79,83,130,97,68,73,72,116,19,74,102,120,49,88,90,94,125,138,17,78,34,46,69,80,121,62,47,129,45,50,81,100,48,87,105,112,9,101,106,126,131,135,114,95,104,117,136,142,43,44,61,96,134,12,57,110,70,75,20,21,67,140,122,107,123,127,137,56,77,103,37,145,55,111,33,92,108,109,128,155,6,160,76,133,24,63,82,162,25,99,23,35,86,132,4,66,18,93,32,91,1,98,153,41,22,64,151,14,124,141,30,31,26,144,36,157,54,143,15,166,16,60,163,38,139,149,42,27,152,10,28,150,29,65,89,3,5,53,51,13,11,158,159,8,59,39,154,165,146,147,164,161,2,40,52,156,148,58],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

These objects can catch fire or explode, leading to severe damage to the vehicle's interior and potentially causing injury or death to the occupants. The flammable nature of these substances makes them highly susceptible to ignition, especially in the confined space of a vehicle where heat and friction can easily occur. Additionally, the presence of these items can obstruct the driver's view, making it difficult to navigate safely and increasing the risk of accidents. \n\nFurthermore, the front passenger's front airbag may not function properly if these objects are placed near it, as the airbag deployment can displace or damage them. This can result in inadequate protection for the passenger in case of an accident. The risk of fire is exacerbated when these objects are left unattended, as they can ignite due to external factors such as static electricity or heat from the vehicle's interior. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid bringing these potentially hazardous items into the vehicle to ensure the safety of all occupants and prevent potential accidents or fires.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[112,242,48,50,399,388,239,46,389,532,70,104,132,429,62,384,59,241,6,459,466,113,379,537,98,111,530,97,142,528,103,382,518,525,534,383,385,314,395,517,47,206,453,51,208,226,302,365,373,397,400,60,125,482,510,52,107,213,240,372,527,71,205,209,396,398,110,117,187,425,426,522,57,58,74,122,350,427,531,63,66,102,266,275,315,390,100,116,124,222,263,303,366,376,465,467,512,55,56,363,423,495,529,551,61,126,207,370,377,418,424,483,2,3,64,69,127,253,255,257,358,422,496,49,90,94,101,144,374,380,387,401,513,14,45,88,149,238,244,336,355,362,494,514,569,75,154,265,353,485,489,252,258,357,392,457,521,4,72,87,135,225,229,267,356,381,391,463,515,523,141,264,288,299,472,93,186,246,340,516,44,78,89,105,121,227,106,145,330,333,361,464,486,488,499,53,67,73,115,129,293,348,349,364,404,487,520,533,31,109,204,393,417,434,449,492,524,137,221,250,294,419,444,497,519,553,92,99,150,162,212,268,304,430,511,95,254,285,291,368,555,568,54,159,193,214,245,310,327,335,339,342,346,352,410,439,68,139,191,219,220,277,296,329,493,22,79,83,188,192,243,256,371,378,460,552,554,210,216,506,1,24,82,84,120,217,269,375,490,108,321,403,428,446,25,119,130,284,311,503,65,91,128,270,421,461,491,133,134,152,211,251,324,451,454,468,80,85,96,123,138,202,276,286,462,42,77,114,118,249,279,297,344,452,541,557,38,76,189,218,228,231,237,278,456,7,10,17,39,131,185,190,196,203,273,334,367,436,478,546,567,23,35,172,261,287,292,347,432,433,540,558,11,300,301,322,323,359,409,437,447,479,544,545,550,570,157,175,184,338,415,438,448,504,143,155,164,223,233,282,308,313,319,337,507,21,36,168,174,180,215,247,260,343,442,443,455,508,13,33,224,274,280,316,317,325,369,542,556,16,171,262,271,290,305,306,320,341,470,535,8,32,148,234,281,543,30,41,86,140,167,232,272,328,458,475,481,484,502,9,81,156,173,201,230,248,298,309,326,345,469,473,34,37,195,236,259,283,331,354,406,445,5,19,26,146,153,163,170,307,312,318,351,386,435,440,12,43,182,199,295,332,360,471,477,505,165,178,183,235,412,450,536,538,151,526,40,402,539,136,198,394,549,169,181,289,416,480,564,15,29,197,498,405,166,28,179,476,420,563,18,548,176,408,160,20,27,194,501,147,413,562,177,411,431,500,200,547,509,158,441,560,559,414,474,566,161,407,565,561],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This can be done by pressing the \"SET\" button on the steering wheel or by using the speed control buttons on the instrument cluster.\n3. **Restart the System**: After setting the speed, restart the adaptive cruise control system to ensure it operates correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can resolve the issue and resume using the adaptive cruise control safely and effectively.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[36,313,325,326,174,180,291,284,177,175,303,315,321,34,152,33,40,172,271,304,310,35,264,37,292,38,173,229,220,30,39,32,164,185,344,200,363,550,31,357,171,308,312,323,138,302,319,128,168,258,324,328,354,499,218,176,193,212,250,253,260,314,353,374,131,216,255,276,190,215,165,181,188,166,169,305,68,132,178,182,187,217,239,346,356,154,184,201,219,252,316,25,210,285,306,318,524,17,71,186,227,340,364,525,257,331,332,27,272,307,345,389,426,230,237,246,322,385,496,126,167,183,248,311,373,382,22,94,256,390,429,459,460,196,197,214,225,235,238,240,283,293,372,395,123,192,221,358,361,384,391,523,96,125,151,211,277,355,381,554,67,130,191,206,342,343,348,365,419,134,139,142,150,159,287,333,359,375,388,466,502,111,116,129,163,226,244,263,170,179,208,254,317,335,380,457,21,41,89,90,122,205,300,520,521,551,50,58,330,366,492,124,249,290,349,425,515,115,148,157,162,198,202,213,352,488,491,522,54,56,97,140,222,338,368,400,489,498,57,69,103,110,141,189,209,360,362,376,378,379,398,518,4,49,104,121,127,261,262,296,329,347,371,453,519,117,273,367,383,137,298,387,497,500,512,537,546,48,112,145,195,203,236,267,278,320,418,467,486,530,75,224,231,241,274,299,392,427,470,503,46,88,133,155,275,327,336,339,423,532,120,144,243,247,415,482,516,553,555,45,61,65,92,95,135,270,282,337,447,458,495,3,53,207,242,393,399,401,416,439,485,513,62,70,91,101,161,199,309,377,396,13,23,51,102,113,146,149,223,228,233,279,448,452,483,494,514,528,544,52,55,66,268,269,394,397,409,430,454,462,468,529,59,98,143,286,289,295,417,424,461,463,548,552,12,26,64,72,74,87,114,234,288,434,444,449,451,493,501,517,42,105,156,194,204,294,408,410,412,442,443,464,472,490,510,527,531,534,18,63,245,334,350,370,465,545,93,153,158,232,428,511,543,265,266,404,422,281,438,469,14,44,60,280,420,435,437,369,406,24,99,440,16,29,47,79,259,413,446,558,568,251,351,411,436,450,479,484,160,100,136,341,432,487,569,11,119,403,445,456,533,7,73,297,433,147,549,118,414,474,301,473,505,405,476,481,2,556,9,386,43,78,106,504,84,108,471,526,541,567,6,407,509,28,77,83,107,507,536,5,109,455,475,10,542,478,477,564,540,508,557,1,535,76,8,20,82,570,402,562,506,566,15,563,565,421,559,19,85,480,81,561,80,86,560,431,441,539,538,547],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}
{"question":"What precautions should be taken when using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, and why are these precautions necessary?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[530],"raw_output":"","pred":"When using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, several precautions should be taken to prevent damage to the vehicle's body and parts. Firstly, it is crucial to keep the nozzle of the high-pressure cleaner away from the vehicle sufficiently. Bringing the nozzle too close or pointing it towards the opening of the front grill, bumper, or other parts can cause damage and malfunction. This is because high-pressure water can penetrate the openings and cause internal damage, leading to leaks or other mechanical issues. Additionally, pointing the nozzle towards door glasses and door frames can allow water to enter the cabin, potentially causing electrical short circuits or other internal damage.\n\nThese precautions are necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of the vehicle. Directing high-pressure water towards sensitive areas can lead to water intrusion, which can damage electrical components, cause rust, or even lead to structural issues. By maintaining a safe distance and avoiding direct contact with critical areas, the risk of damage is significantly reduced, ensuring the vehicle remains in optimal condition.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[530,336,529,340,532,144,350,388,246,483,132,265,527,142,330,429,533,267,303,465,528,111,365,381,418,531,239,122,126,459,534,376,425,208,314,390,371,206,379,382,384,387,521,204,537,48,121,225,252,353,378,91,253,380,479,494,103,258,263,403,424,453,212,254,255,302,423,452,466,515,226,275,374,377,426,518,525,389,63,221,256,266,349,357,373,520,58,116,385,404,457,472,496,523,102,110,115,510,71,250,486,93,113,296,482,513,514,524,52,101,104,229,14,145,150,240,392,416,488,72,90,125,241,245,273,274,454,470,497,519,57,59,66,112,209,238,391,401,464,44,187,372,396,55,56,159,174,213,361,398,493,45,61,62,70,244,268,354,397,428,522,558,46,47,50,51,60,75,88,98,117,207,217,285,375,417,568,65,69,87,205,222,291,299,554,97,149,196,243,276,352,355,410,458,489,105,129,242,315,348,366,400,427,541,3,22,74,124,133,134,137,192,358,491,49,257,284,288,356,409,422,492,495,511,551,569,33,54,227,269,362,446,455,512,37,139,321,436,463,485,516,94,143,310,319,324,399,434,499,53,277,308,395,118,154,163,188,293,393,432,451,109,114,437,438,462,2,305,333,447,448,461,481,89,218,228,550,108,190,191,316,327,339,342,369,433,526,556,106,152,304,4,83,162,247,261,344,419,430,517,553,67,107,210,219,249,364,175,211,260,367,484,120,135,230,335,368,442,443,444,23,25,92,202,487,11,38,78,439,220,223,449,540,542,84,127,153,64,141,146,320,322,323,347,363,456,338,77,177,232,272,544,557,1,10,95,248,292,351,415,471,473,477,555,79,99,193,287,406,552,68,236,264,311,7,96,279,507,73,307,412,476,155,170,214,270,309,318,138,370,5,200,233,294,467,36,136,140,158,186,383,411,478,6,30,216,278,508,271,329,504,100,237,440,128,130,160,259,282,312,405,408,27,31,345,505,313,326,468,475,545,17,35,148,185,337,343,469,325,346,546,32,119,172,203,251,262,297,317,543,298,21,157,231,328,359,460,147,180,498,502,224,235,281,474,24,161,194,234,300,306,450,490,215,445,151,164,166,535,13,41,81,131,8,123,331,171,280,301,76,86,286,181,435,334,414,9,82,156,184,283,332,413,16,183,189,386,407,561,12,42,506,29,567,80,169,195,431,18,34,201,295,536,549,182,197,26,40,85,167,178,290,570,15,28,503,20,564,566,198,199,39,165,341,173,480,421,509,548,289,360,538,500,19,176,402,168,420,563,394,441,501,565,43,560,559,179,562,547,539],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Impact from the side to the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment\n2. Impact from the side at an oblique angle\n\nThese scenarios are particularly dangerous for occupants for the following reasons:\n\n1. Impact from the side to the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment: This scenario likely means that the side impact occurs on the side of the vehicle that does not have side airbags or side curtain airbags. Since these airbags are only designed to inflate on the impacted side, they will not provide protection in this situation. This could result in severe injuries to occupants on the opposite side of the vehicle.\n\n2. Impact from the side at an oblique angle: An oblique impact means the force is not directly perpendicular to the vehicle's side. This type of collision is less likely to trigger the side airbag sensors, which are typically designed to detect more direct side impacts. As a result, occupants on the impacted side may not receive the intended protection.\n\nThese scenarios are dangerous because they expose occupants to the full force of the impact without the cushioning effect of the airbags. This can lead to severe injuries such as fractures, internal organ damage, or head trauma, especially if occupants are not properly restrained by seat belts. The lack of airbag protection in these situations underscores the importance of always wearing seat belts and avoiding dangerous driving conditions.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[109,110,103,95,94,104,108,107,112,100,99,106,555,97,105,14,98,101,44,46,48,59,357,372,62,74,111,393,552,383,429,71,87,47,60,132,189,288,294,384,205,389,398,41,82,263,339,439,61,102,269,297,6,49,242,347,23,52,66,93,315,373,404,7,50,79,280,361,382,532,88,96,348,416,463,42,376,388,92,227,277,303,342,409,241,363,400,522,528,282,310,333,335,444,51,68,296,425,434,470,524,537,550,90,273,356,358,366,472,55,69,77,281,304,408,414,417,423,38,57,406,407,449,553,33,78,89,113,187,275,286,300,311,329,351,379,403,426,521,554,43,67,70,117,264,265,267,338,396,412,424,433,496,45,73,75,240,279,359,378,432,465,510,9,31,36,130,321,385,551,22,35,39,63,64,116,122,125,137,194,230,344,362,374,413,489,520,12,72,76,186,188,193,213,237,276,278,293,330,340,438,453,523,533,16,83,219,233,236,270,314,322,392,395,466,556,124,142,154,204,208,216,229,268,271,390,419,442,443,525,32,58,65,244,284,291,353,401,405,437,527,37,84,129,299,327,332,346,15,34,127,133,162,201,226,239,248,266,345,365,377,380,479,569,13,27,120,121,143,179,192,198,206,207,231,285,334,336,349,422,503,530,91,134,169,184,209,224,225,253,257,328,343,464,467,469,529,568,2,24,114,115,135,136,138,152,168,182,190,197,256,302,375,391,447,471,516,40,56,123,150,203,217,220,228,252,287,301,399,411,459,484,485,487,18,29,131,175,178,180,200,214,246,292,312,448,490,515,518,30,54,128,176,211,255,258,324,428,468,498,26,166,171,195,249,262,341,355,364,381,415,458,546,570,4,21,126,174,181,202,212,274,290,323,337,440,454,475,488,513,545,164,170,191,196,325,418,435,460,461,493,494,495,28,141,144,185,238,289,306,326,371,450,476,483,519,25,146,147,172,234,235,250,316,331,350,352,387,421,486,492,497,512,517,558,81,153,163,173,218,222,254,283,313,319,320,491,501,86,167,210,221,223,232,309,317,410,436,462,478,482,531,53,139,199,295,308,430,445,474,481,536,8,80,159,165,386,427,446,567,10,17,85,118,183,251,397,540,559,560,145,148,151,215,259,305,360,367,420,457,534,544,565,3,272,354,451,514,140,261,368,369,119,177,394,499,557,563,500,160,307,542,511,564,298,539,260,370,477,538,245,505,549,5,247,526,456,502,543,243,318,402,158,452,548,11,455,535,149,155,1,541,473,506,156,480,19,157,161,508,561,504,562,507,20,566,509,547,441,431],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Increasing the Highlights setting (moving the slider to the right) will make the bright areas of the image appear brighter and more defined, potentially increasing the contrast in those areas.  Conversely, decreasing the Highlights setting will make the bright areas darker and less defined, reducing contrast.\n\nIncreasing the Shadows setting (moving the slider to the right) will make the dark areas of the image appear darker and more pronounced, potentially increasing the contrast in those areas.  Decreasing the Shadows setting will make the dark areas lighter and less defined, reducing contrast.\n\nThe combined effect of these adjustments on the overall dynamic range depends on the starting point of the image.  If the image has a wide dynamic range to begin with, increasing both Highlights and Shadows can enhance the contrast throughout the image.  If the image has limited dynamic range, increasing either Highlights or Shadows alone may be more effective, depending on which area needs more definition.\n\nThe goal is to achieve a balanced contrast that preserves detail in both the highlights and shadows without introducing unnatural artifacts.  The Tone Curve provides a flexible tool for fine-tuning this balance.\n","source":"data/test/xt50.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[264,167,168,6,4,236,16,19,169,52,159,235,139,166,158,262,265,178,148,336,361,365,331,208,352,366,173,20,164,332,372,328,374,7,160,165,254,150,161,162,170,231,251,98,114,232,48,182,193,13,242,177,389,51,141,252,325,329,368,10,56,140,157,5,89,152,342,8,22,23,61,125,132,253,257,392,124,326,118,138,163,17,43,54,393,209,222,18,45,127,154,184,212,229,330,359,418,101,228,259,348,33,103,370,57,188,198,220,226,134,192,15,99,181,237,240,324,55,104,128,145,327,344,390,46,109,394,91,110,137,210,244,319,430,37,96,151,142,203,221,238,258,427,75,122,217,218,272,425,431,80,84,133,197,351,369,423,9,93,200,275,318,371,388,50,250,59,180,196,243,34,36,108,172,179,282,406,213,224,249,312,315,349,426,119,194,211,230,337,341,395,126,261,320,362,24,97,120,214,234,309,333,355,102,189,353,385,14,39,123,183,199,241,335,339,340,386,440,129,247,248,396,405,442,187,191,274,38,42,215,245,136,155,171,216,263,391,438,63,100,105,205,206,227,190,204,357,363,106,175,223,399,41,58,77,112,387,87,92,115,146,233,436,32,53,149,225,239,334,338,346,422,429,439,186,283,311,381,407,11,35,49,64,202,354,419,12,29,268,345,88,201,255,281,288,313,321,72,113,130,174,347,397,256,260,269,297,302,400,403,445,447,40,44,76,78,310,411,413,424,60,95,107,153,156,287,303,408,409,437,79,135,144,147,377,47,121,176,219,246,277,322,382,384,441,86,289,343,83,94,185,307,364,383,421,434,435,21,62,116,143,195,299,402,415,28,30,66,73,74,398,420,26,85,316,267,273,284,358,373,404,25,90,305,308,356,376,410,414,68,266,278,290,317,446,31,71,111,117,271,279,292,314,444,2,295,296,428,443,207,270,323,285,70,350,380,306,375,433,69,293,81,417,3,294,448,82,286,301,304,378,401,291,367,276,1,131,298,416,379,432,280,412,300,360,27,67,65],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This ensures that the camera maintains proper exposure control even without a physical aperture ring on the lens.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that the roles played by the front command dial can be changed using the \"COMMAND DIAL SETTING\" function, allowing for further customization of how the command dial is used for aperture adjustments.","source":"data/test/xt50.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[101,108,110,36,23,382,10,38,103,381,346,109,39,347,37,114,150,259,58,125,340,422,98,104,33,102,145,184,192,99,100,129,386,89,165,338,341,363,128,235,30,55,193,4,107,123,157,204,138,60,143,178,369,388,121,343,366,372,394,5,6,232,13,15,117,213,344,17,120,137,189,358,374,32,35,115,119,273,367,393,111,197,385,387,390,116,375,384,34,147,194,318,373,45,82,151,188,268,315,41,52,131,191,368,7,112,430,57,91,210,212,330,31,51,214,322,345,423,56,59,105,339,392,421,25,96,97,141,152,170,244,307,350,391,40,43,124,276,348,198,325,370,127,166,179,182,187,260,272,331,365,383,427,9,76,164,240,362,364,378,440,18,139,149,177,208,239,261,324,333,77,238,242,275,320,371,442,71,84,130,195,342,361,389,406,411,431,22,66,81,126,257,285,335,132,146,183,217,227,252,295,319,328,435,16,61,133,231,241,254,311,352,19,53,144,196,216,230,247,262,284,297,397,403,424,432,12,24,70,75,93,163,199,211,245,399,416,428,73,190,206,226,404,417,443,113,134,253,304,327,349,405,418,419,425,65,92,158,281,292,439,44,106,118,135,181,209,271,290,312,316,351,438,42,202,233,236,249,264,294,298,309,380,407,64,155,162,173,246,258,313,83,88,90,201,237,286,287,293,299,305,306,308,359,426,20,46,54,136,200,215,251,336,379,21,69,80,243,301,326,329,353,408,434,49,122,140,148,160,167,221,223,265,429,14,27,72,185,203,402,409,48,205,250,291,300,396,47,142,169,172,207,218,400,171,303,332,415,11,154,180,277,282,302,413,68,159,186,334,398,414,50,67,168,337,28,85,248,323,1,228,229,274,310,410,8,220,280,401,161,219,234,321,433,270,288,289,2,74,296,436,278,441,153,225,256,263,266,354,412,175,222,224,283,314,377,437,444,176,355,420,3,174,356,267,95,62,86,360,87,269,279,376,447,78,448,94,445,446,26,79,255,317,357,395,156,63,29],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The NEC calculates the load based on the total connected load listed on the model/serial/rating plate, which is less than the actual power consumption of the range. For this specific range, the NEC calculated load is less than the total connected load of 15 kW at 120/240 V and 10 kW at 120/208 V.\n\nThe table indicates that for ranges with a power rating of 16.6-22.5 kW at 120/240 V or 12.6-18.5 kW at 120/208 V, the specified rating of the power supply cord kit and circuit protection is 50 amperes. Since the range's actual power rating is 15 kW at 120/240 V and 10 kW at 120/208 V, which falls within the lower range of the specified power ratings, the minimum requirement is 40 amperes. However, to ensure adequate protection and safety, the higher rating of 50 amperes is recommended.

{"question":"What potential issue with the PFCW system is illustrated by the vehicle being towed in the middle of the image?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[395],"raw_output":"","pred":"The image illustrates a potential issue with the PFCW system when a vehicle ahead is being towed. This scenario shows a towed vehicle in the middle lane, with another vehicle following closely behind. The PFCW system is designed to detect vehicles ahead, but when a towed vehicle is present, it may not be recognized as a normal vehicle.\n\nThe key issue here is that the PFCW system relies on radar sensors to detect vehicles. When a towed vehicle is present, the radar sensor may not be able to accurately measure the distance to the towed vehicle, as it might interpret it as an obstacle or an irregular object rather than a regular vehicle. This could lead to false alerts or missed warnings, potentially causing the driver to misinterpret the situation and take incorrect actions.\n\nAdditionally, the towed vehicle's position in the lane could obstruct the radar sensor's view, further complicating the system's ability to accurately measure distances and detect potential collisions. This highlights the importance of being aware of the system's limitations and potential blind spots in such scenarios, especially when driving behind towed vehicles.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[396,393,391,394,398,397,287,291,285,526,316,253,355,385,288,540,114,282,286,290,127,113,542,110,106,132,246,126,244,25,342,387,136,382,392,450,263,386,449,514,518,26,98,384,142,182,383,62,388,472,124,158,276,338,399,8,223,231,199,440,121,159,369,373,389,390,1,164,204,219,324,343,371,395,409,521,131,232,541,221,537,9,33,162,520,170,209,255,279,289,325,410,512,22,166,433,438,519,140,328,85,160,307,522,122,148,165,233,309,322,339,448,516,222,273,406,517,524,529,536,19,134,147,152,154,270,301,313,347,486,497,501,43,53,108,172,183,220,238,427,3,107,217,264,402,463,125,258,312,318,330,340,437,447,465,527,84,138,256,262,461,525,535,7,10,135,169,180,195,205,260,296,317,348,370,457,462,499,64,66,102,141,203,269,272,280,310,327,479,491,156,171,274,349,418,477,511,20,133,226,297,441,55,61,93,104,225,306,331,345,361,368,416,422,439,481,14,23,86,144,240,251,319,320,363,467,484,493,101,145,200,265,271,494,531,50,52,116,130,163,197,234,329,337,445,468,47,99,128,146,208,227,261,275,356,379,480,523,5,32,40,46,57,224,229,257,278,300,323,341,357,364,411,417,434,458,488,42,83,109,151,161,216,218,237,266,267,354,421,430,435,446,56,67,115,167,239,247,292,344,378,478,533,15,178,198,210,252,293,360,372,380,76,173,194,215,228,230,235,245,321,336,362,420,436,515,48,65,87,92,155,201,248,268,470,473,474,502,505,100,143,196,259,277,298,315,403,431,485,513,18,34,38,39,41,75,97,150,157,184,206,243,333,469,27,69,119,207,304,311,332,358,70,79,112,177,202,334,377,404,408,412,498,528,44,78,236,544,37,58,60,63,88,129,353,374,381,423,426,456,2,51,68,82,111,187,414,508,21,80,168,179,294,425,453,466,496,500,504,506,510,24,45,49,94,103,283,299,308,181,451,482,6,123,139,242,303,314,507,77,95,153,176,191,295,400,407,475,12,35,188,212,335,424,489,503,509,11,31,74,105,211,281,366,492,17,54,149,175,213,359,454,476,28,36,71,305,326,464,471,539,81,254,375,429,490,29,185,186,189,543,214,405,415,442,30,59,91,190,376,13,241,302,419,530,89,137,193,284,413,487,118,352,365,444,538,4,428,90,350,483,401,455,120,72,367,249,346,192,432,459,532,351,96,443,452,534,117,16,73,250,174,460,495],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The rear parking sensor is a crucial component of the Rear Automatic Emergency Braking (Rear AEB) system. Its primary function is to detect obstacles behind the vehicle when the vehicle is in reverse. \n\nWhen the shift lever is in the R (Reverse) position and the vehicle speed is less than approximately 9 MPH (15 km/h), the Rear AEB system activates. The rear parking sensor uses ultrasonic waves to scan the area directly behind the vehicle. If the sensor detects an obstacle, it sends a signal to the system, which then warns the driver by flashing the Rear AEB system warning indicator in the multi-information display and chiming three times. \n\nAdditionally, the system automatically applies the brakes to help avoid a collision. After the automatic brake application, the driver must depress the brake pedal to maintain brake pressure. The stop lights of the vehicle also come on during this process. The rear parking sensor thus plays a vital role in enhancing safety by providing early warning and automatic braking assistance when backing up, thereby reducing the risk of rear-end collisions.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[403,404,402,292,406,109,285,405,8,540,15,253,290,526,102,110,114,283,113,319,320,307,309,247,348,303,223,243,6,121,152,302,321,143,218,245,291,38,132,153,324,392,274,325,503,86,94,180,344,428,474,82,216,228,296,13,118,127,230,239,310,328,343,355,383,421,423,441,66,157,238,329,331,401,463,482,542,30,96,297,373,7,10,69,148,217,384,394,427,11,312,318,399,436,93,111,194,19,155,162,351,479,9,14,47,58,84,106,112,142,206,277,357,468,12,147,154,418,510,535,29,100,134,145,207,229,295,354,382,95,470,481,500,146,236,359,512,27,105,183,220,255,323,334,379,398,475,478,136,166,233,350,358,389,97,128,140,179,208,259,280,332,20,50,103,67,79,137,210,237,445,78,104,176,235,279,306,397,21,25,99,209,241,390,426,37,49,62,150,205,278,286,308,375,43,224,370,380,491,51,264,330,141,221,287,322,339,342,391,366,76,122,123,133,144,163,184,197,199,311,396,36,87,124,164,381,388,467,486,23,34,40,75,169,219,284,425,439,22,41,61,171,298,409,473,55,126,131,160,232,347,465,225,313,346,362,477,537,541,17,46,139,269,335,442,447,457,484,511,18,56,85,193,275,349,364,413,498,523,52,57,81,83,92,165,200,201,372,376,410,430,509,519,70,88,190,215,258,314,317,337,48,77,135,341,60,156,159,211,248,387,98,107,212,240,368,393,26,65,125,172,231,356,440,24,39,91,158,187,504,516,203,265,434,455,129,182,195,301,336,361,524,63,161,177,227,300,385,407,483,28,64,73,252,289,369,493,538,45,71,151,480,33,80,178,222,271,429,459,35,202,345,363,438,44,53,54,130,244,246,371,374,536,5,167,170,191,352,360,450,446,488,31,213,333,340,499,501,505,544,59,115,138,234,251,270,288,327,471,525,74,226,272,198,204,254,276,400,414,451,466,530,68,116,168,415,419,420,462,533,256,326,437,119,175,316,338,422,173,267,315,365,367,411,461,507,539,249,378,449,520,42,72,192,262,293,408,117,454,464,472,490,185,395,458,515,2,412,424,444,476,101,453,529,4,32,149,469,497,518,527,266,417,485,487,502,181,299,386,435,531,496,532,242,263,294,189,416,489,3,90,214,273,120,260,431,456,522,281,495,508,268,433,514,543,108,188,282,432,494,305,377,448,492,528,186,196,261,517,257,443,513,521,89,353,506,304,250,16,452,1,174,460,534],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The target text explicitly states that \"Explosive hydrogen gas is always present in the vicinity of the battery.\" \n\nThis step is important for several reasons:\n\n1. It helps reduce the risk of an explosion by providing a barrier between the battery and any sparks or flames that could ignite the hydrogen gas.\n\n2. It creates a humid environment around the battery, which can help prevent static electricity buildup that could trigger an explosion.\n\n3. The moist cloth acts as a shield, protecting the battery from direct contact with the jumper cables and other electrical components.\n\n4. It provides a visual cue that the battery is being properly prepared for jump starting.\n\n5. By covering the battery, it ensures that the jump starting process is carried out in a controlled manner, minimizing the risk of accidental sparks or fires.\n\nThis precaution is crucial because hydrogen gas is highly flammable and can explode violently if ignited.

{"question":"What are the limitations and appropriate usage conditions of the ACC system, and why is it crucial for the driver to remain attentive and in control even when the system is active?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[327],"raw_output":"","pred":"The ACC system, while an aid, has several limitations and specific usage conditions. It is not a collision warning or avoidance device and is intended for highway use only, not city driving. The system's effectiveness is limited by driving, traffic, weather, and road conditions. It cannot react to stationary or slow-moving vehicles and does not apply more than 40% of the vehicle's total braking power. The ACC system is designed to maintain a selected distance from the vehicle ahead, decelerating as necessary, but it cannot prevent accidents or control speed in emergency situations.\n\nIt's crucial for the driver to remain attentive and in control because the ACC system is supplementary, not a substitute for the driver's responsibilities. The driver must still observe speed limits, be aware of their surroundings, and be prepared to take manual control if the system's limitations are exceeded. The system's warnings and chimes are designed to alert the driver to potential issues, but the driver must still respond appropriately.

The ID card area is 5.4 inches * 4.1 inches = 22.14 square inches.\n\nThe unused area is the difference between the total scannable area and the ID card area: 34.44 square inches - 22.14 square inches = 12.3 square inches.\n\nTo find the percentage of unused area, we divide the unused area by the total scannable area and multiply by 100:\n\n(12.3 square inches / 34.44 square inches) * 100 = 35.8%\n\nTherefore, approximately 35.8% of the scannable area is left unused when placing the ID card according to the instructions.\n","source":"data/test/mfcj1800dw.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[129,147,144,364,401,58,60,61,126,143,57,123,337,124,130,345,3,148,113,128,146,46,158,363,429,404,151,152,385,96,97,98,325,400,393,402,466,2,121,136,344,377,479,481,100,289,411,28,95,112,349,478,419,99,110,291,347,374,382,102,240,343,356,111,132,155,464,88,115,127,242,468,118,154,157,462,105,258,17,153,162,360,381,386,56,101,120,134,15,108,125,216,310,91,107,198,276,376,427,480,38,69,249,324,327,392,430,86,114,348,391,34,117,215,220,305,346,365,33,106,137,145,243,269,375,390,465,65,72,359,414,450,41,87,94,135,368,388,418,44,64,218,219,264,413,426,36,54,90,104,321,394,456,457,8,25,37,192,248,253,296,297,323,353,412,18,30,444,5,82,195,278,292,311,370,371,410,453,484,4,32,89,202,234,246,295,307,367,74,76,109,119,139,185,275,293,301,329,333,358,362,380,416,423,467,476,40,43,52,180,227,285,303,317,335,428,6,22,92,122,138,140,174,188,193,213,229,336,352,378,454,458,485,24,103,186,223,266,342,396,398,420,440,472,16,171,265,277,315,366,373,45,81,189,204,233,261,272,354,379,70,205,338,351,406,482,27,35,67,75,221,239,244,383,384,425,460,42,78,85,163,178,208,225,236,287,299,475,20,39,68,73,133,168,182,226,237,268,290,330,403,438,451,473,47,48,131,141,200,228,304,339,355,409,50,156,161,176,209,230,255,288,441,443,446,463,470,49,166,169,201,203,260,273,350,369,372,407,424,62,93,165,177,247,318,331,442,175,187,207,238,274,312,397,415,170,224,232,259,280,286,328,332,431,14,66,80,83,179,211,217,357,399,437,459,19,167,172,245,251,361,395,408,435,447,160,173,196,322,341,387,26,53,184,197,206,210,270,439,448,474,51,159,194,281,284,298,302,314,13,214,241,267,271,294,300,23,316,445,461,9,21,79,436,449,181,191,212,257,263,313,7,31,422,487,10,183,231,250,319,433,55,84,235,340,389,59,63,116,222,309,320,150,199,421,71,283,306,455,149,417,486,29,164,262,326,142,190,432,77,477,434,483,256,452,11,279,334,471,1,12,308,282,254,469,405,252],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What are the potential drawbacks of using custom phone features on the same line as a fax machine, and how can Brother's ECM feature mitigate these issues?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[380],"raw_output":"","pred":"Using custom phone features on the same line as a fax machine can lead to several potential drawbacks. These include temporary interruptions or disruptions in fax transmission and reception, especially if the custom feature's signal interferes with the fax machine's operation. For instance, if a call waiting signal comes through the line while the fax machine is sending or receiving a fax, it can temporarily halt the transmission or reception process. This can be particularly problematic for businesses that rely on timely fax communication.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, Brother's ECM (Error Correction Mode) feature can be very helpful. ECM is designed to detect and correct errors that may occur during fax transmission or reception, thereby improving the reliability and accuracy of fax operations. By using ECM, the fax machine can better handle the interference from custom phone features, ensuring that fax communications are not disrupted. This feature is particularly useful in environments where multiple devices and services are sharing the same telephone line, as it helps maintain the integrity of fax transmissions despite potential line noise or interference.","source":"data/test/mfcj1800dw.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[381,379,380,384,211,210,221,388,218,169,166,382,180,215,224,197,258,196,329,99,345,4,186,3,213,330,217,5,101,349,390,392,439,188,339,377,467,165,174,233,248,385,468,168,374,375,457,163,167,191,195,216,243,247,155,170,244,328,376,193,198,225,297,411,178,181,378,391,393,20,94,347,92,150,219,245,343,346,463,482,18,162,171,172,179,246,314,344,400,177,212,214,372,373,423,458,461,470,472,2,47,184,185,192,222,253,322,353,428,438,456,462,80,183,223,351,445,479,6,17,95,175,176,327,340,355,363,386,394,134,137,234,287,315,421,465,82,83,97,232,280,466,59,63,208,226,227,267,451,481,15,105,141,242,250,318,406,408,429,460,78,151,187,194,220,239,265,272,331,415,450,10,16,125,157,209,251,252,270,301,364,409,412,444,459,13,104,118,135,158,173,189,202,249,399,434,25,145,156,205,236,260,275,278,319,348,350,365,405,427,435,68,149,182,241,263,395,417,418,420,464,48,75,89,115,117,129,136,164,199,235,238,266,281,284,285,309,324,325,354,401,410,1,32,46,111,201,231,240,279,317,326,342,352,356,368,402,416,431,446,452,76,103,112,128,160,190,255,261,264,271,277,305,321,332,383,413,419,432,437,483,12,43,44,49,85,109,113,123,132,237,299,307,316,407,426,433,447,453,473,29,36,40,50,52,61,62,70,131,147,159,203,268,311,313,370,398,403,436,30,81,88,102,140,143,146,282,358,369,371,389,469,54,58,90,106,228,310,334,367,26,33,114,120,161,200,291,14,37,56,139,204,207,276,283,289,320,387,440,478,19,34,154,259,449,475,477,485,38,66,73,77,86,107,153,206,295,323,333,414,425,442,8,87,152,303,306,396,60,65,286,142,293,296,341,359,362,28,71,257,269,288,448,487,22,57,91,302,360,361,366,64,79,93,486,9,11,74,121,397,404,443,454,476,45,84,298,312,338,35,51,148,337,424,455,480,55,67,69,119,130,304,335,430,98,122,357,254,274,471,42,53,96,108,138,41,24,144,21,100,273,308,72,336,422,116,292,294,39,256,474,23,27,230,484,31,127,229,300,441,126,110,124,133,290,262,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Its simplicity and clear distinction from the standard ring pattern make it highly recognizable. The short-short pattern consists of two short rings, while the long-long pattern consists of two long rings. These patterns are significantly different from the standard ring pattern, which typically consists of a series of short and long rings that alternate.\n\nThe short-short pattern is particularly easy to distinguish because it is composed of two identical short rings, which are less common in standard ring patterns. Similarly, the long-long pattern stands out due to its two identical long rings. These distinctive features ensure that the user can quickly identify the incoming call as a fax or voice call, even if they are not actively listening to the rings.\n\nIn summary, Ring Pattern 1 is the most suitable for users seeking a distinctive ring that is easily distinguishable from the standard pattern due to its clear and unique characteristics.","source":"data/test/mfcj1800dw.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[211,213,212,458,210,21,218,166,214,416,165,209,350,4,113,219,382,346,82,457,164,193,8,226,380,102,131,249,411,168,345,420,64,80,115,138,349,121,197,224,425,436,479,6,126,95,117,363,465,377,70,125,143,297,76,114,124,188,277,374,97,287,379,344,422,478,10,145,264,268,466,470,127,128,198,324,385,91,137,167,169,196,481,56,81,295,378,472,348,459,17,37,52,376,73,99,100,109,139,146,305,375,78,347,355,364,123,216,225,136,162,258,265,291,392,112,132,147,187,234,269,337,365,390,414,2,5,50,51,294,296,393,430,473,36,43,83,101,135,191,195,243,310,381,384,7,69,129,194,432,462,292,372,406,419,208,271,321,339,435,461,40,54,88,90,450,480,28,32,44,65,72,75,110,153,220,289,343,383,403,423,456,460,464,468,120,141,176,286,301,327,333,3,48,67,111,140,290,335,404,34,86,144,151,163,248,412,16,20,33,47,87,152,217,255,272,318,18,261,266,312,38,49,66,68,79,155,204,229,299,311,368,369,370,388,400,401,482,106,158,186,284,319,402,428,429,486,19,89,122,189,325,356,367,487,185,228,288,373,394,15,74,92,118,154,156,386,391,13,25,171,172,173,192,215,247,313,405,440,445,22,108,242,358,431,483,9,46,98,133,201,230,244,254,285,303,316,421,442,454,463,23,31,35,42,96,107,148,205,253,278,336,362,396,408,485,24,39,59,227,342,397,427,475,484,41,45,60,142,250,257,371,426,26,53,55,239,246,309,366,424,446,467,471,12,317,407,58,150,202,237,238,274,280,413,438,443,476,1,178,240,276,293,315,395,410,263,444,448,451,11,63,84,103,130,267,281,322,323,387,398,409,418,439,447,61,93,119,30,57,160,231,262,275,181,183,200,235,236,307,351,399,77,85,207,221,302,360,157,203,223,259,270,332,338,29,104,273,283,329,417,453,455,14,180,170,174,179,326,331,341,433,441,161,306,330,334,415,474,71,105,190,206,328,27,134,182,256,359,449,175,177,298,300,389,434,241,353,361,437,477,279,308,352,340,469,62,116,245,452,304,149,94,260,199,251,354,282,159,233,320,357,184,232,252,222,314],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Additionally, if you're trying to find photos within a specific range of ratings, you may need to jump through multiple ratings to cover the desired range.\n","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[622,566,518,617,563,311,511,561,680,87,521,4,180,309,184,618,6,565,187,303,562,615,679,623,301,522,532,533,312,519,621,836,516,627,692,859,875,319,689,910,529,572,607,614,514,564,575,580,619,842,631,634,812,512,546,557,513,624,628,9,411,527,543,569,630,651,19,318,525,531,574,578,714,877,191,196,310,333,608,743,7,197,335,523,666,668,694,721,786,834,843,119,395,534,596,633,636,195,216,255,308,331,548,573,576,893,218,332,412,413,554,571,696,699,813,852,854,120,283,286,337,343,552,678,5,73,315,317,601,603,629,313,324,459,550,556,559,592,595,626,83,277,320,322,398,590,591,660,794,856,885,125,127,258,328,330,558,612,664,894,110,179,185,267,334,541,567,798,853,121,189,393,517,535,549,570,616,640,658,691,693,787,857,194,326,341,387,493,537,577,582,598,600,609,665,695,701,708,791,835,881,122,124,186,316,376,381,502,515,520,545,579,594,613,672,739,814,892,85,91,108,138,153,214,291,544,606,663,681,707,810,846,860,141,159,181,321,348,402,602,653,656,670,677,57,90,94,104,284,306,327,344,366,391,415,524,581,593,605,611,625,675,753,776,792,849,855,3,10,84,112,161,254,279,323,336,356,463,468,586,646,654,858,886,102,202,266,268,325,357,365,446,471,597,635,878,49,117,167,193,217,228,539,547,568,587,589,620,722,731,736,775,821,872,29,39,109,123,205,269,280,282,290,295,377,401,530,536,588,599,642,682,706,741,763,848,868,876,898,50,81,136,139,152,190,232,235,262,281,299,367,373,382,414,498,509,555,632,674,715,718,729,760,767,815,911,132,219,221,227,239,253,273,274,338,350,384,460,479,481,508,697,724,758,880,101,154,157,188,203,211,374,380,496,499,553,662,700,732,747,768,782,796,799,869,897,913,25,28,51,107,118,199,230,233,292,345,354,406,417,424,430,501,669,710,757,777,789,790,797,803,832,888,95,96,158,163,213,342,432,480,526,551,583,604,837,99,113,114,140,171,215,287,364,408,435,440,483,703,709,733,745,820,34,60,69,111,151,160,183,209,298,304,359,362,389,416,486,610,702,711,847,92,129,240,329,452,466,641,698,805,807,8,31,38,88,137,192,260,353,487,510,79,93,106,207,307,349,372,497,500,819,212,236,278,407,410,478,542,650,661,688,806,56,76,100,142,206,224,305,355,392,433,495,652,655,673,705,723,870,52,294,404,436,447,457,560,667,738,764,808,26,71,98,115,241,243,250,259,340,361,378,540,730,795,850,895,900,15,53,270,285,300,371,420,637,683,717,725,742,778,785,866,889,891,902,916,21,116,174,198,244,314,375,394,584,671,783,802,896,86,156,275,276,360,368,421,423,441,454,491,494,766,771,801,18,442,451,467,538,645,647,690,713,770,788,804,887,901,134,289,456,488,657,751,809,914,155,234,237,242,379,450,506,712,727,840,46,170,172,261,386,426,428,482,687,719,752,818,89,103,182,246,352,358,383,390,399,405,429,473,503,648,735,746,769,800,851,917,82,126,164,168,288,296,302,419,528,874,909,54,80,223,248,264,293,438,458,477,772,774,816,862,864,97,131,148,165,249,257,388,409,431,470,676,761,823,833,883,130,147,200,263,272,297,418,485,585,720,737,826,867,251,339,475,490,639,740,762,773,1,12,45,128,173,208,225,448,793,863,879,222,229,396,474,861,58,162,403,465,489,492,643,704,765,61,105,178,256,385,434,443,507,659,744,784,871,72,422,686,726,750,873,33,62,135,204,210,346,455,464,716,781,908,48,175,427,734,829,838,47,150,245,252,363,425,453,22,169,220,445,469,476,649,685,748,845,865,40,43,484,505,728,844,16,226,265,271,754,780,830,899,68,145,238,27,44,397,461,906,20,149,247,449,472,817,177,779,919,462,756,839,907,23,70,77,439,822,35,176,828,11,32,37,74,78,644,684,755,827,17,24,133,146,444,825,905,42,66,890,918,369,30,201,882,904,166,351,75,370,400,437,2,504,759,63,67,144,231,347,841,41,64,915,749,13,36,638,811,59,65,824,831,14,912,884,903,55,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Instead, it continues from the last sequential file number used on Card 1. This is illustrated in the diagram where the file numbering on Card 2 starts from the next sequential number after Card 1's last file number, which is 0051. This means that the file numbering on Card 2 will be 0052, maintaining the continuous numbering from Card 1.\n\nThe key difference is that creating a new folder on Card 1 resets the file numbering to 0001, while switching to a new card (Card 2) does not reset the numbering, allowing for continuous file numbering across cards.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[770,769,768,771,8,761,760,764,772,767,778,766,875,781,602,418,565,51,697,765,775,777,774,812,48,569,808,807,546,868,287,836,46,567,269,806,870,252,362,680,763,810,695,22,102,571,608,741,378,886,358,550,696,815,279,306,485,540,278,286,556,561,701,7,572,576,190,303,611,613,361,588,637,825,899,164,479,733,50,171,513,549,552,570,618,820,867,873,290,320,579,655,809,817,480,742,773,172,239,293,296,318,386,457,476,554,731,866,387,703,852,322,441,577,677,751,753,785,240,596,699,818,862,892,74,75,165,244,354,396,539,715,823,184,364,416,475,478,574,682,725,750,850,44,47,87,149,185,248,291,357,482,500,506,547,700,734,743,748,874,120,183,241,321,453,559,657,744,752,819,841,878,16,135,281,304,399,414,514,647,689,694,714,721,735,747,851,28,40,79,186,196,297,388,413,491,532,568,597,612,632,639,839,865,910,59,112,127,250,254,341,587,590,600,645,860,58,131,182,282,365,477,698,724,786,894,896,3,49,54,63,140,274,324,326,417,426,452,511,620,666,727,762,780,883,34,305,328,340,496,497,509,516,557,621,654,679,688,717,783,800,856,187,330,342,343,372,427,510,580,623,707,729,755,757,821,831,864,898,6,233,238,276,300,315,327,350,390,415,472,543,617,732,797,848,858,31,95,101,123,170,198,199,232,339,345,359,484,599,610,683,690,796,801,863,885,906,916,2,81,132,251,294,323,467,537,573,635,681,702,889,4,56,173,191,224,253,277,283,338,421,481,508,518,595,609,640,648,650,693,745,787,793,794,845,861,888,33,147,155,157,215,266,273,299,366,384,422,450,451,619,718,738,813,842,847,36,159,205,222,353,455,501,583,705,843,849,897,89,128,174,179,188,203,216,218,298,380,385,423,424,425,459,493,505,517,592,624,628,642,652,675,686,814,832,855,114,151,156,177,181,332,376,377,431,490,605,799,846,871,55,104,280,288,430,445,461,519,566,606,651,736,788,834,835,838,26,45,116,161,200,212,217,223,292,346,349,360,460,502,507,548,563,578,581,684,730,776,822,57,62,73,118,124,163,193,213,220,228,236,333,435,436,466,495,527,560,564,598,607,636,661,676,791,792,907,913,99,221,234,356,382,407,412,443,468,544,616,656,710,711,712,790,826,830,833,902,10,66,144,162,219,245,403,428,463,483,488,531,716,726,740,784,880,891,901,30,121,125,134,237,489,541,586,601,670,746,795,816,904,12,32,35,43,52,84,145,242,265,375,381,420,464,523,524,558,622,672,709,779,798,840,869,11,17,25,60,92,146,194,195,227,247,285,331,336,367,393,395,437,499,525,704,789,805,859,908,918,42,98,106,169,255,337,348,536,584,614,633,663,719,759,837,872,877,130,153,167,189,257,259,268,272,289,295,301,311,312,319,401,442,591,630,660,692,706,723,804,824,909,9,85,137,246,256,313,379,394,402,404,446,447,470,534,562,604,827,919,5,64,80,86,129,197,225,229,230,352,398,400,406,486,515,535,551,575,589,634,641,668,737,782,828,915,90,105,108,143,148,175,202,231,235,307,374,512,545,585,615,653,665,674,900,61,115,117,126,160,207,243,262,284,317,370,405,504,529,629,1,65,176,210,264,371,391,432,526,758,914,38,103,206,275,314,369,392,433,454,538,594,649,685,691,802,905,70,133,178,325,434,440,520,593,603,664,671,749,803,911,39,82,100,122,192,270,410,411,444,643,678,94,150,166,201,214,368,667,722,876,890,77,88,93,119,139,142,249,383,448,465,474,522,533,673,713,844,78,111,209,344,373,658,687,754,829,895,23,113,152,158,168,226,498,669,18,29,71,180,389,492,582,659,879,19,24,37,53,110,154,271,355,439,449,555,625,644,728,109,136,204,334,363,429,438,473,503,553,739,756,881,884,887,208,211,302,308,351,458,469,917,267,309,471,521,542,720,857,893,15,20,91,631,83,494,708,811,67,335,408,260,462,68,419,854,14,69,96,107,530,13,21,141,261,456,626,853,903,97,263,627,662,138,76,316,329,397,646,310,409,528,912,72,258,27,882,487,638,41,347],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

While other modes like Panoramic Shot or Group Photo could potentially work, they don't align as closely with the goal of maximizing depth of field and scenic detail across a wide vista.\n","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[110,111,100,109,285,498,353,112,219,888,132,277,101,131,193,205,501,739,129,786,81,89,230,323,758,121,345,349,203,587,596,694,416,541,57,499,894,103,127,542,588,892,291,107,115,562,608,885,126,236,257,509,519,104,255,579,666,891,597,610,510,518,607,632,114,119,120,142,374,537,105,227,287,383,384,535,586,624,402,536,590,613,692,701,401,551,602,611,34,299,337,348,386,534,578,609,612,693,123,139,290,373,532,665,872,889,31,113,128,152,307,573,94,97,117,124,552,672,887,71,93,118,99,108,215,239,366,433,508,543,580,663,670,836,96,305,595,664,18,424,458,598,913,83,91,92,134,367,153,186,228,315,417,437,674,130,461,619,76,174,321,451,547,98,122,158,252,336,630,213,224,262,308,346,372,392,909,106,154,181,194,196,288,432,468,599,35,296,350,355,415,486,560,886,19,84,146,231,387,395,446,521,668,787,904,908,238,243,406,453,3,27,32,176,188,211,223,316,320,407,434,438,680,895,137,140,218,264,298,334,359,726,789,871,162,179,195,275,306,376,445,470,538,795,72,87,151,180,248,343,354,388,601,136,185,235,269,286,339,418,439,503,539,559,604,869,906,116,144,157,313,457,487,533,90,170,232,242,283,311,342,460,469,524,95,133,217,225,340,450,500,502,681,737,832,898,905,8,135,192,202,246,261,272,274,289,419,443,522,528,634,863,875,30,52,164,178,184,199,214,341,454,623,868,187,206,254,265,333,379,575,760,796,849,870,75,150,197,253,258,260,280,281,309,332,467,697,699,833,877,4,50,125,168,284,435,459,585,714,791,794,827,838,842,867,20,28,148,161,183,212,241,244,293,322,324,338,422,471,523,568,662,776,165,182,204,240,247,360,380,391,440,481,483,485,778,878,38,62,245,278,331,381,473,496,540,622,633,695,715,754,826,149,169,229,233,279,335,427,455,464,529,618,628,688,755,777,835,874,5,17,156,200,250,251,294,476,505,574,584,615,679,719,825,828,829,910,65,74,189,198,221,267,268,273,282,319,344,429,449,526,700,738,837,899,177,216,295,318,420,425,472,474,488,507,545,557,605,621,648,751,775,830,897,2,6,37,42,102,147,297,317,325,475,527,531,689,907,60,61,270,301,347,352,382,393,423,430,431,462,463,491,567,626,750,766,816,25,143,190,249,314,357,364,398,426,428,436,466,495,511,606,696,782,840,10,26,58,69,85,207,226,263,312,358,390,452,497,530,603,722,790,820,864,1,40,47,222,259,365,389,411,477,480,492,493,563,660,675,736,843,903,16,54,77,82,159,276,400,441,442,444,447,490,504,614,616,709,797,857,896,901,73,292,300,329,412,544,581,650,659,732,767,802,818,821,844,856,859,866,63,86,163,385,558,617,690,698,711,860,862,45,46,53,59,78,175,201,210,234,378,394,396,465,546,548,553,561,571,653,661,793,839,167,208,361,405,408,478,520,525,554,564,569,572,582,636,651,685,702,798,824,855,861,881,893,911,21,64,141,160,166,303,369,479,494,550,834,44,80,266,351,482,489,512,592,641,678,703,761,900,902,22,68,145,172,514,549,640,684,808,66,171,362,594,629,669,687,712,763,858,23,88,368,371,576,686,691,764,788,810,819,138,302,330,421,570,643,677,779,780,781,792,809,854,43,155,220,404,413,566,577,716,717,721,683,708,735,743,748,772,785,812,375,448,516,555,647,823,29,173,565,725,822,879,48,271,326,456,556,768,771,815,916,24,36,67,328,397,409,515,631,706,730,817,880,237,399,620,658,851,914,49,310,484,517,583,718,801,873,883,7,15,327,649,720,884,33,39,506,671,765,806,191,209,656,644,654,733,783,14,256,377,403,414,600,682,740,51,635,710,747,769,9,356,410,645,79,304,363,625,627,673,593,655,713,745,749,865,13,642,707,724,742,753,876,646,728,11,591,667,513,589,705,723,704,731,773,841,55,370,752,813,657,762,744,800,805,807,56,70,756,846,853,12,639,652,729,741,774,770,784,676,637,757,811,919,41,734,746,850,804,727,799,890,814,912,803,848,852,638,845,759,918,882,915,831,917,847],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This noise could manifest as grainy or speckled areas, especially noticeable in low-light conditions or when the correction is most needed.\n","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[260,584,259,195,409,299,336,264,585,231,269,127,206,219,261,437,392,417,452,121,218,26,118,53,278,337,263,334,120,265,354,108,152,199,367,119,224,262,387,335,604,318,869,109,214,221,266,313,316,449,458,460,605,112,459,474,76,116,162,253,373,414,699,876,95,126,213,257,286,371,606,754,879,86,96,122,258,267,273,408,447,471,607,799,871,894,28,51,350,365,500,611,681,85,179,237,268,270,298,380,451,456,493,619,695,755,866,888,90,200,249,340,415,740,229,232,291,511,545,583,810,878,4,113,170,175,490,502,776,5,25,223,239,87,157,158,431,540,610,801,863,165,183,461,569,629,893,114,296,372,688,701,6,132,700,368,412,919,716,201,275,280,407,434,864,872,58,212,243,301,308,358,381,144,154,194,488,508,513,523,576,774,865,125,147,581,890,235,359,399,475,491,844,68,69,236,406,463,571,592,613,737,10,29,72,117,238,433,438,516,601,636,753,791,45,106,159,166,248,589,784,797,825,868,107,168,174,338,413,445,470,577,780,81,103,307,479,486,637,7,19,404,496,497,618,886,889,124,140,211,375,391,532,639,874,24,135,137,226,357,398,867,891,2,34,50,100,374,444,524,586,628,687,877,882,57,66,123,177,205,483,543,546,597,620,768,837,12,23,79,80,134,225,242,256,287,403,478,495,777,245,254,364,469,537,600,711,722,289,675,679,800,826,905,54,164,361,370,416,446,454,587,875,82,172,519,579,627,842,110,167,353,506,560,588,805,8,89,215,230,252,395,405,480,489,522,626,678,750,873,94,160,240,281,477,482,512,514,794,803,833,142,290,315,397,487,650,662,744,798,843,862,887,910,18,47,115,149,356,443,654,748,811,840,881,883,255,272,448,515,558,602,603,743,757,775,831,852,44,145,246,435,507,596,616,630,674,751,128,182,202,528,652,756,762,793,796,812,821,823,27,186,227,288,317,326,331,333,772,362,442,544,593,696,726,105,139,228,274,329,418,453,686,760,816,839,870,3,11,203,271,455,468,481,549,556,591,666,735,752,802,832,39,92,102,150,241,310,323,339,378,424,529,550,20,56,61,153,181,185,450,457,517,530,590,617,702,60,151,430,792,820,855,93,156,197,421,527,691,817,141,222,282,344,396,426,440,441,472,476,734,758,789,901,904,75,83,129,247,320,328,330,432,621,719,804,822,824,277,295,420,427,531,672,761,763,783,836,858,896,32,91,184,193,297,302,494,566,659,728,787,795,818,31,422,428,429,467,473,660,747,781,790,33,65,84,143,173,250,341,466,609,614,633,918,67,74,101,342,423,526,598,653,658,713,742,835,16,187,198,216,324,325,376,536,623,685,697,715,718,730,813,892,903,73,171,304,322,327,360,366,383,425,572,624,643,819,828,861,906,35,52,180,309,321,343,369,384,402,503,547,622,651,656,693,733,749,815,880,900,916,13,191,220,436,485,553,669,732,746,909,41,70,155,161,345,388,525,612,644,649,36,98,104,136,188,276,311,632,759,769,834,902,30,38,319,382,439,505,557,567,647,724,727,788,856,885,913,914,279,635,838,49,133,146,210,283,292,501,521,539,631,642,663,689,770,841,845,42,169,233,411,484,492,667,741,767,771,1,14,55,77,217,464,520,534,552,565,608,646,655,773,782,189,284,348,582,677,729,739,807,830,9,88,148,176,196,303,306,332,386,504,555,574,625,648,725,745,764,895,111,130,312,419,533,575,657,690,710,738,778,859,912,15,379,615,676,684,694,714,765,786,857,899,48,300,349,673,731,897,908,131,535,580,640,698,706,717,898,71,138,163,190,244,251,462,559,570,705,709,785,809,827,853,17,22,62,78,99,465,548,704,43,207,285,305,355,385,394,554,568,671,723,806,347,363,390,561,208,293,352,518,562,563,594,638,720,829,917,21,294,551,564,573,664,665,683,692,37,40,510,680,814,851,854,911,46,97,849,64,234,346,377,645,808,63,393,410,707,59,389,538,578,736,766,703,192,541,670,682,599,661,721,779,846,314,499,542,634,668,847,509,884,209,351,400,401,850,595,860,204,708,848,498,178,907,641,712,915],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What are the differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds between the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter in still photo shooting, and how do these settings impact the use of flash?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[908],"raw_output":"","pred":"In still photo shooting, the mechanical shutter offers a wider range of shutter speeds compared to the electronic 1st curtain shutter. The mechanical shutter allows for settings from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, including bulb mode, with a set increment of 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop. The X-sync speed for the mechanical shutter is 1/200 seconds. In contrast, the electronic 1st curtain shutter has a narrower range of shutter speeds, from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, also including bulb mode, with the same set increment of 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop. The X-sync speed for the electronic 1st curtain shutter is 1/250 seconds.\n\nThese differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds impact the use of flash in several ways. The wider range of shutter speeds for the mechanical shutter allows for more flexibility in capturing fast-moving subjects or in low-light conditions, which can be crucial for flash photography. The higher X-sync speed of 1/200 seconds for the mechanical shutter enables the use of flash synchronization at faster shutter speeds, which can help in freezing motion and reducing camera shake. However, the electronic 1st curtain shutter, with its narrower shutter speed range and higher X-sync speed of 1/250 seconds, may limit the ability to use flash at very fast shutter speeds, potentially affecting the ability to capture fast-moving subjects with flash effectively.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[908,161,162,910,174,177,298,299,170,869,164,384,163,344,870,179,500,868,165,499,150,286,218,181,291,894,899,293,3,294,296,887,4,224,905,906,184,223,297,874,195,339,147,826,116,152,204,132,172,336,417,825,840,131,144,312,681,135,502,113,157,387,688,830,833,838,867,892,133,145,173,180,313,388,75,156,212,167,215,308,185,301,348,350,904,137,140,338,349,72,74,176,96,159,199,219,269,432,791,824,837,885,206,821,898,149,380,849,122,130,143,155,295,352,818,909,5,115,136,300,335,102,211,503,843,57,175,198,221,316,345,871,913,50,168,205,333,828,886,889,891,114,134,169,253,138,171,376,872,151,318,395,83,202,213,226,282,337,434,829,77,119,139,158,207,216,407,35,285,394,726,127,178,355,382,460,835,153,186,209,343,393,405,633,112,182,214,274,341,367,392,739,183,200,266,76,81,94,277,278,281,836,91,324,386,419,492,795,832,20,193,275,381,383,841,290,303,442,596,630,2,89,187,210,486,615,789,839,34,80,95,188,228,241,248,262,307,311,317,323,374,437,469,866,106,121,203,267,268,276,391,471,787,806,33,90,107,120,148,160,217,321,418,732,817,897,31,87,92,98,192,231,279,280,707,93,97,100,283,284,496,700,822,108,146,190,334,340,875,32,104,189,232,314,385,433,446,458,501,808,110,287,406,429,454,476,508,888,99,124,166,257,330,342,411,450,459,485,541,579,7,85,239,420,489,28,264,320,487,616,8,73,105,117,118,390,641,763,842,884,18,225,265,315,463,488,807,834,878,61,70,84,103,288,322,474,493,504,674,809,6,17,123,194,201,230,252,309,326,328,438,447,509,511,661,788,907,67,208,449,738,810,863,880,25,78,451,786,815,877,254,365,366,416,436,445,587,624,666,895,26,42,111,443,475,675,733,758,760,38,109,222,234,235,260,423,428,430,461,512,519,537,557,590,725,794,54,101,196,242,261,271,289,319,331,864,914,86,129,351,507,577,585,653,659,59,125,233,247,258,378,422,431,481,667,697,711,762,812,823,126,236,246,306,346,353,531,544,197,396,468,483,540,621,628,844,858,82,237,368,371,441,505,873,240,372,373,421,425,426,455,497,792,27,154,229,347,424,453,631,636,642,677,698,71,88,227,238,245,305,327,332,427,477,597,614,663,737,896,244,250,357,413,495,612,651,715,816,820,854,325,401,440,467,498,543,607,632,695,736,800,802,354,400,457,464,568,618,669,671,673,742,778,790,797,9,142,369,479,480,526,528,529,539,583,634,660,679,734,798,805,911,60,220,259,439,466,708,743,65,255,270,272,273,359,482,538,640,683,689,705,717,718,727,783,304,399,402,462,470,490,513,514,516,527,534,542,582,603,617,620,622,645,676,703,710,714,752,776,22,364,409,452,465,472,494,520,545,561,576,588,602,662,709,735,744,745,793,819,52,403,525,535,604,649,650,657,685,690,721,755,761,861,912,79,243,398,518,532,567,601,639,652,654,682,731,30,128,478,484,510,572,600,629,648,655,680,722,764,777,21,51,63,435,448,536,562,635,701,704,712,741,766,801,902,916,251,444,560,605,637,706,730,782,785,827,883,16,191,414,558,569,608,647,658,672,699,740,813,881,45,46,62,404,523,625,696,724,831,862,893,903,19,24,360,379,491,552,686,694,719,723,751,767,846,853,855,900,10,44,64,370,410,456,584,586,609,665,670,720,746,753,799,901,36,292,329,412,524,613,729,771,40,69,408,415,473,549,578,589,716,775,780,796,851,310,517,565,573,598,623,643,656,687,693,702,748,749,754,768,804,23,43,47,49,515,547,556,559,591,362,522,530,551,553,570,574,575,592,610,668,249,377,521,580,581,664,678,747,857,859,141,550,611,644,692,781,845,11,15,58,68,619,765,784,865,1,56,571,546,564,594,595,713,848,256,506,533,554,599,684,750,779,860,66,356,626,774,847,850,555,691,856,263,375,563,890,29,358,361,728,772,548,593,606,757,759,876,53,566,769,770,773,882,389,646,37,39,811,879,915,919,852,302,756,41,14,917,397,814,627,48,13,363,803,12,55,638,918],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is evident from the final output (A+B), where the pages are folded along the short edge, with page 5 at the top and page 2 at the bottom.\n\n4. **Binding**: The pages were then bound along the short edge, creating a booklet-like structure. The final output shows the pages neatly folded and bound, with the text facing inward, ready to be read.\n\nThis combination of settings allowed for efficient use of paper by printing on both sides and organizing the pages into a compact booklet format.","source":"data/test/mfcj1010dw.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[89,70,82,81,73,77,515,69,136,137,503,3,64,74,83,66,68,84,86,362,143,173,71,410,133,138,363,126,141,139,88,91,129,2,132,48,92,506,174,411,456,119,51,49,76,419,50,152,492,15,478,65,134,165,408,166,135,476,487,211,467,486,507,87,93,120,142,178,234,457,140,153,208,483,517,39,90,209,407,412,128,207,491,94,130,210,495,37,148,160,497,513,514,520,529,455,474,498,527,530,43,103,118,161,249,54,55,104,123,131,149,199,276,279,417,528,5,101,271,482,502,30,107,154,172,206,240,406,17,24,57,121,155,162,197,201,413,454,274,292,349,477,512,27,56,171,175,180,215,261,336,466,52,106,168,184,202,204,221,62,117,127,146,167,182,510,203,219,275,440,449,484,505,40,45,105,108,147,156,214,239,277,308,323,386,416,443,522,79,98,429,475,4,36,41,47,116,372,415,59,111,170,179,217,354,383,489,97,144,195,235,324,364,371,414,418,430,459,462,6,34,38,100,278,436,448,458,157,193,198,259,352,370,378,384,387,424,452,479,488,493,504,532,46,264,267,356,16,18,35,58,80,169,293,302,346,420,447,22,29,53,72,189,223,253,450,500,75,231,280,357,388,397,445,42,158,159,226,272,283,285,382,409,425,61,176,245,282,287,366,438,460,13,21,232,233,241,355,396,428,431,432,433,490,508,509,516,531,28,177,187,188,191,151,164,224,229,250,281,297,338,393,472,526,10,33,112,113,216,255,319,337,359,361,380,392,468,481,67,150,163,194,200,270,300,353,401,446,453,521,96,222,251,260,322,347,365,375,404,426,471,20,44,102,246,248,262,314,339,368,376,377,394,395,399,423,19,23,183,228,236,243,244,501,85,225,263,286,299,360,398,444,257,298,331,124,190,212,242,304,333,385,442,523,524,26,99,115,145,192,254,268,291,341,374,441,12,31,63,334,358,402,427,434,499,8,9,326,422,470,511,95,230,345,405,25,125,181,519,535,238,288,295,332,391,469,494,496,196,307,342,367,473,533,186,258,303,330,220,305,316,379,381,464,485,114,306,309,318,451,14,213,227,237,266,335,340,344,525,78,109,110,122,265,296,313,315,437,252,273,312,348,389,421,301,317,327,328,351,32,289,311,329,185,290,373,465,1,218,284,294,320,480,518,534,310,205,247,321,435,439,60,11,390,350,369,325,403,463,7,269,256,343,400,461],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

{"question":"What are the differences between the \"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" and \"True Gray\" scan types, and in what scenarios might you choose one over the other?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[119],"raw_output":"","pred":"The \"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" and \"True Gray\" scan types differ in their approach to creating grayscale images. \n\n\"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" uses a method called error diffusion to create simulated gray images without using true gray dots. This technique involves distributing the error from one pixel to neighboring pixels, resulting in a smooth gradient. It's particularly useful for photographic images or graphics where a smooth transition between shades is desired. However, this method can sometimes introduce visible artifacts, especially in areas with fine details or sharp transitions.\n\n\"True Gray,\" on the other hand, uses up to 256 shades of gray to scan the image. This method is more accurate and provides a higher level of detail and smoothness, especially in areas with subtle variations in shading. It's ideal for high-quality graphics and text where precise color representation is crucial.\n\nYou might choose \"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" when you need a quick and smooth gradient for less detailed images, or when you want to avoid the potential artifacts associated with true gray.

{"question":"What is the maximum ambient temperature for operating the TE 2000-22 cordless breaker, and how does this compare to the maximum storage temperature? Discuss the implications of these temperature limits on the tool's performance and longevity in extreme working conditions.","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[26],"raw_output":"","pred":"The TE 2000-22 cordless breaker can operate in ambient temperatures ranging from -17°C to 60°C. This wide range allows for use in various environments, from cold to warm conditions. However, the maximum storage temperature is significantly higher, ranging from -20°C to 70°C. This indicates that the tool can be stored in a wider temperature range than it can operate in.\n\nThe implications of these temperature limits on the tool's performance and longevity are substantial. Operating the tool in temperatures outside its specified range can lead to reduced performance, increased wear, and potential damage. For instance, operating in excessively cold temperatures can cause the battery to perform poorly, leading to shorter run times and reduced power output. Conversely, operating in very hot temperatures can cause overheating, which can damage internal components and reduce the battery's lifespan.\n\nIn extreme conditions, the tool's longevity is also compromised. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can degrade the battery's chemistry, leading to a decrease in capacity and an increase in self-discharge rates. Similarly, cold temperatures can harden the battery's electrolyte, making it less efficient and potentially causing it to freeze. Therefore, maintaining the tool within its recommended temperature limits is crucial for optimal performance and extended lifespan.","source":"data/test/nuron_te_200022.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[26,88,14,63,172,225,75,199,124,212,38,82,50,76,148,112,136,160,57,231,166,186,59,10,20,29,5,192,32,44,94,100,107,144,181,8,69,1,60,218,11,23,179,28,201,205,24,142,178,22,154,67,203,187,30,42,51,84,95,101,182,183,189,196,79,174,40,156,34,98,188,150,193,132,162,190,9,12,110,185,73,92,164,74,104,145,18,85,46,120,15,80,137,21,113,168,169,195,197,16,58,102,152,41,61,66,118,157,175,158,176,180,214,64,35,184,194,45,96,130,134,204,210,217,83,222,54,70,90,97,114,121,213,219,25,49,91,209,33,202,47,62,71,220,39,105,125,227,78,93,17,65,108,126,143,232,3,77,99,127,133,135,171,216,37,48,53,87,226,55,72,86,111,19,89,109,119,138,149,155,200,223,224,230,52,103,206,13,27,36,131,147,208,228,161,170,117,153,128,215,229,68,159,163,207,221,140,122,139,43,146,4,116,56,81,129,177,106,151,191,2,123,141,211,7,115,167,31,173,236,198,165,6,233,234,235],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

While not explicitly mentioned in the text, this screen would provide a visual confirmation of whether the system is on or off.\n\nThese visual cues help the driver quickly identify when the Road Departure Mitigation system is active, allowing them to take appropriate action if needed.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[530,533,134,139,166,167,135,537,111,531,391,532,113,33,504,112,536,770,534,535,222,605,443,48,555,49,20,170,476,511,561,19,213,393,10,34,165,212,214,509,574,470,216,556,161,437,575,159,160,501,542,122,162,477,599,141,454,563,643,71,201,129,521,527,17,101,123,420,466,522,622,157,471,168,92,117,625,685,734,441,502,507,729,126,127,154,580,164,481,591,259,267,486,629,108,482,485,118,128,179,264,328,540,721,104,155,169,356,490,500,632,645,705,116,188,377,462,492,268,474,526,631,728,140,313,317,137,178,512,618,120,131,276,461,541,578,628,719,183,320,378,467,560,581,637,655,254,321,392,403,424,425,439,460,469,480,495,508,682,37,114,153,156,209,257,478,483,516,525,570,766,105,142,152,196,207,329,390,515,520,577,593,710,274,423,601,636,769,115,243,255,294,472,506,524,565,592,644,660,768,15,29,30,56,93,121,136,147,163,262,263,279,318,452,519,667,737,12,89,150,208,311,347,491,151,158,236,389,468,489,493,514,548,564,587,28,61,171,314,497,510,554,630,24,36,45,81,143,319,382,458,463,544,584,597,652,686,713,733,145,195,242,250,394,453,499,539,558,609,611,646,765,27,76,77,138,335,348,590,624,664,771,62,97,102,404,455,457,528,588,596,627,676,744,764,8,73,119,144,149,286,309,324,327,517,546,582,610,614,22,83,91,96,107,330,473,600,651,72,124,246,353,479,488,503,518,567,594,702,732,767,244,315,523,551,606,647,677,748,38,82,100,205,241,283,384,431,459,487,543,706,731,99,109,125,148,186,200,211,270,280,341,545,626,648,722,755,69,249,275,316,464,573,688,704,743,60,94,293,310,409,450,484,615,634,640,691,707,736,67,110,130,221,289,292,350,379,396,401,446,494,529,579,663,712,716,726,756,174,177,181,193,199,247,307,397,400,465,557,623,730,739,95,133,187,190,204,297,363,538,559,583,585,607,717,16,26,78,202,210,239,248,278,281,421,505,550,641,53,106,227,237,245,269,288,323,399,498,612,619,654,4,32,64,74,85,87,132,189,228,235,253,282,340,388,407,422,440,613,703,25,31,43,146,180,322,408,549,562,602,608,642,750,9,75,306,349,427,435,715,2,50,198,295,305,338,351,436,475,595,604,697,723,745,18,23,88,173,220,287,308,336,405,456,496,569,576,586,620,695,738,740,773,57,59,80,172,203,285,395,708,735,65,197,251,325,331,447,451,635,711,718,720,84,98,215,343,438,513,589,621,687,58,192,252,303,312,339,361,417,566,725,754,21,39,234,273,284,352,406,568,598,617,675,751,14,42,47,194,218,256,271,333,444,633,649,681,683,742,55,86,206,217,219,238,240,334,414,547,669,689,701,224,296,298,301,344,418,433,616,653,772,11,46,226,231,291,304,326,412,449,603,694,741,7,70,184,229,290,332,650,656,673,749,63,66,191,258,266,387,552,553,13,41,51,103,230,233,380,398,402,571,692,79,277,360,415,639,668,693,699,752,68,232,302,337,364,383,428,670,35,432,445,657,690,700,1,5,265,662,714,747,175,225,680,182,355,419,684,724,6,223,371,411,661,762,261,362,410,430,659,709,185,366,370,416,429,434,658,572,666,3,44,176,346,367,698,727,260,272,300,342,426,672,760,365,671,674,679,757,54,358,368,448,678,357,372,665,381,354,753,374,52,299,369,413,345,385,759,386,758,375,359,376,373,638,763,40,696,761,90,442,746],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This could lead to several issues:\n\n1. **Loss of cargo**: The trunk lid opening while driving could cause cargo to fall out, potentially causing accidents or damage to other vehicles.\n\n2. **Distraction**: The sudden movement of the trunk lid could distract the driver, leading to loss of control of the vehicle.\n\n3. **Injury**: The trunk lid might hit the driver or passengers if it opens unexpectedly, causing physical harm.\n\n4. **Malfunction**: The trunk opener mechanism could become damaged or malfunction, requiring costly repairs.\n\nThis concern relates to the vehicle's design in several ways:\n\n- **Location of the Trunk Opener**: The trunk opener is located on the driver's door, which is easily accessible while driving. This proximity increases the risk of accidental activation.\n\n- **Emergency Trunk Opener**: The presence of an emergency trunk opener, which is also on the driver's door, further increases the likelihood of accidental activation.\n\n- **Design of the Trunk Lid**: The trunk lid is designed to be opened and closed manually, which is a safety feature. However, the ease of activation by the trunk opener increases the risk of misuse.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the vehicle's design includes a warning message on the driver information interface when the trunk is not fully closed. This serves as a reminder to the driver to ensure the trunk is properly closed before driving.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[189,193,88,12,45,47,713,23,221,191,76,454,399,116,452,490,525,634,174,453,82,83,178,192,507,599,766,43,184,190,476,519,524,614,618,627,89,176,179,460,613,745,710,715,743,180,198,620,628,716,9,38,195,239,457,462,470,539,77,492,508,530,641,688,46,471,500,511,529,561,655,744,765,37,177,201,207,209,215,356,445,477,515,520,629,363,458,509,683,724,728,36,81,112,450,491,555,704,769,8,468,472,478,537,540,581,637,697,705,171,196,216,465,687,771,51,75,80,444,526,532,672,14,33,39,242,245,275,528,720,731,42,50,78,479,480,517,681,2,56,98,102,105,154,236,241,435,474,494,590,663,695,722,732,742,34,238,274,330,463,473,475,574,633,691,739,96,204,229,251,259,518,521,538,612,660,685,694,706,725,729,73,93,99,106,108,218,223,447,501,523,578,621,622,675,702,768,48,49,71,111,212,227,286,459,466,502,503,560,575,632,31,57,115,203,222,237,279,439,469,516,531,559,605,606,609,615,700,723,734,735,767,113,181,183,194,199,244,253,270,400,404,527,548,549,585,607,610,616,619,642,667,740,770,18,53,61,69,87,94,97,187,231,335,401,455,461,536,567,593,608,611,631,650,699,730,737,74,103,104,143,200,210,220,224,243,314,347,353,449,451,506,522,556,577,601,626,649,658,709,719,22,127,219,225,235,325,425,557,565,584,589,592,635,664,693,754,16,52,197,396,456,533,569,573,598,624,668,15,59,62,66,86,95,160,202,228,339,437,446,467,495,498,499,544,580,583,726,733,5,30,85,92,110,128,161,248,348,440,443,493,497,510,513,550,568,673,714,748,755,756,7,10,107,109,166,234,328,331,355,405,422,482,535,639,640,659,662,689,60,67,101,313,402,441,504,554,596,602,603,711,750,17,24,54,55,58,142,155,182,205,208,240,340,407,486,512,579,582,591,647,657,692,703,721,35,41,44,79,100,129,134,162,185,211,280,282,427,431,563,651,686,712,747,762,63,72,121,169,186,188,324,341,542,562,576,586,594,623,764,21,65,117,175,297,309,343,350,370,394,403,483,543,570,588,595,630,643,701,708,717,4,29,32,139,281,292,305,364,393,464,481,484,505,547,564,644,698,727,84,278,600,684,25,126,213,214,249,277,349,636,665,690,752,757,68,333,426,432,545,566,114,120,334,417,448,587,604,13,255,306,357,485,707,170,271,423,496,514,666,760,6,27,137,141,164,206,252,276,283,534,625,736,741,140,168,217,377,420,424,656,159,254,268,327,329,408,546,654,759,20,70,118,131,246,263,391,395,414,153,354,438,541,551,597,676,144,148,267,326,617,165,250,303,352,374,409,558,572,680,138,304,390,429,488,652,679,19,167,226,264,298,552,645,653,671,718,40,247,338,346,489,682,753,262,362,436,487,669,758,91,132,285,337,389,661,28,152,289,296,315,382,442,738,119,147,172,230,293,307,332,342,367,380,383,398,406,412,11,90,123,257,295,670,751,3,151,232,320,360,366,421,571,150,156,233,319,371,387,392,284,291,299,323,358,369,411,157,317,345,379,419,677,746,135,301,310,434,553,638,646,674,258,272,26,133,378,433,749,136,149,163,410,415,648,772,64,428,311,361,418,696,158,318,321,678,124,294,302,336,368,122,273,308,416,761,773,125,265,269,365,130,146,288,381,385,397,344,384,430,145,256,413,1,173,359,351,763,260,287,261,372,373,266,316,290,322,388,376,300,375,312,386],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The text emphasizes the importance of keeping the keyless remote away from these sources of interference to maintain optimal signal strength and reliable vehicle operation.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,184,199,450,451,180,190,721,183,452,454,719,178,201,171,38,192,179,769,196,177,182,239,198,687,175,193,455,174,453,697,200,396,181,143,356,634,503,363,727,404,439,43,628,401,424,142,194,205,399,772,422,514,768,9,23,237,537,195,601,618,602,605,770,238,263,394,445,460,462,549,568,311,457,633,685,71,236,499,529,710,744,75,209,241,251,339,523,526,567,600,607,732,37,39,76,297,313,374,444,465,491,500,528,530,531,598,603,622,639,695,725,731,106,116,129,162,342,432,446,478,651,3,207,223,242,309,402,407,472,519,536,548,599,756,2,62,77,220,250,253,427,521,578,589,608,641,681,686,689,713,22,46,197,210,281,306,425,476,493,524,612,656,742,745,764,7,208,222,240,270,355,360,468,513,532,574,606,613,728,735,766,771,29,47,52,56,74,89,286,330,364,400,414,520,525,590,611,620,675,691,706,726,45,48,68,113,212,262,276,352,354,458,470,498,501,507,512,683,729,42,60,66,72,203,346,350,435,463,490,492,515,587,665,694,716,723,765,54,65,88,98,221,259,348,412,466,555,586,614,640,660,688,722,36,59,204,243,246,249,275,277,325,340,406,440,594,595,629,663,720,740,33,49,50,51,58,166,254,341,405,480,539,540,544,579,636,655,662,666,692,714,733,31,57,104,141,317,334,344,349,362,417,436,441,494,585,593,610,627,754,5,8,61,97,100,101,111,188,244,274,336,357,418,535,560,626,699,11,34,35,63,80,81,92,93,102,115,189,191,202,213,215,218,235,282,345,351,474,516,517,522,631,650,690,753,99,105,108,245,280,337,338,367,403,423,447,504,559,730,69,73,95,103,147,155,187,257,258,271,332,333,343,416,420,426,431,433,437,438,459,461,511,534,561,565,596,724,743,758,767,26,256,361,398,550,581,592,609,623,625,635,637,711,21,25,30,82,387,430,443,477,527,664,693,32,225,314,377,428,508,518,556,667,86,96,145,211,285,320,321,464,538,734,14,125,273,283,365,408,471,569,704,715,755,759,83,206,409,421,547,588,702,739,15,67,78,112,123,127,224,411,543,545,619,53,107,310,456,615,680,705,18,134,227,229,307,347,415,429,533,564,573,647,128,216,248,331,371,410,413,576,616,709,747,159,278,295,475,575,584,649,44,79,137,255,279,632,679,335,382,434,467,469,643,677,707,757,16,154,370,380,381,558,186,214,294,366,368,473,510,644,673,703,717,737,109,157,217,292,392,419,479,485,580,604,668,736,4,247,316,324,393,448,566,748,10,27,94,135,167,353,488,583,597,110,160,161,305,509,542,773,17,87,117,298,304,551,557,642,657,762,231,272,328,506,684,12,119,164,252,481,570,138,288,293,326,487,502,630,652,674,41,131,132,168,301,329,358,373,140,266,299,319,378,483,496,554,563,582,760,126,153,264,269,289,296,379,384,391,497,149,226,359,449,659,669,741,6,139,233,234,383,624,712,120,185,390,148,267,284,486,621,750,303,327,591,708,28,85,505,701,24,219,369,553,700,156,232,287,291,318,676,55,118,133,136,150,312,315,386,752,114,122,385,388,389,484,670,121,169,395,482,84,90,322,572,577,19,20,268,302,323,397,617,144,228,495,638,672,682,761,146,151,230,489,546,648,13,40,124,265,571,170,172,442,552,671,165,541,70,152,260,308,696,698,738,372,261,678,718,751,646,658,91,746,376,653,130,290,173,749,1,300,562,645,654,64,763,163,375,661,158],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What is the primary purpose of the \"Door Unlock Mode\" feature in the Keyless Access Setup, and how might changing its setting affect the user's experience when approaching their vehicle?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[394],"raw_output":"","pred":"The primary purpose of the \"Door Unlock Mode\" feature in the Keyless Access Setup is to determine which doors unlock when the driver grabs the driver's door handle. This feature allows the user to customize the door unlocking behavior to either unlock only the driver's door or unlock all doors simultaneously.\n\nChanging the setting of the \"Door Unlock Mode\" can significantly affect the user's experience when approaching their vehicle. If the setting is changed to \"All Doors,\" the driver will need to grab the driver's door handle to unlock all doors, which might be more convenient for users who prefer to unlock all doors at once. This could enhance the efficiency of entering the vehicle, especially if the driver has multiple passengers or items to carry.\n\nOn the other hand, if the setting is kept as \"Driver Door Only,\" the driver will only need to grab the driver's door handle to unlock the driver's door. This might be more convenient for solo drivers who only need to enter the vehicle. However, it could be less convenient for passengers who need to access the rear seats, as they would have to wait for the driver to unlock the doors.\n\nOverall, adjusting this setting allows for personalization based on the user's specific needs and preferences, improving the overall convenience and efficiency of accessing the vehicle.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[394,142,181,182,178,186,396,143,188,388,304,766,205,261,183,227,129,179,193,177,259,509,175,196,764,214,162,392,453,174,200,387,286,577,180,197,288,460,489,545,631,176,540,541,573,584,147,171,531,594,14,136,169,222,278,323,452,457,502,530,556,611,634,138,199,314,496,558,600,38,45,150,305,343,377,379,395,454,459,470,481,491,563,564,583,739,145,160,285,405,424,492,505,520,574,575,606,629,21,298,380,393,461,490,495,543,189,201,282,320,383,412,445,462,485,516,542,576,593,596,619,623,30,139,140,217,313,378,487,544,557,571,578,580,110,115,144,184,198,276,390,432,458,488,515,527,560,561,590,630,723,106,116,190,204,341,406,410,450,513,570,586,603,614,616,768,206,274,350,427,439,486,497,549,555,582,589,591,598,612,118,127,172,382,425,431,465,476,483,510,518,522,533,538,562,769,93,159,185,192,249,398,408,475,524,548,551,552,602,624,37,88,141,213,241,321,340,352,391,455,469,493,553,554,567,579,581,592,617,620,114,168,187,239,289,290,338,346,363,404,463,468,501,534,610,613,622,627,651,120,137,151,194,209,216,275,293,299,397,500,506,511,512,517,559,625,644,652,690,721,740,743,23,73,170,173,211,235,243,303,332,348,389,441,478,479,484,521,525,536,565,599,609,621,626,736,744,97,203,207,210,240,280,315,329,331,333,464,471,507,528,546,601,604,628,772,12,27,34,48,123,191,281,284,334,356,384,385,435,447,451,456,466,477,508,526,529,539,550,587,608,615,618,702,706,32,152,251,271,292,307,417,434,436,440,443,449,472,474,480,482,503,605,632,635,645,716,745,195,212,242,309,312,319,327,407,494,498,499,523,643,756,767,9,20,29,49,58,92,126,247,258,295,318,418,421,519,532,537,547,566,637,673,674,710,17,125,148,154,236,254,270,301,325,326,381,420,438,467,535,585,722,8,244,252,262,360,473,568,569,607,718,132,155,228,263,273,283,310,322,330,400,504,588,686,695,33,47,157,245,253,260,317,337,386,399,414,444,446,448,595,711,2,3,5,22,65,71,102,104,119,246,429,597,699,742,765,153,208,215,234,409,514,704,727,112,238,255,306,311,349,403,419,422,423,688,697,713,726,770,26,67,94,105,133,149,264,266,291,324,344,345,354,426,633,665,668,672,748,771,15,31,76,135,411,433,655,676,708,719,24,25,98,117,146,156,231,257,267,287,402,636,646,649,660,53,131,218,269,294,335,351,416,572,691,694,731,69,83,108,122,272,316,353,374,700,724,725,6,72,85,89,99,113,128,161,202,297,358,413,415,693,728,735,52,56,158,342,361,437,641,647,683,712,720,729,77,109,121,164,166,223,250,256,277,279,328,362,430,715,50,124,226,229,265,685,689,732,754,19,61,111,220,221,237,268,336,640,705,750,36,54,64,82,101,296,347,355,658,675,682,730,733,28,51,63,219,230,300,339,656,707,16,43,96,165,357,648,662,664,698,4,44,46,60,68,74,95,107,248,428,650,687,734,738,753,11,59,66,370,701,714,717,39,42,57,75,130,232,657,681,10,79,134,167,224,233,302,364,371,401,667,55,62,70,100,679,680,757,758,759,773,87,225,639,642,684,18,35,80,308,367,13,84,163,372,659,663,666,678,709,78,103,677,741,41,661,762,91,703,752,365,692,359,669,86,366,7,81,368,369,737,751,760,755,761,671,749,376,747,670,40,90,654,763,1,375,638,653,373,442,696,746],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"How can you adjust the print settings to ensure that a document with a pie chart is printed in a smaller size on one sheet and in a larger size on another sheet, while maintaining the layout and proportions of the original document?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[48],"raw_output":"","pred":"To print a document with a pie chart in a smaller size on one sheet and in a larger size on another sheet while maintaining layout and proportions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Select the Multi-Page Setting**: On the printer driver's Main tab, choose the Multi-Page setting. For the smaller print, select \"1x1 Poster\" or \"2x1 Poster\" (if available). For the larger print, select \"2x2 Poster\" or \"3x3 Poster\" (if available).\n\n2. **Adjust the Print Density**: Go to the More Options tab and select \"User Defined\" under Print Density. This allows you to manually adjust the print density to ensure that the pie chart fits the desired size without bleeding through to the reverse side.\n\n3. **Set the Paper Size**: Ensure that the paper size is set appropriately for each print job. For the smaller print, use a smaller paper size, and for the larger print, use a larger paper size.\n\n4. **Layout and Orientation**: Adjust the layout and orientation settings as needed to fit the pie chart within the chosen paper size. Ensure that the layout maintains the original proportions of the pie chart.\n\n5. **Print Density Adjustment**: Experiment with different print densities to find the optimal setting that fits the pie chart within the specified paper size without compromising the clarity and readability of the chart.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively print the document with a pie chart in both smaller and larger sizes while preserving the layout and proportions of the original document.","source":"data/test/workforce_pro_wf4830_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[68,284,50,76,40,75,48,64,46,47,65,41,67,87,69,58,212,55,117,38,49,66,56,214,60,85,211,44,57,39,219,111,223,123,86,52,54,210,314,27,124,45,81,277,63,74,82,220,121,209,118,225,53,70,205,213,311,42,181,218,276,28,216,8,154,285,291,37,149,51,83,84,162,202,208,200,224,228,2,29,259,59,91,148,94,108,120,147,315,341,122,260,350,43,130,329,73,203,263,22,100,283,23,112,222,26,61,77,97,106,221,227,261,298,72,229,249,32,71,93,199,238,316,328,6,35,204,215,248,267,290,322,323,18,266,286,339,3,62,178,333,80,99,256,270,289,310,325,358,362,194,279,331,353,24,98,166,183,288,312,334,337,342,354,30,110,116,179,262,281,330,336,1,78,90,92,109,127,133,165,193,217,321,324,344,4,5,157,159,195,245,287,355,190,268,278,292,313,326,96,115,128,145,152,197,332,335,338,351,359,105,129,132,172,206,244,343,352,363,36,198,226,241,327,182,345,14,21,33,95,177,207,305,317,340,348,367,131,237,240,251,275,114,119,253,257,365,15,20,34,101,142,155,185,196,201,231,252,293,349,366,12,138,176,233,250,271,274,282,309,347,381,156,169,184,247,346,370,380,126,186,230,258,299,300,139,163,235,239,265,360,368,372,25,31,125,135,137,160,168,180,269,371,376,7,17,146,255,318,13,151,189,356,79,89,102,191,296,301,136,173,272,280,319,382,104,141,153,254,307,164,187,234,242,246,16,144,297,308,320,357,364,375,88,134,243,273,304,361,374,143,161,306,378,107,150,167,170,192,383,174,175,188,373,140,158,113,171,232,236,264,377,11,103,303,295,369,379,10,19,294,302,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

{"question":"What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using the \"Continuous\" file numbering method compared to the \"Auto reset\" and \"Manual reset\" methods when managing large volumes of images across multiple memory cards and folders?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[186],"raw_output":"","pred":"The \"Continuous\" file numbering method offers several advantages when managing large volumes of images across multiple memory cards and folders:\n\n1. **Sequential Continuity**: Images are numbered sequentially, ensuring a logical progression from one image to the next. This is particularly useful for maintaining a consistent order in image collections.\n\n2. **Ease of Organization**: It simplifies the organization of images, as each new image is assigned a number that follows the previous one, making it easier to track and manage the image flow.\n\n3. **Consistency Across Cards**: Even after replacing a card or creating a new folder, the numbering continues uninterrupted, which is beneficial for maintaining a cohesive workflow.\n\nHowever, there are also potential disadvantages:\n\n1. **File Number Overlap**: If the replacement card or existing folder already contains images recorded previously, the new images may continue from the existing numbering, potentially leading to file number overlap. This can be problematic for maintaining unique file names.\n\n2. **Data Management Complexity**: While useful for sequential organization, it may become cumbersome to manage if the numbering system becomes too complex or if there are frequent changes in card or folder usage.\n\nThe \"Auto reset\" method, on the other hand, restarts the numbering from 0001 each time a card is replaced or a new folder is created, which simplifies data management but may not be as useful for maintaining sequential continuity.\n\nThe \"Manual reset\" method allows for more control over the numbering process, enabling users to reset the numbering to 0001 manually or start a new folder with a fresh numbering system. This provides flexibility but requires more manual intervention, which can be time-consuming.","source":"data/test/eos_4000d.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[186,295,187,278,316,193,52,184,297,318,269,12,181,195,15,17,65,185,288,315,117,290,2,10,285,87,242,317,73,118,252,134,271,171,319,138,180,100,167,230,245,250,273,235,28,248,289,53,101,174,112,202,5,39,261,283,292,66,40,194,277,280,299,38,50,74,154,213,237,279,298,13,88,142,149,166,221,85,96,182,220,259,89,90,145,161,162,165,170,222,249,169,175,286,139,207,268,11,57,61,71,179,198,211,217,253,282,47,158,209,251,8,103,146,173,176,218,246,272,276,284,48,55,60,83,92,99,133,231,239,243,263,287,6,59,79,131,140,212,215,227,16,63,148,155,188,229,264,18,19,24,54,86,121,168,190,226,254,293,41,192,256,296,91,97,128,143,160,214,219,244,281,37,68,111,113,123,191,203,223,225,241,294,30,44,104,163,201,260,313,98,216,228,234,257,258,14,51,70,115,156,196,210,233,265,314,36,64,95,159,164,178,200,247,304,34,130,135,152,183,58,110,147,310,4,62,69,72,75,109,116,172,206,270,275,300,35,42,67,114,122,151,199,208,23,76,189,80,94,127,144,150,224,312,7,9,21,49,129,141,153,157,236,240,20,25,197,262,27,204,320,1,93,124,321,82,45,102,108,177,255,29,132,301,303,126,205,238,77,78,119,307,291,322,106,107,308,137,302,309,3,232,56,136,266,22,43,84,305,81,105,306,120,267,311,46,32,125,274,26,31,33],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The heaviest ingredients (ice and frozen) are loaded last to prevent them from floating to the top and creating a separation issue.\n","source":"data/test/ascent_a3300i.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,7,66,5,25,26,3,103,67,93,55,46,65,56,68,178,48,53,98,63,8,33,35,105,108,146,38,31,154,45,1,95,96,125,145,58,88,141,148,54,86,123,133,4,57,73,127,138,166,151,173,27,43,85,118,155,163,28,101,131,147,23,41,64,121,195,36,51,87,106,142,126,184,17,61,91,153,157,185,14,81,113,168,175,2,62,112,177,13,42,44,52,22,75,84,111,124,165,21,32,117,135,102,107,116,122,137,158,188,11,74,78,115,128,143,152,159,194,83,97,134,136,9,37,77,82,139,162,24,47,69,94,167,176,12,16,34,49,156,15,92,164,182,193,198,79,104,119,144,189,29,179,183,18,132,171,181,39,72,129,197,174,191,114,192,161,186,99,196,199,187,89,59,169,109,71,172,76,19,149,190,200,110,10,30,50,60,90,100,150,40,170,70,130,80,160,120,140,180,20],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What is the maximum number of legal-sized plain paper sheets that can be loaded into the paper output tray, and how does this compare to the capacity for standard plain paper sheets?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[212],"raw_output":"","pred":"The maximum number of legal-sized plain paper sheets that can be loaded into the paper output tray is 10 sheets. This is significantly lower than the capacity for standard plain paper sheets, which is approximately 50 sheets. The difference in capacity is due to the size of the legal-sized paper, which is larger than standard A4 or Letter-sized paper. \n\nStandard plain paper can accommodate more sheets because its dimensions (210 x 297 mm for A4 and 216 x 279 mm for Letter) allow for a larger stack without causing jams or misfeeds. Legal-sized paper (216 x 356 mm) requires more space and can lead to increased friction and potential paper jams when loaded in bulk. Therefore, while the paper output tray can handle legal-sized paper, it does so with a reduced capacity to ensure smooth feeding and prevent any operational issues.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[212,153,513,122,456,98,211,509,210,519,400,535,79,517,2,501,121,113,117,510,75,233,280,33,83,514,87,260,4,508,154,173,262,85,229,405,231,469,76,203,205,256,408,275,93,465,218,225,281,533,82,458,502,518,78,226,406,223,286,89,198,222,235,484,221,228,285,105,209,261,263,80,467,534,81,86,245,410,174,219,220,267,77,208,507,3,252,398,463,97,237,74,129,227,271,234,239,250,325,389,466,283,324,176,461,95,253,531,189,213,323,411,183,295,92,224,240,392,468,90,204,264,359,451,5,120,247,255,382,378,522,94,102,215,251,254,532,123,454,511,8,399,9,265,266,321,521,314,515,236,270,308,416,457,464,472,88,230,284,145,147,148,197,214,372,415,506,520,96,106,185,294,375,99,315,450,101,430,536,84,137,169,379,432,258,357,512,144,206,293,377,481,91,149,351,374,488,7,125,158,168,296,471,516,268,300,384,452,34,246,346,480,35,108,320,352,407,542,119,127,175,186,390,42,100,150,172,269,273,470,25,157,192,282,303,459,504,112,347,354,424,439,473,529,538,10,27,151,232,302,61,156,194,257,292,373,6,289,449,530,38,107,309,349,478,483,36,104,135,160,259,386,436,437,55,316,429,460,17,187,200,14,65,448,114,244,291,362,383,19,110,341,248,16,56,68,181,523,32,37,73,306,370,526,528,139,438,23,39,70,272,401,446,116,162,242,287,307,363,442,28,44,62,159,188,274,342,539,30,31,40,191,290,299,317,20,297,312,343,525,537,18,141,184,15,118,318,330,397,462,494,24,131,217,360,46,171,387,447,503,67,412,455,493,524,21,22,138,195,353,403,26,497,45,111,170,180,278,279,344,395,193,319,402,440,476,541,52,199,298,332,333,12,143,310,340,366,58,109,238,326,331,348,350,165,190,313,428,29,64,103,132,146,161,496,49,140,179,277,369,51,57,367,368,385,409,426,477,482,41,115,311,418,53,72,124,130,152,336,380,394,489,126,419,444,490,540,43,63,134,329,364,479,128,339,433,66,388,47,133,288,322,396,431,498,166,182,201,334,505,13,249,337,423,48,164,177,304,391,434,1,11,136,422,196,356,365,371,167,216,417,500,54,361,71,155,163,441,243,327,335,276,393,413,202,305,435,50,59,142,345,358,355,495,474,69,376,443,486,178,60,301,338,453,207,414,420,499,527,381,328,475,491,445,425,487,241,485,421,427,492,404],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This can be achieved by using a single type of paper or adjusting the paper weight setting on the printer.\n2. **Manual Scanning**: If possible, scan documents individually to avoid misfeeding and jams.\n3. **Regular Maintenance**: Clean the ADF rollers and guides regularly to prevent paper jams and ensure smooth document feeding.\n4. **Use the Platen**: For documents that cannot be scanned uniformly, consider using the platen scanner instead of the ADF.

This will disable the function that detects the level of ink remaining in the ink cartridge.\n   - Continue printing or copying. However, please note that image quality may be diminished if you print or copy when there is little ink remaining in the cartridge(s).\n\n2. **Open the Printer Cover and Replace the Ink Cartridge:**\n   - Open the printer cover.\n   - Replace each ink cartridge identified by the printer as being empty with a new, genuine Canon ink cartridge.\n   - Close the printer cover.\n\nCanon recommends using new, genuine Canon ink cartridges for optimal image quality.

If it is red or blinking white, the camera is unable to focus. Adjust the focus manually or try increasing the distance to the subject.\n\n5. **Use the AF-Assist Illuminator**: If available, use the AF-assist illuminator to assist the focus operation. However, be cautious not to shine it directly into the subject’s eyes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the focus and exposure remain locked when you press the shutter button halfway, even if the initial focus attempt fails.","source":"data/test/x100vi.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[82,176,324,125,106,395,188,59,186,102,126,98,184,228,131,135,181,392,99,177,73,90,136,312,398,397,100,191,305,325,39,133,404,123,129,190,198,194,309,144,193,364,35,128,396,108,230,107,130,368,80,142,88,127,172,326,53,66,81,96,132,393,334,67,105,111,117,156,183,77,92,97,114,138,178,408,15,38,103,121,134,196,226,281,399,139,262,268,344,36,113,192,227,401,75,89,174,279,302,321,360,58,197,214,403,65,120,162,195,253,333,30,47,76,157,158,180,343,365,112,115,258,331,110,299,362,11,13,40,43,231,269,300,155,173,270,361,406,5,33,74,84,109,310,323,349,359,18,86,118,225,241,261,287,24,45,72,83,104,171,187,275,316,351,14,17,62,68,179,244,332,54,93,140,143,170,189,199,204,274,306,352,382,391,32,70,202,276,296,327,353,402,7,64,119,203,356,363,31,69,85,116,185,283,289,339,358,369,380,400,412,413,9,57,224,373,60,91,164,182,239,254,277,290,381,42,124,34,52,122,137,147,255,20,200,210,250,291,294,303,367,229,272,282,288,347,383,388,405,21,101,273,328,372,292,313,330,16,94,175,240,246,278,390,23,51,149,163,248,260,285,298,311,350,407,37,212,243,245,314,236,259,266,280,338,394,22,165,304,345,348,95,295,307,341,357,409,12,48,161,167,232,346,201,315,27,215,284,376,385,25,154,257,2,8,141,319,389,3,6,55,208,335,377,411,415,41,159,166,205,263,354,50,56,206,217,220,221,366,375,386,4,71,146,256,342,169,219,234,247,252,267,336,374,384,19,151,49,242,320,322,145,207,216,249,340,222,286,293,10,28,378,379,153,168,251,44,61,218,235,209,271,318,46,308,416,160,223,317,211,329,387,301,233,337,1,148,150,238,26,87,63,355,29,213,418,297,410,420,265,417,414,78,419,79,152,264,370,371,237],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The tray itself should be inserted into the phone with the label side facing outward, ensuring that the cards are securely seated within the designated slots.\n\nImmediately after inserting the tray back into the phone, the next step is to format the SD card if it has been inserted. This is crucial to ensure that the card is properly recognized and can be used effectively. Formatting the card will erase all data on it, so it's important to back up any important data before proceeding. Once the formatting is complete, the phone will recognize the SD card and you can begin using it for storage or other purposes. \n\nAdditionally, if you inserted a SIM card, you might need to activate or resize it, which typically involves contacting your carrier.

Simultaneous communication: Unlike traditional text messaging, which requires both parties to send messages sequentially, RTT allows both parties to type and read messages simultaneously during a call. This real-time exchange of text makes it more like a voice call, enabling immediate back-and-forth communication.\n\n2. Call minutes: RTT uses call minutes, just like a regular voice call, whereas traditional text messaging does not consume call time.\n\n3. No additional accessories: RTT doesn't require any special accessories, making it more convenient and accessible for users.\n\n4. Visibility of messages: The text entered by one party is immediately visible to the other party as they type, allowing for immediate feedback and interaction.\n\n5. Keypad and speaker options: During a call, users can access a keypad, turn on the speaker, or add a call, providing more control and flexibility compared to traditional text messaging.\n\nThese differences make RTT particularly useful for scenarios where immediate, simultaneous communication is needed during a call, such as emergency services or technical support.","source":"data/test/moto_g_play.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[235,80,106,132,145,5,133,136,4,134,140,299,100,142,37,104,173,141,143,137,236,278,144,148,276,205,147,211,46,146,290,135,279,209,99,314,295,268,293,298,81,126,296,8,149,107,139,233,175,57,150,234,60,138,151,166,199,228,292,84,176,179,184,20,24,103,161,237,187,260,102,181,101,131,162,83,232,30,65,33,275,50,74,76,97,22,58,130,294,23,85,105,128,204,216,3,6,39,178,188,170,28,154,156,157,108,203,127,165,283,320,121,212,226,301,313,59,77,89,114,169,177,210,64,69,155,189,230,35,289,92,215,231,266,305,55,73,171,291,14,44,164,185,207,315,82,94,214,222,72,158,193,225,312,15,29,38,54,129,220,68,163,191,194,267,319,66,242,246,259,16,95,125,218,197,240,287,19,36,116,123,113,153,201,224,308,53,117,119,253,323,2,34,51,91,186,264,45,63,152,182,239,241,265,43,172,272,61,87,160,244,47,124,196,200,202,219,227,263,284,288,21,52,56,168,195,261,322,31,49,109,120,247,285,317,75,88,111,206,248,67,110,221,274,318,7,13,18,41,79,115,269,282,316,11,26,40,71,86,208,277,286,303,10,118,307,42,62,70,78,300,9,198,229,251,321,17,112,174,180,254,310,12,96,245,159,32,90,250,255,256,257,270,273,297,311,249,252,271,304,27,183,217,258,302,223,262,25,122,192,213,280,281,306,48,309,93,190,98,167,1,243,238],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

A higher resolution, such as 5184 x 3888 pixels, allows for larger prints without degrading the photo quality. This is because the camera captures more detail, resulting in sharper and clearer images when printed. Conversely, a lower resolution, like 640 x 480 pixels, reduces the detail, making the image appear coarser when printed, but it allows for more images to be stored on the memory card.\n\nA photographer might choose a lower resolution setting for several reasons. Firstly, they might be concerned about the storage capacity of their memory card. By using a lower resolution, they can fit more images onto the card, which is particularly useful when traveling or during events where space is limited. Secondly, if the primary use of the images is for web or digital sharing rather than printing, a lower resolution might be sufficient. Lastly, a lower resolution can improve the camera's performance, especially in low-light conditions, by reducing the time needed for processing and saving images.

However, the driver's primary responsibility remains to monitor the surroundings and ensure safety.\n\nFollowing the instructions displayed ensures that the driver is aware of the system's actions and can take appropriate measures if the PDA's assistance is not sufficient. This could involve adjusting the vehicle's speed, applying the brakes gently, or taking evasive maneuvers if necessary. Ignoring the instructions could lead to a failure to respond to the system's alerts, potentially resulting in a collision or other dangerous situations.

This system is designed to override the accelerator pedal input when the brake pedal is pressed, ensuring that the vehicle comes to a safe stop without unintended acceleration.\n\nWhen activated, the Brake Override System may affect the driver's experience in a few ways:\n\n1. It may cause the vehicle to feel less responsive to the accelerator pedal, as the system prioritizes stopping over accelerating.\n\n2. The driver may notice a slight delay in the vehicle's response to the accelerator when the brake pedal is pressed, as the system needs to override the pedal input.\n\n \n\n3. It could potentially lead to a more sudden deceleration if the driver is not expecting it, especially if they are in a situation requiring precise control.\n\n4. The system may activate more frequently in certain driving conditions, such as when braking heavily while the engine is already running at high speeds.\n\n5. It provides an extra layer of safety by preventing sudden acceleration that could be dangerous in situations like heavy braking or emergency stops.\n\nOverall, while it may slightly alter the driving feel, the Brake Override System is intended to enhance safety by preventing unintended acceleration during braking.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[180,479,581,580,217,184,79,216,502,311,354,214,342,477,192,241,288,309,245,301,266,486,296,346,484,77,78,307,356,273,571,578,38,181,353,3,268,341,359,471,177,215,339,494,340,357,355,492,235,263,324,344,347,567,570,276,485,487,271,361,365,569,22,283,338,209,308,7,137,246,267,299,304,445,495,501,185,257,490,527,579,4,183,259,446,572,213,222,248,249,275,165,200,205,208,350,16,219,220,250,252,282,298,303,316,358,428,236,280,318,345,491,576,204,274,310,312,325,348,116,182,191,195,260,277,328,349,515,548,469,493,27,127,134,203,242,258,272,331,336,337,343,371,507,543,573,592,89,130,194,207,278,289,300,432,464,2,10,46,90,129,133,333,370,476,483,506,510,74,87,94,178,193,313,422,73,132,179,186,232,234,262,323,332,441,478,546,68,119,211,247,319,430,473,503,562,218,221,240,256,321,351,420,542,547,563,70,155,253,281,317,326,41,61,95,139,198,251,265,290,305,363,375,421,544,91,118,128,166,168,254,284,285,287,302,334,335,429,440,447,456,497,552,566,590,111,136,223,297,314,577,6,30,56,60,72,105,117,125,199,202,233,243,292,294,369,451,574,12,57,101,126,131,142,210,229,293,315,352,373,374,392,452,482,545,575,92,98,110,201,322,403,509,1,69,82,93,103,123,138,279,291,306,320,330,360,404,438,439,449,453,458,475,480,489,40,45,122,140,151,158,170,244,255,368,372,405,472,504,523,549,551,102,149,156,163,176,226,327,378,481,550,33,49,65,71,96,164,169,174,230,239,329,381,402,457,462,531,8,14,44,52,76,100,135,153,172,380,382,408,426,450,536,564,591,21,115,152,171,383,436,474,512,561,47,48,51,59,86,109,196,206,269,286,385,391,397,406,427,460,513,19,36,97,112,121,124,159,162,270,412,431,522,538,55,106,120,188,225,261,470,526,532,80,81,264,362,364,514,9,104,114,411,560,589,20,32,42,43,99,161,175,238,377,212,387,433,468,541,582,584,11,25,50,228,367,444,454,508,540,596,35,83,295,379,401,467,511,594,85,150,366,376,400,409,415,419,448,37,67,173,231,384,395,424,5,18,31,58,84,160,463,520,197,237,398,399,435,559,593,598,62,141,190,227,407,443,535,28,29,63,64,167,388,521,583,587,15,154,413,437,461,539,556,66,386,390,416,496,500,517,537,39,144,148,224,423,459,524,558,53,189,505,519,534,107,113,145,414,498,143,417,425,442,455,88,393,396,530,24,23,389,488,147,13,466,157,553,518,410,418,465,34,533,499,557,595,75,187,108,434,525,586,529,568,555,588,597,528,146,394,565,585,26,54,554,516,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Always check that the parking brake indicator turns off after releasing the brake.\n2. Operate the shift position with the vehicle stopped and the brake pedal depressed.\n3. If the automatic mode doesn't release the parking brake, apply it manually.\n\nThe text also emphasizes that the automatic mode is designed to reduce the risk of forgetting to engage the parking brake, but should not be relied upon exclusively. It's important for drivers to always manually check and apply the parking brake as needed, especially when shifting gears quickly or not firmly depressing the brake pedal.

The top vent is positioned near the back wall, while the bottom vent is closer to the front of the oven.\n\nThe positioning of the oven vents is crucial for proper air circulation and even cooking. The top vent helps release hot air and moisture from the oven cavity, preventing overheating and ensuring consistent temperature distribution. This is particularly important during baking and roasting, as it helps maintain the desired oven temperature and ensures that food cooks evenly.\n\nThe bottom vent plays a similar role, but it also helps in drawing in fresh air to the oven, which can be beneficial for certain cooking techniques like roasting or broiling. Proper air circulation prevents hotspots and ensures that the entire oven cavity heats up uniformly.\n\nAdditionally, the vents help in the self-cleaning process by allowing the heat to escape, which is essential for the cleaning cycle to work effectively. By allowing the heat to dissipate, the vents prevent the oven from overheating and ensure that the cleaning process is efficient and safe.\n\nIn summary, the top and bottom oven vents are strategically placed to facilitate proper air circulation, maintain consistent temperatures, and support the self-cleaning process, all of which are critical for optimal cooking performance.","source":"data/test/ywge745c0fs.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[1,12,3,10,22,4,16,11,17,32,9,33,34,19,5,6,24,31,36,38,2,26,13,14,27,35,30,28,29,7,15,37,25,20,23,21,8,39,18,40],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

Therefore, it is crucial to avoid installing non-factory equipment on the bumper to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the vehicle's safety systems.","source":"data/test/elantra_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[399,405,404,329,400,388,401,324,69,323,425,360,58,395,74,66,406,11,2,454,62,73,415,158,394,473,215,403,51,68,256,450,49,47,463,36,307,423,32,60,216,292,165,341,402,421,164,171,475,499,41,148,220,418,37,48,55,59,124,166,281,306,434,435,490,30,46,72,203,210,274,286,291,460,525,24,42,150,212,229,426,476,498,25,57,64,94,130,224,238,330,44,50,70,122,136,275,295,296,308,311,337,359,464,45,145,204,225,276,358,376,494,52,87,90,149,211,257,268,285,433,500,533,123,172,180,190,213,226,248,288,309,34,162,188,200,214,218,265,300,387,417,458,491,17,22,71,121,144,170,191,273,289,326,375,396,436,451,452,462,483,511,528,61,266,310,383,410,411,445,492,19,21,28,129,154,159,160,246,294,313,318,327,370,495,519,127,168,250,348,379,397,427,453,457,477,63,140,182,209,249,258,267,389,422,456,474,29,35,56,65,86,115,132,152,242,290,325,449,455,478,510,527,38,40,117,189,223,230,235,260,269,409,461,493,14,27,43,67,88,118,119,176,178,251,272,279,316,424,468,529,531,79,89,141,146,192,196,245,262,298,322,398,413,447,479,480,487,497,517,10,39,103,113,126,128,264,328,333,372,391,459,508,92,202,217,231,343,344,386,412,429,465,467,31,83,84,85,120,142,147,197,233,247,287,354,357,385,441,442,472,496,95,106,131,153,193,232,236,252,293,320,366,470,489,513,524,530,4,5,53,91,100,175,183,244,319,342,384,390,407,514,526,532,26,151,169,199,207,208,222,227,254,350,378,485,15,93,101,102,125,143,219,228,259,261,304,305,314,317,321,336,349,419,420,484,486,16,54,104,108,234,302,347,393,446,448,471,18,23,156,184,194,201,221,253,431,167,206,299,356,367,392,438,482,97,110,163,240,243,271,297,96,107,133,155,174,181,186,237,284,301,335,353,355,374,381,481,488,506,112,187,241,263,369,371,377,432,439,82,111,303,338,340,345,368,408,430,437,444,501,509,3,33,78,139,185,364,416,469,20,81,98,99,138,312,352,373,512,507,1,239,362,6,134,135,177,179,346,363,380,77,255,283,515,13,198,523,173,277,365,518,8,105,332,339,351,12,80,116,270,282,414,428,502,522,205,7,361,443,520,76,382,503,75,137,466,157,195,331,516,114,315,334,504,278,9,161,521,280,109,440,505],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Avoid applying the brakes immediately or attempting to pull off the road, as this can lead to loss of vehicle control and potential collision.\n\n2. **Pull Off the Road**: Once the vehicle has slowed to a safe speed, carefully brake and pull off the road. Drive off the road as far as possible to a safe location, ideally on a firm, level ground. Avoid parking in the median area between the two traffic lanes.\n\n3. **Activate the Hazard Lights**: Press the hazard warning flasher button to alert other drivers of your vehicle's condition.\n\n4. **Shift to Park (P)**: Shift the gear to P (Park) to ensure the vehicle remains stationary.\n\n5. **Apply the Parking Brake**: Apply the parking brake to prevent the vehicle from rolling.\n\n6. **Move the Ignition Switch**: Move the ignition switch to the LOCK/OFF position to ensure the vehicle is secure.\n\n7. **Ensure Safety**: Have all passengers get out of the vehicle and move to the side of the vehicle that is away from traffic.\n\n8. **Prepare for Tire Change**: Once the vehicle is safely off the road, prepare to change the tire. This involves removing the wheel lug wrench, jack, jack handle, and spare tire from the vehicle. Block both the front and rear of the tire diagonally opposite to the flat tire to prevent it from rolling.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure both your immediate safety and the proper preparation for changing the tire, which is crucial for handling the situation effectively and safely.","source":"data/test/elantra_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[409,528,180,419,421,407,262,325,417,423,273,422,22,248,462,418,463,224,375,412,272,415,169,295,424,425,474,225,416,427,454,413,48,143,239,310,62,204,426,435,455,472,532,165,171,228,249,389,244,275,297,340,411,459,19,96,129,150,170,254,279,281,326,410,461,242,300,457,465,484,231,274,363,386,488,492,508,36,122,238,247,256,276,302,439,24,206,241,251,322,445,447,483,21,50,83,157,271,374,430,436,85,152,184,190,205,305,442,449,458,464,491,531,37,168,201,220,229,250,450,487,53,148,154,163,208,237,290,352,367,408,451,473,489,527,30,33,38,52,113,164,195,235,257,414,456,486,41,230,368,373,401,437,446,453,32,51,141,151,232,246,303,400,452,27,55,68,136,207,255,345,29,39,86,147,296,306,346,364,372,490,61,73,174,222,223,252,260,265,318,469,533,40,124,155,226,291,311,312,355,358,441,58,74,94,103,123,162,211,259,264,324,332,360,361,366,370,383,387,390,498,31,34,46,87,126,127,258,263,353,362,376,391,420,524,49,60,93,166,214,221,245,301,309,338,351,444,133,146,172,189,202,210,215,286,289,308,319,347,348,495,115,140,253,320,335,343,356,357,365,429,526,2,42,44,47,69,108,137,173,227,266,339,354,384,494,496,518,100,209,236,284,293,294,395,396,398,443,448,460,466,470,511,43,95,128,135,149,175,200,203,331,336,349,17,66,89,102,112,130,144,188,234,243,270,299,304,475,25,45,59,72,131,153,181,194,213,240,261,287,329,431,433,515,26,57,79,84,90,167,179,182,191,196,216,269,314,321,350,403,63,82,145,199,315,327,341,397,499,520,529,159,268,288,316,342,369,377,380,468,485,4,328,337,371,402,497,530,379,388,394,404,434,471,28,91,114,120,178,186,267,283,467,109,121,125,132,160,192,323,344,385,493,15,92,117,158,161,183,334,392,525,8,77,101,118,119,197,198,330,381,64,105,107,139,212,218,298,333,438,16,71,78,317,405,6,81,187,193,233,313,393,476,512,20,35,88,185,478,106,217,5,12,14,67,116,277,278,282,428,440,480,481,500,502,522,99,110,482,10,280,359,503,378,156,432,11,177,292,510,54,479,506,104,307,399,501,70,56,134,382,477,98,142,285,23,1,75,80,138,18,76,219,406,509,97,111,504,7,523,513,517,3,519,176,505,516,514,13,65,507,9,521],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This visual representation helps drivers quickly understand the system's alert or intervention status at a glance, without needing to look at the instrument cluster or infotainment screen.\n\nThe upward-pointing arrow in this context serves as a simple, intuitive indicator of the lane departure assistance system's status, allowing drivers to quickly assess whether the system is actively warning or preventing lane departures.","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[241,234,242,238,291,302,240,230,270,304,274,110,333,232,303,70,253,298,307,246,301,177,178,272,95,261,359,256,262,269,366,411,141,224,286,312,86,247,289,271,313,103,260,364,393,191,263,290,144,251,300,335,386,396,410,259,264,102,142,225,318,13,214,220,275,279,284,296,321,104,158,165,223,276,297,3,213,294,314,434,442,547,245,281,283,320,76,112,131,244,258,273,306,325,424,485,7,113,243,266,268,308,461,85,212,250,252,323,514,539,542,78,114,166,249,267,282,315,332,438,537,63,77,96,129,194,228,229,236,254,257,285,287,215,218,237,280,299,305,38,82,105,143,187,216,231,248,277,288,535,99,201,227,265,317,507,32,100,150,190,198,199,217,235,420,544,42,189,219,222,226,255,293,295,311,543,66,211,221,239,316,324,369,449,564,34,88,203,310,322,402,526,536,64,73,84,93,210,278,339,340,437,546,2,22,109,126,133,309,459,515,37,69,108,111,149,157,173,292,319,338,425,465,524,20,30,57,61,79,91,98,146,208,387,415,422,466,561,26,72,92,185,540,545,25,65,138,154,361,406,419,428,525,527,140,233,349,452,14,18,39,83,197,337,372,462,477,523,55,182,464,475,56,172,204,336,516,115,162,362,17,62,120,344,453,513,533,53,160,163,168,183,327,331,473,517,45,169,184,401,450,481,43,87,107,326,350,405,421,451,15,19,27,145,345,412,470,528,23,46,68,132,371,397,417,432,469,51,67,328,342,29,31,35,49,392,548,181,188,334,413,416,8,206,360,382,403,426,439,10,97,130,148,153,351,430,134,192,346,358,487,538,550,559,40,127,128,195,509,529,41,54,75,94,170,330,384,385,408,1,44,58,174,341,395,444,472,541,59,81,122,394,50,80,167,383,510,6,117,355,374,404,441,474,498,89,348,365,389,418,479,171,433,478,512,52,101,139,179,376,390,391,407,436,458,508,48,137,147,180,202,375,480,554,60,151,193,455,519,552,186,21,36,125,175,209,353,363,476,161,435,440,446,506,532,116,368,399,463,200,388,445,489,4,28,33,74,468,563,381,494,24,205,429,460,534,12,119,123,196,367,370,502,522,16,155,156,207,356,400,457,378,106,414,443,454,496,47,135,136,380,409,518,560,9,347,431,557,373,488,556,152,159,555,562,11,121,329,398,495,553,343,456,423,448,493,497,176,377,558,71,357,486,427,447,521,5,551,511,124,354,503,379,484,352,467,492,530,499,504,500,471,491,490,164,90,501,549,505,483,520,118,482,531],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This ensures the mirror tilts appropriately for both normal driving and reversing situations.","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[146,542,544,144,296,532,297,316,308,28,186,145,299,111,216,38,171,201,453,148,287,161,323,101,158,288,352,423,89,192,206,218,280,43,112,169,252,330,411,528,1,215,303,355,390,391,469,494,170,172,217,238,251,295,105,232,292,327,354,422,427,533,4,73,94,127,151,200,205,224,231,425,467,480,481,14,15,157,285,305,309,362,413,516,53,74,143,150,294,325,2,55,140,175,182,234,302,310,322,387,416,440,445,474,476,208,265,304,307,314,324,337,351,356,378,386,392,396,448,451,457,473,534,47,95,123,130,154,156,173,181,210,329,336,410,419,475,539,560,96,129,134,167,219,230,267,300,306,405,442,543,139,180,220,233,242,256,270,284,326,397,398,463,17,119,195,207,212,279,358,359,399,429,511,5,32,68,69,121,137,193,236,239,240,275,368,374,401,446,509,538,12,85,132,138,153,184,189,198,344,349,402,461,506,515,54,58,60,131,141,183,199,221,222,237,281,369,375,404,441,459,479,526,531,537,30,61,76,125,160,211,243,257,277,383,407,426,438,26,27,75,86,188,244,248,370,389,393,403,412,443,450,454,455,466,493,523,535,541,40,135,168,187,197,255,343,433,436,59,159,165,178,185,290,313,319,320,328,334,347,348,400,431,439,471,3,6,103,149,152,260,293,338,364,381,415,420,472,540,546,547,563,16,62,88,90,120,227,430,437,449,536,562,70,126,136,204,209,235,264,274,278,282,357,360,379,421,465,517,558,45,57,117,272,301,333,382,408,551,33,77,78,116,177,254,263,335,365,395,409,432,468,527,561,128,249,266,268,317,339,340,367,406,417,470,477,478,510,530,39,142,179,194,286,291,315,373,444,462,464,512,513,525,545,35,50,52,84,147,202,225,372,418,434,460,31,133,155,213,259,283,321,345,361,428,553,559,19,29,56,79,104,250,273,276,298,366,447,514,518,519,552,557,65,124,174,228,247,258,269,353,384,388,394,414,550,23,72,113,122,191,229,271,318,342,346,435,452,508,555,18,21,46,164,203,214,223,502,507,522,529,554,7,8,10,91,102,110,163,166,176,289,363,456,489,499,9,82,226,241,332,371,36,106,377,424,548,64,80,190,253,350,556,245,261,262,487,48,87,99,312,385,13,44,71,108,341,83,93,107,11,98,100,109,118,311,498,504,20,41,49,246,376,380,482,505,37,66,92,162,488,97,196,42,501,115,331,520,67,496,25,81,495,503,63,114,492,458,521,524,491,51,490,22,34,483,500,549,24,486,484,497,485,564],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What actions should a driver take when the Traffic Jam Assist function displays a red indicator, and what might be the implications if these actions are not followed?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[282],"raw_output":"","pred":"When the Traffic Jam Assist function displays a red indicator, it signifies that the operation of either or both of the dynamic radar cruise control and Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) has ended. The driver should immediately manually operate the steering wheel to regain control of the vehicle. This action is crucial to ensure the safety of the driver and passengers, as well as to prevent potential accidents.\n\nIf the driver fails to manually operate the steering wheel when the red indicator is displayed, the vehicle may continue to operate without proper control, leading to a loss of steering assistance. This could result in the vehicle deviating from the lane or even colliding with other vehicles or objects on the road. The lack of steering assistance can significantly increase the risk of accidents, especially in situations where the driver's attention is divided or the road conditions are challenging. Therefore, it is imperative for the driver to promptly respond to the red indicator to maintain control and ensure safe driving.","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[282,454,279,262,280,165,213,276,546,3,278,277,515,275,217,233,266,450,438,449,452,170,281,453,234,437,260,441,451,455,407,442,396,465,236,328,411,171,212,289,85,325,327,432,466,481,235,402,436,477,386,148,169,195,479,156,238,248,283,324,326,434,181,221,284,375,409,429,459,28,89,94,179,216,225,271,425,428,448,456,76,111,173,254,285,294,397,447,457,13,172,223,257,299,406,444,445,533,95,180,259,300,347,369,443,65,112,158,183,253,255,310,400,404,494,12,33,127,130,211,291,305,339,399,403,422,440,446,478,526,29,63,64,139,222,295,306,322,381,405,416,424,140,168,318,337,346,389,408,412,30,43,73,137,143,192,215,242,258,355,476,480,525,538,88,96,120,121,144,151,157,175,194,208,210,252,290,313,316,323,340,357,387,390,413,414,433,435,463,473,475,547,199,224,232,272,311,329,338,362,383,401,419,468,38,78,84,152,177,182,186,189,205,214,244,264,301,320,335,345,351,382,394,415,417,426,26,35,42,47,58,101,133,145,155,185,200,206,207,227,239,240,312,370,392,439,460,27,74,79,83,124,273,348,359,398,467,470,513,516,523,53,54,176,330,333,371,388,391,410,469,545,40,49,70,128,134,146,167,193,267,378,461,527,543,561,39,48,102,113,126,149,184,249,360,365,537,6,7,20,32,62,86,105,109,110,125,136,188,201,209,250,261,350,364,379,395,506,528,75,77,237,336,358,366,380,423,462,464,471,514,37,57,69,154,162,373,536,55,82,150,196,228,287,363,368,532,4,31,178,190,191,286,296,317,334,510,50,103,131,138,197,219,265,274,344,354,393,498,559,2,46,99,159,198,230,231,241,243,297,307,427,493,519,534,535,544,44,60,135,161,220,270,288,430,472,499,8,59,104,187,263,302,309,315,319,321,372,522,541,551,56,116,147,160,174,342,349,374,385,509,539,1,9,108,115,141,203,245,251,303,474,529,72,292,293,418,431,517,542,560,10,14,18,68,98,106,142,256,314,508,512,41,52,97,114,122,202,204,308,488,518,550,557,17,66,153,218,298,352,123,132,304,341,420,421,483,497,558,163,229,269,332,511,11,247,343,487,552,554,92,496,15,16,34,45,61,93,129,246,361,540,91,117,226,489,100,356,376,377,36,268,25,166,495,90,119,367,458,504,524,553,564,531,555,107,500,331,353,384,507,562,556,87,490,548,491,492,502,51,19,22,67,71,5,485,81,21,23,503,521,486,482,164,484,501,530,80,505,118,520,563,24,549],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Firstly, the OnStar system is integrated into the vehicle's electrical architecture. Adding any electrical equipment can interfere with this system, potentially causing it to malfunction or fail to operate altogether. This interference can lead to a variety of issues, including reduced communication capabilities, decreased reliability of emergency services, and disruptions to the vehicle's overall safety features.\n\nSecondly, the added electrical equipment may drain the vehicle's 12-volt battery, even when the vehicle is not in operation. This can lead to a discharged battery, affecting the vehicle's ability to start and potentially causing other electrical issues.\n\nAdditionally, the OnStar system may not function as intended if the added equipment is not properly installed or if it is not compatible with the vehicle's electrical system. This can result in a loss of valuable features such as remote vehicle diagnostics, vehicle health monitoring, and other connected services that enhance the user experience.\n\nOverall, these consequences can degrade the vehicle's performance, increase the risk of technical issues, and negatively impact the user's ability to rely on the vehicle's advanced safety and convenience features.","source":"data/test/silverado_ev_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[413,322,408,417,245,412,420,10,409,411,415,423,154,425,391,414,325,69,410,419,173,237,19,242,155,184,105,172,401,100,360,429,101,416,124,183,397,102,207,332,182,252,272,179,197,210,20,274,159,171,321,31,67,187,205,212,236,379,42,54,161,229,260,265,311,326,65,103,185,307,319,333,338,68,70,93,160,198,277,293,296,310,2,53,141,150,157,211,281,405,137,287,295,313,335,352,200,146,168,218,294,306,324,334,407,181,186,233,271,275,312,35,37,66,163,167,225,331,336,374,376,381,422,12,15,16,50,76,104,114,148,153,228,258,269,273,359,427,22,97,99,120,131,156,165,170,280,346,368,418,57,63,94,144,189,190,216,262,9,40,59,135,214,267,399,402,4,6,8,23,108,152,178,243,256,261,354,380,387,132,134,149,169,180,193,247,254,279,323,5,13,24,33,64,118,164,199,223,238,249,289,292,337,367,421,115,133,145,151,166,204,246,320,364,365,377,426,7,44,58,89,106,162,175,191,270,284,288,316,339,342,362,363,378,424,11,129,202,208,253,308,350,369,41,48,91,121,122,123,136,188,302,315,231,250,251,314,403,128,138,177,201,206,213,219,263,264,282,305,309,356,384,406,158,192,291,297,299,351,382,86,92,116,126,143,209,234,239,266,268,383,21,49,60,61,95,98,107,109,117,127,235,290,327,400,30,39,75,110,176,255,345,386,388,390,14,112,147,194,278,298,344,366,18,72,142,174,195,222,224,226,259,276,340,358,385,392,3,119,203,227,248,283,329,370,428,43,111,343,347,389,17,36,47,77,241,330,29,96,113,232,404,34,81,285,304,398,25,46,51,85,130,139,301,372,32,38,221,230,244,257,341,375,52,87,361,196,215,318,349,62,125,286,355,373,82,217,300,353,74,220,317,45,55,328,28,371,26,73,240,303,1,84,71,393,357,88,79,27,140,56,83,395,396,80,78,90,348,394],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat potential safety hazard is described regarding shoulder belts and child restraints, and what specific action is recommended to mitigate this risk?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[81],"raw_output":"","pred":"The target texts describe a potential safety hazard regarding shoulder belts and child restraints, specifically that children can be seriously injured or killed if the shoulder belt is wrapped around their neck. The hazard arises because the shoulder belt locks when pulled all the way out of the retractor, and it cannot be loosened if wrapped around a child's neck.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the text recommends the following specific action:\n\n\"Never allow a child to wear the seat belt shoulder belt under both arms or behind their back. A child can be seriously injured by not wearing the lap-shoulder belt properly. In a crash, the child would not be restrained by the shoulder belt. The child could move too far forward increasing the chance of head and neck injury. The child might also slide under the lap belt. The belt force would then be applied right on the abdomen. That could cause serious or fatal injuries. The shoulder belt should go over the shoulder and across the chest.\"\n\nThis recommendation emphasizes the proper use of the lap-shoulder belt system, ensuring the shoulder portion goes over the shoulder and across the chest, rather than under the arms or behind the back. It also advises against allowing children to wear the belt improperly, which could lead to serious injuries in a crash. By following these guidelines, the risk of injury from improperly worn shoulder belts can be significantly reduced.","source":"data/test/silverado_ev_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[81,71,72,75,42,74,68,76,89,55,69,16,44,82,425,66,73,4,85,87,267,53,60,62,86,421,88,56,77,83,184,57,67,79,113,419,90,40,65,91,29,52,61,388,2,45,59,230,14,78,288,43,54,58,80,51,94,264,84,9,64,186,197,407,422,326,351,424,244,331,363,50,63,305,312,172,376,3,298,338,114,170,180,188,266,268,346,171,185,261,384,226,234,265,189,201,325,357,423,30,124,183,198,287,354,389,187,190,192,232,238,311,372,70,148,235,269,332,362,365,418,136,191,258,260,293,296,349,381,24,48,155,236,252,272,297,310,390,202,225,259,279,364,371,417,427,92,224,317,392,19,262,295,336,368,379,382,383,385,420,21,143,193,214,246,271,359,375,32,181,199,302,318,333,360,374,255,263,289,350,377,18,25,39,105,137,203,212,275,330,335,386,46,47,106,179,200,245,353,397,95,239,292,347,358,378,404,219,290,367,415,229,247,270,306,328,329,20,28,49,280,324,334,380,387,23,93,182,194,237,253,276,308,314,322,352,168,207,208,249,283,286,33,34,126,248,281,291,398,97,209,220,256,299,361,405,123,139,141,146,217,228,294,370,373,273,282,403,406,112,125,205,254,257,341,356,393,399,426,27,108,116,118,233,277,284,304,309,321,369,100,138,175,178,195,301,316,337,343,401,410,428,31,104,129,177,303,320,366,26,96,160,161,169,216,327,355,413,6,115,119,218,231,240,285,10,22,101,134,159,166,215,223,242,391,5,15,37,210,227,274,345,11,13,99,241,307,35,142,163,243,319,344,411,412,8,121,122,300,315,429,36,206,340,402,158,167,348,409,117,156,396,109,339,251,7,98,102,144,147,173,135,222,165,133,400,17,127,128,204,323,12,103,132,107,162,164,221,342,154,1,313,416,152,110,120,157,278,414,145,131,130,196,211,250,151,38,149,111,153,213,176,41,395,140,174,150,394,408],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Navigation assistance: Voice labels can be used to label landmarks, doors, or other important points in a space. This can greatly improve navigation for visually impaired users, especially in unfamiliar environments.\n\n3. Distinguishable objects: For objects of similar shape, voice labels can help distinguish them, which is particularly useful for visually impaired users who may have difficulty differentiating between similar objects.\n\n4. Customization: Users can personalize voice labels to their needs, potentially improving the relevance and utility of the information provided.\n\n5. Contextual information: Voice labels can provide additional context to TalkBack's voice feedback, making it more meaningful and helpful.\n\n \n\nHowever, limitations include:\n\n1. Manual labeling: The process of creating voice labels can be time-consuming and requires user input.\n2. Accuracy: The accuracy of voice labels depends on the user's ability to name objects correctly.\n3. Coverage: Not all objects may be labeled, limiting the extent of assistance.\n\nCombining these features allows for a more comprehensive and personalized accessibility solution, but requires active user engagement to be effective.","source":"data/test/sms921w.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[189,191,190,184,92,167,131,185,186,98,188,195,79,3,94,2,57,58,101,168,208,141,166,50,198,23,70,85,187,93,120,144,178,83,115,123,129,155,193,35,44,46,97,125,80,122,192,216,38,78,103,102,109,149,173,11,12,51,74,84,148,17,95,104,111,112,121,171,174,217,36,82,147,7,9,28,37,64,91,105,128,140,146,209,211,15,20,108,133,153,160,176,180,181,31,55,69,72,119,4,5,77,219,39,177,179,201,213,18,25,53,61,67,89,107,118,132,196,206,210,212,26,68,81,86,114,124,130,136,137,154,169,197,27,60,75,135,203,215,14,30,43,99,134,157,164,54,65,142,150,194,202,47,52,56,63,16,29,33,40,48,62,138,175,24,34,49,66,73,96,106,161,200,205,22,42,88,116,163,165,199,117,139,151,172,59,87,113,152,19,32,41,45,76,110,182,218,156,207,13,71,170,1,127,158,159,183,204,214,126,143,145,100,6,21,162,10,90,8],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What is the difference in functionality between using the AE-L/AF-L button for exposure lock versus focus lock on this camera model?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[385],"raw_output":"","pred":"The AE-L/AF-L button on this camera model serves different functions depending on whether it is used for exposure lock or focus lock.\n\nFor exposure lock, pressing the AE-L/AF-L button will lock the exposure settings. This means that when you press the button, the camera will freeze the current exposure settings (shutter speed, aperture, ISO) so that subsequent shots will have the same exposure. This is useful for situations where you want to maintain consistent exposure across multiple shots, such as when shooting a series of images with the same lighting conditions.\n\nFor focus lock, pressing the AE-L/AF-L button will lock the focus settings. This means the camera will lock onto the current focus point and depth of field, allowing you to recompose the shot without losing focus. This is particularly helpful when you need to focus on a specific subject and then move the camera to a different position to frame the shot differently.\n\nThe key difference is that exposure lock maintains consistent exposure settings, while focus lock maintains consistent focus settings. This allows photographers to quickly switch between adjusting exposure and focus without having to manually reset these settings each time. Both functions are designed to enhance precision and efficiency in photography, especially in manual or semi-manual shooting modes.","source":"data/test/d5600.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[280,265,261,11,417,260,385,156,421,119,367,259,418,120,277,8,177,7,220,332,108,38,111,152,162,296,365,164,179,46,143,163,264,180,282,412,45,73,334,342,396,416,58,148,294,33,78,281,369,32,80,114,263,27,43,109,178,278,419,31,76,110,201,219,364,372,383,146,154,218,249,331,121,258,283,346,368,386,48,54,77,153,157,102,112,142,415,72,402,150,166,185,311,312,57,79,88,129,279,344,373,44,141,255,275,165,172,336,341,343,378,406,47,122,127,128,130,160,192,377,379,387,200,345,16,93,133,147,155,223,293,347,400,191,210,212,246,274,284,291,371,5,211,384,414,37,71,86,95,116,144,272,273,276,330,366,408,12,34,103,117,125,131,158,159,30,91,104,140,193,292,301,309,420,29,67,182,256,303,404,410,28,36,69,190,214,262,290,314,333,375,405,17,75,82,101,126,196,306,335,349,376,51,85,106,135,161,170,248,295,370,98,167,267,304,313,398,399,409,49,60,113,173,203,216,228,245,254,362,382,403,35,118,268,297,307,2,24,41,64,70,137,199,298,300,338,356,14,18,81,123,138,187,337,374,389,395,401,50,68,89,115,151,197,213,289,302,324,325,340,348,174,184,226,288,320,328,422,92,107,136,145,149,195,225,234,244,319,388,411,13,53,87,96,105,169,269,285,317,357,25,56,181,224,227,257,321,392,94,247,252,318,329,361,22,66,326,352,354,65,271,327,99,100,322,351,39,188,189,198,238,270,350,359,97,250,299,42,59,233,253,3,208,217,232,308,315,10,90,205,360,84,266,202,61,62,229,240,286,358,413,9,239,310,74,186,390,63,139,222,20,52,176,215,287,83,171,237,305,391,124,183,251,15,355,380,397,393,231,316,407,4,175,194,40,132,339,207,1,19,168,26,230,394,323,353,206,23,134,209,235,236,204,55,423,6,241,21,221,363,242,243,381,424],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}
{"question":"What is the relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of the lens described in the document, and how does this relationship affect the depth of field and exposure in photography?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[410],"raw_output":"","pred":"The document describes a Type G AF-P DX lens with a focal length range of 18-55 mm and a maximum aperture range of f/3.5-5.6. The relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of this lens is such that as the focal length increases, the maximum aperture decreases. Specifically, for a 18 mm focal length, the maximum aperture is f/3.5, and for a 55 mm focal length, it is f/5.6.\n\nThis relationship affects the depth of field and exposure in several ways. A wider aperture (f/3.5 for 18 mm) allows more light to enter the lens, resulting in a brighter image and a shallower depth of field, where only a small portion of the image is in sharp focus. Conversely, a narrower aperture (f/5.6 for 55 mm) allows less light in, making the image darker but providing a deeper depth of field, where more of the image is in sharp focus.\n\nIn photography, a wider aperture is ideal for portraits to blur the background, while a narrower aperture is better for landscapes to keep the entire scene sharp. This flexibility allows photographers to control the focus and exposure according to their creative vision and the subject matter.","source":"data/test/d5600.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[400,405,410,379,292,340,220,148,75,218,332,264,338,402,401,412,418,122,395,383,336,257,334,406,382,165,259,179,276,294,146,144,331,43,147,151,190,149,150,367,370,414,333,145,143,112,419,8,86,118,377,47,131,7,102,110,120,180,282,129,261,345,346,375,384,385,44,119,403,31,106,154,293,78,85,121,33,113,142,254,265,280,371,420,76,116,132,152,155,81,114,156,11,28,37,58,67,98,398,32,157,387,407,408,199,56,79,90,105,108,153,192,260,263,99,178,341,5,342,348,364,46,168,397,36,45,123,256,275,74,80,109,159,250,277,318,368,396,415,94,96,197,201,16,196,314,344,347,361,378,404,416,38,111,267,337,343,411,103,194,200,335,366,409,115,140,160,211,93,95,130,284,315,399,73,101,135,138,198,417,421,39,48,104,133,245,274,386,57,164,177,273,339,413,423,117,127,258,369,422,50,53,210,317,322,359,128,163,176,187,281,296,312,3,193,195,14,35,82,107,205,306,89,252,319,321,91,217,223,262,272,358,17,92,97,136,158,191,212,249,268,354,77,87,181,204,214,222,290,303,308,309,29,241,255,13,41,124,137,184,186,216,219,248,307,311,313,365,9,172,173,269,30,84,166,167,185,251,253,278,286,125,202,372,6,10,12,62,63,134,139,175,236,362,169,215,230,232,323,324,27,49,141,213,72,203,231,234,289,391,240,171,209,228,287,360,388,126,162,183,208,226,229,247,320,349,363,100,170,174,207,246,283,291,351,23,64,88,161,224,242,244,295,305,356,357,2,34,54,83,225,310,353,373,298,424,21,270,235,59,239,52,206,266,376,389,24,61,352,271,325,279,380,300,182,25,299,238,393,20,55,68,71,288,390,22,1,65,233,237,392,70,316,69,304,227,302,355,51,66,330,381,328,350,4,301,42,40,221,243,297,15,189,19,60,374,327,394,18,326,285,26,329,188],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"Explain how using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator can help minimize energy consumption, ensuring to reference the underlying physics.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[9],"raw_output":"","pred":"Using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator minimizes energy consumption by leveraging the latent heat of fusion.  When frozen food is placed in the refrigerator, it absorbs heat from the surrounding air, causing it to melt. This process requires energy, but it's a more efficient use of energy than running the refrigerator at a higher temperature to thaw the food directly.\n\nThe latent heat of fusion is the energy required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid without changing its temperature.  By using this energy, the refrigerator doesn't need to cool the food to a lower temperature than its freezing point, which would be more energy-intensive.  Essentially, the frozen food \"cools\" itself down as it melts, reducing the overall cooling load on the refrigerator.  This allows the refrigerator to operate more efficiently, using less energy to maintain the desired temperature.\n","source":"data/test/rf59c7_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[9,26,20,55,102,294,181,372,151,347,85,340,156,313,21,103,342,5,182,279,60,122,199,157,198,221,295,371,278,64,66,86,87,116,118,183,280,307,319,115,213,351,360,149,256,290,303,180,249,306,309,194,171,302,373,308,113,146,158,262,339,100,108,128,168,220,314,61,209,311,323,335,350,374,10,79,117,120,144,152,169,226,247,301,353,18,32,98,119,244,268,281,288,349,369,77,84,111,174,193,364,132,214,254,269,289,7,163,190,338,343,53,105,179,16,24,62,73,106,110,112,164,195,277,298,23,52,178,261,282,304,354,368,121,173,175,205,215,259,1,292,310,348,114,137,230,291,19,78,172,208,266,274,296,67,93,324,97,142,267,286,346,359,81,109,123,250,6,82,207,216,276,358,17,22,25,94,125,147,155,161,162,176,299,4,68,101,154,203,219,240,293,297,355,189,202,258,328,332,366,96,223,271,327,367,253,265,285,56,104,196,317,8,107,136,148,160,234,242,83,88,184,197,365,11,14,15,80,210,237,352,300,312,75,170,201,245,275,363,177,257,273,12,59,153,167,200,333,375,99,159,217,218,263,362,235,305,357,63,134,231,255,272,13,57,133,330,370,336,337,246,58,143,270,356,141,252,260,264,316,29,46,145,211,212,251,206,320,334,2,48,72,232,248,331,344,41,222,239,37,65,225,315,50,241,38,51,76,129,139,227,228,318,47,165,40,166,345,192,45,243,321,127,204,74,150,233,36,71,30,329,28,126,130,361,33,43,34,49,325,224,31,238,229,124,138,341,27,326,69,188,380,236,140,191,70,42,284,287,95,135,39,54,3,44,35,376,92,131,322,89,283,185,90,377,91,379,187,378,186],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This button is typically used to activate and adjust cruise control functions in modern vehicles.\n\nCruise control is a feature that allows drivers to maintain a consistent speed without constantly pressing the accelerator pedal. When activated, the vehicle will automatically adjust its speed to keep up with the set speed, even when driving on inclines or declines.\n\nThe cruise control button usually has an indicator light that illuminates when the system is active. Some vehicles may also have a display on the instrument cluster showing the current speed and cruise control status.\n\nTo use cruise control, the driver typically presses the button to activate it, then sets the desired speed using the controls on the steering wheel or center console. The vehicle will then maintain that speed until the driver manually adjusts it or turns off the system.\n\nCruise control can be particularly useful for long highway drives, as it helps reduce driver fatigue by allowing the vehicle to automatically adjust speed within the driver's set range. It can also improve fuel efficiency by maintaining a steady speed rather than constantly accelerating and decelerating.","source":"data/test/zdx_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[182,120,36,168,171,13,83,220,5,84,187,151,226,124,201,239,175,19,21,276,221,241,85,178,207,243,275,35,190,112,41,209,52,119,184,198,267,11,79,240,10,28,34,135,199,272,18,121,15,31,53,160,301,131,340,123,29,134,136,197,347,82,203,139,271,342,154,158,211,236,242,26,80,90,200,213,235,51,269,37,98,114,148,161,164,248,295,6,49,224,225,254,286,289,142,206,260,268,188,296,228,229,231,234,48,223,261,262,70,92,100,144,157,191,343,344,8,47,54,60,159,181,202,288,25,86,117,172,258,16,55,179,204,263,4,7,43,45,149,156,205,246,270,345,346,173,192,218,300,329,338,341,30,94,106,111,113,127,150,185,303,305,17,81,118,126,180,12,20,42,58,152,153,163,195,214,14,24,46,75,107,141,186,210,215,216,73,130,193,249,339,22,88,101,169,174,177,208,217,230,247,299,302,2,56,78,91,162,194,266,277,283,313,40,76,77,87,104,122,133,227,232,237,255,290,298,311,335,44,59,63,102,115,167,238,257,324,9,39,50,57,64,65,72,170,176,189,280,297,334,32,66,110,145,183,233,3,61,62,71,97,125,222,252,259,284,306,315,325,27,96,103,109,264,273,316,319,74,95,105,292,310,108,155,196,219,287,293,304,312,328,33,93,143,212,265,278,330,253,279,291,309,322,331,38,146,165,294,307,67,132,138,89,129,244,333,250,274,314,326,332,308,336,128,337,147,320,69,317,321,99,245,116,140,282,137,281,285,323,1,327,318,349,166,256,23,251,68,348],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Its primary purpose is to dissipate heat generated by the processor and other components within the laptop. \n\nThe heat sink's placement is crucial for effective thermal management. It is positioned directly above the processor, which is the primary heat source in most laptops. By being in close proximity to the processor, the heat sink can efficiently absorb and transfer the heat away from the sensitive components.\n\nThe heat sink's design typically includes fins or a heat-pipe system that increases the surface area for heat dissipation. This allows it to spread the heat over a larger area, enhancing the cooling efficiency. The heat sink is often attached to the processor using thermal paste or paste-like material, which further improves heat transfer.\n\nIn addition to the heat sink, the image shows air vents on the bottom of the laptop. These vents allow cool air to enter the device and help in drawing heat away from the internal components. The combination of the heat sink and air vents creates a closed-loop cooling system that helps maintain optimal operating temperatures for the laptop, preventing overheating and ensuring reliable performance.","source":"data/test/inspiron_16_plus_7630.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[65,66,12,73,9,35,76,11,44,58,75,10,38,67,68,83,61,69,49,79,13,55,63,70,34,48,51,52,42,50,78,82,43,46,41,7,39,45,54,72,15,77,29,71,80,81,84,47,8,62,3,59,22,27,32,64,95,56,94,23,60,2,33,30,57,53,74,40,31,4,16,36,100,1,25,87,17,24,99,21,37,26,96,5,97,101,88,90,98,14,89,18,86,91,92,28,20,19,85,93,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

These failures are characterized by an immediate and complete loss of device functionality. An example of a catastrophic failure is a memory DIMM (Dual In-line Memory Module) that has received a static shock and immediately generates a \"No POST/No Video\" symptom with a beep code emitted for missing or nonfunctional memory. This type of failure is more easily recognizable and can be immediately identified upon occurrence.\n\nIntermittent failures, which represent approximately 80% of ESD-related failures, are more difficult to recognize and troubleshoot. These failures occur when the device receives a static shock, but the damage is not immediately apparent. The weakened trace may take weeks or months to melt, leading to degradation of memory integrity, intermittent memory errors, and other less obvious symptoms. This type of failure is more latent and may not produce outward symptoms related to the damage immediately.\n\nThe intermittent (also known as latent or \"walking wounded\") failure is more challenging to diagnose and troubleshoot because the symptoms are not immediately visible, making it harder to identify the cause of the issue.","source":"data/test/inspiron_16_plus_7630.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[32,31,33,94,29,96,2,3,95,30,98,53,101,26,7,8,97,99,20,90,16,12,5,6,100,23,36,87,19,22,91,27,88,86,92,93,89,24,25,72,1,76,85,43,9,14,28,80,10,13,73,21,60,37,70,77,11,50,18,41,39,17,38,78,15,79,66,82,83,59,71,44,4,34,65,49,75,55,61,62,64,74,52,68,35,54,67,42,46,48,40,84,47,45,57,51,56,58,69,63,81],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

After the power has been disconnected for the required duration, reconnect the power supply and restart the appliance. This process helps in resolving the communication problem between the main and touch components, ensuring that the appliance operates correctly.

The overall system likely provides a comprehensive way for parents to oversee and limit their children's digital experiences across various platforms.","source":"data/test/maxstream_mr5500_series.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[632,46,407,471,535,696,729,143,176,242,439,827,79,340,762,794,274,373,503,111,600,664,13,306,567,210,404,597,207,336,621,435,823,824,76,303,499,758,108,206,238,271,302,467,531,564,436,563,692,693,790,9,107,369,403,532,596,629,660,12,75,270,398,559,599,688,725,826,42,139,172,370,500,720,786,818,167,337,431,631,5,10,201,406,628,37,239,266,372,468,527,591,624,695,726,753,103,140,142,234,305,331,463,558,759,135,175,209,339,365,656,728,495,566,791,45,71,43,362,438,661,699,110,534,761,173,502,78,470,164,241,301,353,298,332,273,663,588,625,667,793,295,351,830,801,2,309,49,418,592,627,760,732,18,179,247,376,395,685,82,328,334,412,506,69,343,410,603,637,765,114,317,510,570,611,6,181,605,701,104,146,277,307,440,538,585,635,799,84,279,311,443,476,560,594,669,734,797,828,213,214,221,245,437,466,474,697,795,16,83,116,122,183,198,371,377,601,40,246,252,299,378,472,659,727,766,767,8,17,36,77,112,147,177,278,345,434,442,539,833,215,249,515,568,700,763,208,217,275,408,413,444,571,730,834,70,74,80,148,243,341,475,481,508,509,540,604,665,138,182,211,374,572,623,718,773,344,409,417,504,507,514,536,562,679,772,792,14,51,204,223,338,364,565,578,610,613,633,698,756,798,832,15,144,200,202,312,363,421,422,687,719,769,796,829,72,411,414,694,819,821,825,4,11,44,115,121,253,320,387,397,399,405,484,533,537,549,556,662,731,733,774,817,47,53,65,86,174,285,304,310,375,380,430,494,513,577,586,636,638,645,703,707,737,785,815,19,89,90,109,125,153,187,281,284,297,313,342,379,461,630,634,689,747,812,102,106,156,190,240,255,272,330,347,366,401,469,516,545,574,580,607,841,23,24,145,354,446,542,548,573,598,639,646,648,650,674,708,710,750,800,838,58,60,149,157,276,346,441,530,642,691,784,134,166,384,432,655,677,706,709,736,764,768,805,68,118,220,237,478,501,526,546,740,752,754,775,843,92,265,269,288,308,350,450,452,547,606,614,641,657,675,739,48,57,141,150,321,415,423,489,505,590,647,64,101,192,216,264,355,420,449,483,486,493,569,666,804,807,813,32,62,94,100,170,193,233,248,445,453,457,460,512,541,557,609,618,673,702,743,744,20,26,27,50,59,117,124,165,178,286,319,383,428,454,462,482,487,492,524,615,643,644,671,676,806,811,52,113,129,287,323,368,426,458,477,602,705,735,28,38,81,85,229,316,325,326,329,429,451,464,480,517,581,584,712,741,780,781,55,56,188,189,280,352,386,390,424,498,704,776,839,30,63,93,222,225,254,425,427,448,511,553,612,680,723,783,808,840,97,258,382,385,576,579,616,742,745,831,35,91,123,154,169,259,283,318,392,473,640,25,87,88,95,127,151,194,388,389,479,544,668,771,789,816,3,31,34,130,180,185,195,226,257,267,455,721,738,748,787,809,844,66,158,162,191,228,393,416,447,485,520,551,582,649,670,686,717,751,126,212,232,244,250,260,289,356,419,518,575,714,779,845,22,120,155,160,186,256,282,290,357,396,543,654,672,711,778,803,98,159,251,296,678,788,846,315,359,360,525,550,619,681,777,802,810,29,224,231,322,456,488,519,682,33,184,324,335,391,552,583,617,837,61,136,261,713,715,842,21,41,96,219,227,291,292,490,608,622,653,722,746,119,132,433,465,497,554,626,683,757,770,836,39,105,128,161,349,400,521,133,218,235,402,152,263,528,589,820,367,595,459,651,358,684,755,196,522,593,658,268,782,73,54,199,203,137,690,168,236,205,7,381,847,262,529,496,652,171,361,314,716,724,491,67,99,293,822,848,300,327,561,620,333,163,230,555,294,394,348,523,814,835,1,587,131,749,197],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target tables in the document:\n\nWhat key piece of information would differentiate between a cloud login and a local login when reporting issues to Linksys, and how might this impact user privacy considerations?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[20],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key piece of information that would differentiate between a cloud login and a local login when reporting issues to Linksys is the \"Login Type\" field. \n\nFor cloud login, the \"Login Type\" would display the user's associated email address. For local login, it would display \"Router admin\". \n\nThis differentiation is important for privacy considerations because it allows Linksys to distinguish between users who are logged in through their cloud-based LinksysSmartWiFi.com portal and those who are using the local router interface. \n\nFor cloud users, Linksys would have access to their email address, which could potentially be used for targeted marketing or other customer engagement efforts. However, for local users, only the router admin name would be visible, providing more anonymity.\n\nThis distinction helps Linksys balance the need for detailed diagnostic information with user privacy concerns. It allows them to gather specific information from cloud users while still protecting the identities of local users who may prefer more private access to their router settings. This approach helps ensure that Linksys can improve the Wi-Fi experience while respecting user preferences for privacy.","source":"data/test/maxstream_mr5500_series.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[118,20,150,561,7,446,542,755,658,39,217,529,690,414,236,400,574,639,703,769,497,736,86,249,333,593,626,105,268,465,510,607,722,137,367,169,300,750,801,234,295,380,322,347,671,257,433,73,820,40,158,559,744,94,159,231,401,463,720,788,34,62,170,203,266,362,466,562,679,789,37,63,204,478,656,753,786,2,100,167,198,328,454,518,756,834,74,495,591,647,711,809,818,53,103,527,680,723,843,5,138,334,356,556,821,183,298,313,365,594,659,685,689,777,71,201,431,582,783,28,126,289,398,434,486,530,550,621,691,323,528,688,712,815,68,135,136,264,269,301,368,487,492,498,551,615,124,164,225,389,422,524,548,624,653,683,754,6,72,95,132,281,290,366,627,192,237,588,592,193,196,226,258,331,361,29,66,190,296,393,420,423,460,560,847,8,299,360,399,519,583,717,745,106,586,645,657,709,775,778,26,54,60,127,396,484,496,613,648,718,781,787,841,38,232,263,287,452,522,625,721,844,92,101,395,516,677,742,162,165,294,326,363,387,429,458,490,748,390,464,715,104,202,320,348,428,525,580,616,619,156,229,555,622,651,784,69,267,461,807,813,133,332,354,98,197,455,493,557,686,810,848,32,168,223,293,357,394,554,261,589,716,835,130,319,654,235,255,426,751,819,587,816,262,327,381,427,612,35,131,199,239,620,184,491,523,564,693,749,782,1,67,99,352,43,432,444,684,33,485,629,155,314,353,579,799,3,57,108,271,459,532,10,329,110,189,337,378,436,483,652,692,84,147,154,172,230,303,566,708,78,163,418,419,467,470,572,757,791,45,125,238,270,351,438,508,531,578,605,663,761,793,51,59,76,123,140,316,370,385,534,547,644,669,759,814,823,840,222,273,388,392,646,725,726,758,773,806,824,838,254,317,468,500,540,549,565,596,661,767,776,826,845,102,286,321,369,384,404,412,643,779,839,122,144,148,206,386,513,539,546,597,700,774,790,832,27,42,50,139,141,157,160,173,207,247,284,288,318,371,449,451,481,514,604,675,676,695,741,805,812,55,61,83,91,116,151,215,279,311,345,411,437,499,628,660,678,733,734,760,792,24,121,153,191,224,256,336,435,515,533,563,571,581,637,673,797,25,44,58,75,90,109,134,146,171,209,272,278,382,403,453,502,512,538,694,732,739,842,107,128,302,391,405,476,558,590,611,642,662,668,701,710,727,743,808,36,64,93,181,187,339,374,526,576,614,707,728,798,9,41,77,81,89,114,241,277,350,469,517,545,610,740,18,23,82,88,142,174,220,240,285,376,482,501,506,599,674,706,765,766,188,260,355,417,430,471,584,598,630,702,713,735,804,831,96,115,175,221,280,342,344,375,489,507,544,567,603,698,719,764,796,245,274,306,308,358,372,441,443,450,474,505,509,569,575,649,699,811,830,11,213,292,377,410,421,439,448,462,473,480,541,577,606,609,665,737,772,15,46,56,79,117,194,252,297,304,309,338,364,373,424,442,475,552,573,636,641,650,697,731,752,802,825,145,182,246,253,259,265,305,310,330,608,617,667,746,800,827,16,30,70,87,166,216,251,315,343,406,409,520,666,687,705,724,829,12,14,208,244,307,397,402,494,504,535,536,631,681,696,833,17,178,214,312,340,415,457,472,570,623,664,785,795,19,48,113,143,179,186,195,200,210,212,227,233,291,341,379,383,407,456,633,638,655,729,768,817,837,31,129,152,479,488,511,601,634,672,771,22,47,49,120,211,275,568,595,618,635,738,763,803,828,52,80,185,250,276,324,346,585,704,730,747,762,794,846,4,112,177,180,219,242,243,325,335,440,503,537,553,600,780,111,119,149,283,447,477,602,836,65,85,161,176,408,416,543,13,21,97,248,282,359,632,228,413,521,640,670,682,349,218,425,770,822,445,714,205],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"In what scenarios should you avoid using HDR mode when taking photos, and why might it be unsuitable for those conditions?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[119],"raw_output":"","pred":"Avoid using HDR mode in the following scenarios:\n\n1. **Action shots**: HDR mode requires the camera to capture multiple exposures, which can introduce motion blur in fast-moving subjects, resulting in blurry photos.\n\n2. **Low-light indoor photos**: HDR mode is designed for high-contrast scenes. In low-light conditions, the camera might struggle to capture enough light for the high dynamic range, leading to noisy or underexposed photos.\n\n3. **When you want to use the flash or the front camera**: HDR mode typically requires the camera to capture multiple frames, which might interfere with flash synchronization or the front camera's functionality. Using the flash or front camera in HDR mode could result in inconsistent exposure or image quality issues.\n\nHDR mode is best suited for scenarios where you want to capture the full range of brightness and contrast in a scene, such as landscapes with bright skies and shaded areas, outdoor portraits with significant contrast, backlit scenes with dark shadows and bright highlights, and when both the camera and subject are stationary. In these conditions, HDR mode can enhance the photo's dynamic range, providing more detail in both the highlights and shadows. However, for fast-moving subjects, low-light environments, or when specific camera functions are required, HDR mode might not yield the desired results and could even degrade the photo quality.","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,153,176,177,252,107,141,58,150,38,116,151,188,67,118,120,217,168,193,212,31,208,207,230,101,114,117,146,189,68,209,239,47,173,163,136,152,204,231,19,60,72,158,159,233,6,34,115,140,144,194,210,223,90,197,238,81,174,185,89,102,106,125,139,169,240,45,46,156,172,39,100,178,190,201,224,225,242,105,126,165,12,192,11,24,62,78,87,103,122,134,138,154,164,56,73,135,147,155,27,95,121,128,160,170,232,22,29,70,74,123,133,145,166,180,205,33,94,142,206,237,243,253,49,51,25,37,162,167,211,227,260,41,55,214,219,246,255,8,50,59,113,235,4,148,175,184,198,137,254,2,76,92,143,257,5,43,129,182,247,256,186,191,48,63,108,124,181,218,93,104,195,42,69,71,85,213,3,18,32,35,86,244,258,23,57,64,161,171,226,236,259,7,202,132,241,249,251,16,65,66,110,179,245,61,75,82,112,149,196,203,44,88,127,157,200,13,21,83,250,215,248,36,91,109,216,52,222,15,79,234,28,80,183,228,40,77,111,99,131,229,17,130,199,96,97,221,9,98,187,20,30,14,53,54,26,220,84,1,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The combination of visual and auditory warnings aims to alert you to the danger and encourage you to take evasive action, such as stopping or reversing, to prevent a rear-end collision.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[424,363,446,333,426,441,442,352,425,427,269,439,332,354,359,115,331,361,391,428,440,443,350,360,390,438,290,330,349,137,335,344,346,351,353,365,366,433,127,200,270,355,431,116,286,289,398,282,362,372,432,540,609,133,314,334,342,345,410,429,430,434,436,437,156,337,347,371,408,422,423,444,496,99,139,142,150,265,280,283,291,324,364,392,402,413,414,417,474,56,57,64,81,104,122,152,190,276,329,376,447,456,472,108,110,112,114,165,166,175,245,259,287,327,367,373,386,388,406,452,508,526,531,107,124,129,132,145,148,176,178,185,275,295,305,325,356,378,385,412,419,445,478,529,155,174,179,182,192,281,316,336,338,348,357,377,382,403,457,491,52,65,135,138,183,186,199,274,277,303,389,396,404,407,411,421,565,23,69,83,93,181,213,218,235,249,260,266,271,284,292,296,302,323,358,397,416,435,451,465,494,506,507,524,538,543,617,30,58,66,80,82,84,85,144,151,153,177,188,219,273,285,297,301,311,328,415,418,420,455,471,490,528,542,41,63,70,73,103,146,230,236,238,240,243,251,253,272,279,293,306,313,318,381,383,463,467,473,541,577,578,586,13,44,46,49,60,95,106,111,128,159,161,184,223,244,252,262,326,370,374,375,468,612,8,35,37,86,87,113,131,147,189,206,222,227,255,264,307,315,454,466,481,523,527,530,546,579,583,585,618,20,31,45,47,67,71,72,79,90,125,130,141,211,232,248,278,343,400,405,453,470,475,522,570,580,39,42,59,89,126,143,162,168,180,187,196,242,246,261,304,310,341,380,393,401,450,469,476,521,571,572,581,608,613,614,616,17,36,88,119,158,233,237,294,312,340,479,486,548,549,38,40,48,61,68,105,220,247,267,368,369,395,477,480,532,547,109,117,191,195,204,229,241,387,394,489,544,553,43,94,123,149,164,208,210,257,339,487,495,560,121,170,228,379,409,567,568,33,54,100,120,203,299,448,552,573,55,97,154,201,226,321,499,539,550,98,118,157,169,171,512,234,300,458,533,563,3,9,74,91,136,197,212,215,587,16,163,172,239,263,615,101,384,483,537,92,167,224,225,449,492,493,569,11,62,308,464,514,18,32,134,193,198,205,216,497,534,554,102,503,559,10,29,288,525,574,576,51,160,221,250,482,498,558,564,600,28,76,268,298,575,231,582,24,50,207,516,557,595,194,214,319,556,21,53,254,500,26,75,209,509,519,596,77,399,460,520,535,584,599,34,322,536,601,78,501,511,518,217,258,202,461,589,502,515,517,566,15,462,2,4,6,25,96,256,320,485,588,598,606,610,620,12,593,603,7,22,459,562,561,590,27,604,619,1,488,545,484,597,140,173,309,5,19,555,317,594,505,605,551,504,592,602,513,591,510,14,611,607],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}
{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof load capacity can lead to several safety risks. Firstly, the vehicle's center of gravity increases, making it more susceptible to rollovers, especially at high speeds or during sudden maneuvers. This can result in severe accidents and injuries. Secondly, the roof rack may become unstable, leading to the collapse of the roof rack structure and potential damage to the vehicle's roof. Additionally, the weight distribution becomes uneven, which can affect the vehicle's handling and stability, making it harder to control, especially on winding roads or slippery surfaces.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to adhere to the specified roof load capacity, which is typically around 100 kg (220 lbs) and should be evenly distributed. Regularly check the roof rack for any signs of wear or damage, and ensure that all cargo is securely fastened. Avoid carrying heavy or large items that exceed the roof rack's capacity. Additionally, drive cautiously, especially on winding roads or in adverse weather conditions, and always use the appropriate gear when driving uphill or downhill to maintain control of the vehicle. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure the safety of yourself and others.","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[249,302,482,39,274,312,546,73,319,31,149,280,311,316,80,310,542,13,131,519,306,492,236,258,483,44,148,303,418,541,42,201,301,309,344,263,454,596,94,315,507,547,49,269,307,395,238,479,66,122,444,43,95,281,130,305,617,74,79,481,129,253,317,513,69,88,268,313,318,10,63,116,203,243,275,285,491,514,45,240,548,67,87,198,357,455,51,65,71,92,292,391,486,509,539,549,85,159,220,244,456,495,538,40,61,93,143,218,252,410,493,72,104,150,156,291,398,489,518,544,563,55,84,105,248,267,314,336,442,24,30,48,83,133,283,290,350,390,452,476,494,545,558,7,11,41,111,125,141,183,211,296,400,425,429,578,32,36,90,151,289,293,393,475,485,614,86,175,192,261,304,590,70,147,242,308,618,52,64,110,246,265,327,337,352,91,102,270,349,412,457,565,35,68,155,204,212,427,446,478,570,585,586,8,123,137,196,297,342,468,506,537,584,17,53,181,227,230,351,355,359,423,571,81,219,341,420,37,108,127,282,472,499,521,572,9,23,234,295,445,461,54,56,103,114,247,260,273,330,335,419,467,616,12,29,33,144,146,262,430,526,28,46,57,135,166,241,255,294,324,326,333,356,358,413,451,470,560,561,58,134,200,228,232,251,325,415,473,474,508,532,533,615,3,107,205,362,428,440,490,59,213,366,424,527,82,142,145,158,233,286,339,367,530,552,564,573,199,371,374,381,414,453,480,577,579,613,76,132,138,161,165,299,361,363,372,543,555,587,157,162,194,237,354,380,465,554,47,75,124,152,195,197,284,360,365,394,435,463,471,575,38,98,189,193,458,528,553,106,128,209,259,264,345,385,417,431,441,466,525,50,185,208,271,343,524,153,154,223,331,397,477,557,569,589,598,16,34,60,89,117,184,215,332,411,551,595,97,113,300,383,396,406,448,531,534,535,550,26,27,160,408,556,112,115,364,416,520,574,62,119,266,272,276,288,402,422,433,503,540,599,109,182,239,254,329,369,469,522,576,188,328,340,386,421,484,529,593,609,78,179,225,277,399,426,121,338,379,392,401,77,177,186,206,278,334,370,387,405,443,568,99,171,377,436,459,464,515,523,298,403,432,488,18,384,388,487,517,608,100,120,163,174,190,217,348,368,597,126,178,210,226,323,437,176,229,376,450,612,222,224,373,382,536,1,25,118,136,139,231,287,404,245,566,581,216,257,279,347,375,434,449,498,378,594,180,511,600,605,191,580,592,167,221,438,439,496,559,346,389,407,447,582,172,202,321,173,214,168,170,187,207,583,21,235,353,504,505,567,601,604,20,22,250,462,502,501,460,497,101,169,2,4,6,19,96,256,320,512,562,588,606,610,620,15,164,611,140,500,603,409,602,322,5,516,619,14,591,510,607],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The text explicitly states that when the vehicle is stopped by emergency braking, the warning message will appear on the cluster.  This indicates that BCA's braking function is activated not just during lane changes, but also when the vehicle is brought to a sudden stop.  The braking control will end after approximately 2 seconds, but the warning message will remain until the driver depresses the brake pedal and checks the surroundings.  This feature is designed to alert the driver to potential hazards even when they are not actively changing lanes, providing an additional layer of safety.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[353,357,358,350,354,429,351,352,342,359,355,356,363,424,452,411,344,321,367,412,362,608,333,335,443,430,337,427,343,612,446,385,616,426,445,330,428,324,336,441,334,341,378,391,281,328,442,192,276,347,390,431,290,325,408,289,331,398,444,339,293,294,314,329,395,286,332,374,414,277,295,405,188,284,410,200,291,340,383,282,379,457,280,303,349,386,396,413,420,124,191,266,403,425,456,273,274,338,402,404,64,133,261,265,285,327,394,401,409,275,279,288,292,299,369,432,451,205,365,372,375,388,389,127,137,380,455,110,138,269,302,381,161,323,382,407,423,465,151,185,194,278,283,315,326,346,392,400,406,614,38,179,198,263,270,296,345,373,421,437,439,467,468,478,538,84,111,162,171,178,197,206,272,287,384,387,422,433,440,527,543,613,80,116,122,128,186,236,271,297,360,370,377,435,44,48,108,115,142,177,247,322,417,466,493,495,609,33,81,82,131,132,135,153,174,199,232,240,348,494,31,92,114,130,150,166,264,364,376,419,453,617,251,255,316,361,415,436,469,474,506,554,13,30,60,155,196,203,257,304,397,399,454,507,508,535,72,94,106,125,144,152,163,176,301,416,568,42,55,63,79,83,90,107,139,156,169,187,208,222,229,235,260,262,298,463,470,472,531,578,49,52,143,159,167,170,182,193,241,244,245,249,308,393,438,544,43,59,66,71,85,91,123,184,252,450,476,498,57,112,113,145,190,223,300,306,434,569,615,32,56,87,103,104,119,183,215,227,242,10,36,105,165,189,233,234,250,366,448,479,483,491,523,539,553,570,35,39,88,180,204,305,371,475,481,482,486,524,528,530,583,8,18,40,75,93,120,126,146,147,154,207,212,237,259,447,526,532,20,58,65,95,100,134,148,158,230,248,418,473,499,522,560,577,586,51,117,149,181,195,209,211,253,490,497,580,618,45,76,97,173,226,312,313,480,542,574,46,50,67,74,109,129,136,202,219,267,489,540,547,563,572,579,11,201,218,268,511,514,529,585,86,141,246,310,458,487,548,549,587,3,23,37,157,224,238,239,552,34,41,98,220,243,368,460,7,12,68,70,73,175,213,307,477,509,558,582,69,311,449,471,496,519,525,571,597,99,172,520,534,575,9,121,168,231,485,500,533,536,559,596,599,24,61,210,254,258,319,461,537,541,550,557,581,54,62,118,160,318,501,515,5,512,564,584,221,488,492,545,576,47,216,228,518,21,140,513,562,573,317,464,565,567,603,101,164,462,503,546,53,459,556,214,516,566,598,1,89,502,600,78,521,595,225,217,27,77,517,592,590,593,604,102,601,28,555,17,26,484,591,25,22,605,29,16,602,589,551,309,607,14,505,561,594,504,19,2,4,6,96,256,320,588,606,610,620,619,15,611,510],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

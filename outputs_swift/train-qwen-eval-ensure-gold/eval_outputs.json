{"question":"Where are the oven vents located on this range model, and why is their positioning important for proper oven function?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[12],"raw_output":"","pred":"The oven vents are located at the top of the oven cavity, as shown in the diagram. Specifically, there are vents on both the upper and lower sections of the oven door.\n\nThe positioning of these vents is crucial for proper oven function for several reasons:\n\n1. Air circulation: The vents allow hot air and moisture to escape from the oven cavity during cooking. This helps maintain even temperatures and ensures that food cooks consistently throughout the oven.\n\n2. Ventilation: Proper ventilation prevents the buildup of heat and moisture inside the oven, which can affect cooking performance and potentially damage the oven components.\n\n3. Temperature regulation: The vents help regulate the temperature inside the oven by allowing excess heat to escape. This is particularly important during the preheating process, where the oven needs to reach a specific temperature quickly.\n\n4. Safety: Proper ventilation helps prevent the accumulation of heat and moisture, which can be a fire hazard. It also helps maintain a safe environment for the oven's components.\n\n5. Cooking efficiency: By allowing hot air to escape, the vents help maintain the desired cooking temperature, which is essential for achieving the best results when baking, roasting, or broiling.\n\nIn summary, the oven vents are strategically positioned at the top of the oven cavity to facilitate proper air circulation, ventilation, temperature regulation, safety, and cooking efficiency.","source":"data/test/ywge745c0fs.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[1,12,3,10,22,4,16,11,17,32,9,33,34,19,5,6,24,31,36,38,2,26,13,14,27,35,30,28,29,7,15,37,25,20,23,21,8,39,18,40],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

These techniques involve pruning the activations to the pth percentile, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the representation. This truncation is based on the observation that high activations correspond to high parameter gradients, meaning that the truncated representation emphasizes the parameters that have undergone the most significant changes during training.\n\nThe underlying principle that explains the performance advantage of these methods is that the truncated representation captures the most critical information for the model's predictions. By concentrating on the gradients with the highest variation, ASH and similar techniques effectively project onto the gradients that are most relevant for the model's decision-making process. This approach enhances OOD detection by highlighting the features that are most likely to be different between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, thereby improving the model's ability to distinguish between them. The truncation process, therefore, acts as a form of dimensionality reduction that focuses on the most informative aspects of the model's learned representations, thereby improving its OOD detection capabilities.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[130,131,133,120,119,132,142,139,121,128,6,134,118,127,129,191,148,51,61,31,179,183,37,38,78,122,190,22,194,146,170,56,57,138,145,149,123,186,13,193,28,60,172,189,34,85,90,39,171,168,169,77,103,188,30,24,32,72,102,7,48,91,92,153,178,26,33,35,41,143,167,180,182,105,109,111,150,165,4,20,21,42,163,36,71,113,137,174,40,44,58,84,185,195,80,110,184,27,82,136,152,177,47,55,62,66,93,144,68,154,161,83,23,29,45,54,75,112,160,166,1,99,124,135,176,187,88,8,18,59,81,95,158,5,79,25,64,73,74,96,107,11,16,49,117,50,94,126,89,104,147,9,125,155,12,65,181,76,97,14,17,63,43,69,86,46,115,175,53,108,156,157,151,173,52,162,192,15,87,98,114,140,141,67,100,116,10,106,164,101,159,70,2,3,19],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof load capacity can lead to several safety risks. Firstly, the vehicle's center of gravity shifts higher, making it more susceptible to rollovers, especially at high speeds or during sudden maneuvers. This instability can result in loss of control, potentially leading to accidents. Secondly, the increased weight on the roof rack can damage the vehicle's structure, affecting its integrity and safety. Additionally, improperly secured cargo can slide or fall off the roof rack, posing a risk to other vehicles and pedestrians on the road.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to adhere to the specified weight limit of 100 kg (220 lbs) for the roof rack. Ensure that the load is evenly distributed across the crossbars and roof rack to maintain stability. Secure the cargo firmly to prevent it from shifting during transit. Avoid driving at high speeds, making sharp turns, or performing sudden maneuvers while carrying cargo on the roof rack. Regularly check the cargo's secureness before and during driving to ensure it remains safely in place. By following these guidelines, you can minimize the risks associated with exceeding the roof load capacity and maintain the safety of your vehicle and its occupants.","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[249,302,482,39,274,312,546,73,319,31,149,280,311,316,80,310,542,13,131,519,306,492,236,258,483,44,148,303,418,541,42,201,301,309,344,263,454,596,94,315,507,547,49,269,307,395,238,479,66,122,444,43,95,281,130,305,617,74,79,481,129,253,317,513,69,88,268,313,318,10,63,116,203,243,275,285,491,514,45,240,548,67,87,198,357,455,51,65,71,92,292,391,486,509,539,549,85,159,220,244,456,495,538,40,61,93,143,218,252,410,493,72,104,150,156,291,398,489,518,544,563,55,84,105,248,267,314,336,442,24,30,48,83,133,283,290,350,390,452,476,494,545,558,7,11,41,111,125,141,183,211,296,400,425,429,578,32,36,90,151,289,293,393,475,485,614,86,175,192,261,304,590,70,147,242,308,618,52,64,110,246,265,327,337,352,91,102,270,349,412,457,565,35,68,155,204,212,427,446,478,570,585,586,8,123,137,196,297,342,468,506,537,584,17,53,181,227,230,351,355,359,423,571,81,219,341,420,37,108,127,282,472,499,521,572,9,23,234,295,445,461,54,56,103,114,247,260,273,330,335,419,467,616,12,29,33,144,146,262,430,526,28,46,57,135,166,241,255,294,324,326,333,356,358,413,451,470,560,561,58,134,200,228,232,251,325,415,473,474,508,532,533,615,3,107,205,362,428,440,490,59,213,366,424,527,82,142,145,158,233,286,339,367,530,552,564,573,199,371,374,381,414,453,480,577,579,613,76,132,138,161,165,299,361,363,372,543,555,587,157,162,194,237,354,380,465,554,47,75,124,152,195,197,284,360,365,394,435,463,471,575,38,98,189,193,458,528,553,106,128,209,259,264,345,385,417,431,441,466,525,50,185,208,271,343,524,153,154,223,331,397,477,557,569,589,598,16,34,60,89,117,184,215,332,411,551,595,97,113,300,383,396,406,448,531,534,535,550,26,27,160,408,556,112,115,364,416,520,574,62,119,266,272,276,288,402,422,433,503,540,599,109,182,239,254,329,369,469,522,576,188,328,340,386,421,484,529,593,609,78,179,225,277,399,426,121,338,379,392,401,77,177,186,206,278,334,370,387,405,443,568,99,171,377,436,459,464,515,523,298,403,432,488,18,384,388,487,517,608,100,120,163,174,190,217,348,368,597,126,178,210,226,323,437,176,229,376,450,612,222,224,373,382,536,1,25,118,136,139,231,287,404,245,566,581,216,257,279,347,375,434,449,498,378,594,180,511,600,605,191,580,592,167,221,438,439,496,559,346,389,407,447,582,172,202,321,173,214,168,170,187,207,583,21,235,353,504,505,567,601,604,20,22,250,462,502,501,460,497,101,169,2,4,6,19,96,256,320,512,562,588,606,610,620,15,164,611,140,500,603,409,602,322,5,516,619,14,591,510,607],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This represents an increase of $8,145,000, or approximately 1.3% from the previous year.\n\nThe increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost suggests that the company has taken on more debt or has refinanced existing debt. This could imply several strategic implications:\n\n1. **Expansion and Growth**: The company may be investing in new projects or expanding its operations, which requires additional capital.\n2. **Debt Refinancing**: The company might be refinancing existing debt to improve its financial terms, such as interest rates or maturity dates.\n3. **Financial Leverage**: The increase could indicate a higher level of financial leverage, which can be both beneficial for growth and risky if not managed properly.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the increase is relatively small, it could still have significant implications for the company's financial health and risk profile. The company should monitor these liabilities closely to ensure they align with its strategic goals and financial stability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_GPRK_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[204,205,186,107,180,196,206,218,183,24,176,210,108,170,23,27,116,198,106,127,45,207,222,184,171,174,147,173,12,41,103,119,163,192,35,113,115,181,185,55,154,165,11,21,31,168,169,188,189,224,20,152,211,231,61,79,118,178,209,220,246,22,104,117,120,160,230,36,39,135,137,145,175,179,191,197,225,18,51,121,208,105,153,161,40,88,95,109,26,111,214,66,199,249,167,172,60,64,151,223,114,125,193,38,70,134,80,158,213,46,62,219,67,177,200,212,227,32,71,17,57,142,187,93,126,228,232,29,63,162,164,166,195,42,77,241,34,56,73,112,226,25,30,54,194,242,33,37,69,102,130,143,190,215,229,50,53,248,59,97,250,49,76,91,131,182,90,129,221,16,81,122,146,217,44,78,240,253,10,68,3,13,19,43,48,157,251,15,75,58,110,4,14,86,233,247,150,236,243,89,92,99,149,239,252,28,96,98,201,203,257,259,133,244,74,132,65,87,128,83,216,100,139,141,235,256,138,85,5,72,84,124,156,144,148,245,255,101,1,2,8,136,237,52,155,254,47,258,140,123,234,238,202,82,159,260,9,6,94,7],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"How does the choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) influence the network's ability to model interactions between vertices, and what are the implications of using a product aggregation operator in this context?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[61],"raw_output":"","pred":"The choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) significantly influences the network's ability to model interactions between vertices. In a GNN, the AGGREGATE function combines the hidden embeddings of a vertex's neighbors to update its own embedding. This aggregation step is crucial as it determines how information from neighboring vertices is integrated into the central vertex's representation.\n\nWhen the AGGREGATE function is a product aggregation operator, it allows the GNN to model interactions between vertices in a polynomial manner. Specifically, the product aggregation operator combines the hidden embeddings of neighboring vertices by taking their element-wise product. This means that the updated embedding of a vertex is a polynomial function of its neighbors' embeddings, which can capture more complex interactions than simple sums or averages.\n\nThe implications of using a product aggregation operator are profound. It enables the GNN to model higher-order interactions, which are essential for capturing intricate relationships within the graph. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where the relationships between entities are not linear but involve more complex dependencies. By allowing the network to model these interactions, the GNN can potentially achieve better performance in tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, where understanding the nuanced relationships between nodes is crucial.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,62,57,172,60,58,177,5,175,176,64,180,173,179,9,59,178,186,3,65,63,71,174,74,67,204,86,76,142,203,202,68,69,72,79,82,78,84,53,4,196,40,8,41,80,85,77,81,144,184,190,23,25,183,83,187,182,7,35,193,87,88,181,13,27,50,75,167,39,89,36,70,147,33,26,52,205,14,92,21,22,42,195,11,185,54,141,188,96,24,44,66,146,38,206,12,29,32,51,189,95,56,197,55,143,148,151,149,191,100,199,132,16,49,20,119,121,122,128,47,109,159,43,105,18,37,171,201,19,150,192,34,90,94,125,133,138,30,48,111,170,198,46,17,91,15,97,158,45,120,126,200,93,194,10,168,118,145,156,2,31,103,104,164,1,153,161,28,108,110,129,154,163,98,160,123,112,169,106,107,130,134,135,139,115,131,124,137,152,113,116,136,140,162,155,127,157,99,101,165,114,166,102,117,6,73],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Investors must pay fees for depositing or withdrawing shares, which are typically $5.00 or less per 100 ADSs. Additionally, any cash distribution to ADS holders incurs a fee equivalent to the fee that would be payable if the securities distributed had been shares and the shares had been deposited for issuance of ADSs. These fees can accumulate over time, potentially reducing the overall value of the investment.\n\nCurrency conversion is another significant factor. The ADSs are denominated in U.S. dollars, but the underlying shares may be denominated in Renminbi (RMB). Fluctuations in the exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars can significantly impact the value of the ADSs. Appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar can reduce the value of the ADSs, while depreciation can increase their value. Investors must also consider the costs associated with converting RMB into U.S. dollars, which can further reduce the net value of their investment.\n\nOverall, these fees and currency conversion risks can negatively impact the value of an investor's ADSs, making it crucial to monitor exchange rate movements and potential fees to manage the investment effectively.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,55,52,126,51,119,127,175,9,10,4,177,33,123,174,169,15,124,122,159,162,203,28,200,27,47,38,8,50,54,125,56,57,118,163,44,204,170,11,17,142,164,168,176,167,189,196,35,121,130,165,197,145,161,115,120,179,207,173,158,37,148,202,157,178,160,166,172,149,150,151,186,22,191,16,93,147,188,199,12,180,194,152,192,39,190,206,154,182,156,181,187,205,21,36,88,184,18,25,32,193,195,201,40,153,171,42,198,41,1,63,34,46,146,155,183,31,104,29,106,20,24,114,62,143,26,49,105,19,67,81,185,45,91,30,92,267,102,103,248,58,76,258,2,131,23,86,97,5,87,111,66,109,80,82,84,98,117,53,70,85,101,257,61,59,64,133,256,65,100,129,268,220,230,241,3,128,221,247,95,289,290,68,75,78,99,132,269,94,210,250,282,209,271,281,43,60,110,211,240,249,278,288,71,108,219,265,279,83,141,229,291,116,266,69,89,90,112,264,138,259,285,232,212,218,270,74,293,238,231,77,96,107,251,7,134,135,216,233,79,213,260,73,239,286,223,292,136,208,237,246,255,13,113,252,284,14,217,222,243,6,72,228,234,273,283,272,242,287,137,263,262,277,144,245,275,280,214,139,294,236,224,253,215,235,140,227,261,226,254,276,244,274,225],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The Sinkhorn algorithm, originally developed for optimal transport problems, is adapted here to estimate a correspondence matrix Π that maps embeddings from one domain to another. This matrix is used to optimize the embeddings of the target domain (AY) to better align with the source domain (AX).\n\nIn each iteration, the Sinkhorn algorithm is applied to estimate Π using the current approximation of the remaining anchors (AY) and the initial seed anchors (AX). This estimated correspondence helps in refining the embeddings of AY to ensure that the relative distances between embeddings in AY are consistent with those in AX. The objective function, which minimizes the mean squared error between the relative projections of AX and AY, is optimized to achieve this alignment.\n\nAfter convergence, the optimized embeddings of AY are discretized to form the final set of parallel anchors. This iterative process, combined with the Sinkhorn algorithm, allows the AO method to efficiently discover new parallel anchors from a limited initial set, thereby reducing the reliance on a large number of parallel anchors and improving the semantic correspondence between domains.","source":"data/test/2406.11014.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[78,77,79,47,13,15,19,60,105,41,57,48,67,101,95,63,85,62,54,114,58,25,55,75,102,46,109,34,74,103,3,70,29,9,71,118,53,125,130,97,104,84,91,127,35,36,96,117,107,11,32,39,20,45,69,115,128,17,33,49,124,126,18,51,94,121,72,123,132,59,61,76,52,87,113,131,56,30,50,73,8,31,120,129,112,133,16,21,26,122,40,42,83,134,22,43,93,110,119,106,4,6,10,12,14,24,28,38,44,64,66,68,80,82,88,90,92,98,100,1,86,116,7,5,99,108,89,111,27,37,81,2,65,23],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This indicates that AGTDM - t3s1 is highly effective at detecting sinusoidal dependencies, while rdmCor is largely ineffective for this type of relationship.\n\nThe other tests, such as MI (k=20), AGTDM - t1s1, and AGTDM - t2s1, also show relatively high average powers for sinusoidal relationships, but AGTDM - t3s1 stands out as the most powerful among them. This suggests that the AGTDM - t3s1 test is particularly well-suited for detecting sinusoidal dependencies in data.","source":"data/test/2408.11948.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[96,93,95,94,97,98,100,99,14,19,103,83,3,89,84,149,105,69,36,101,163,38,40,74,32,86,13,46,64,82,58,63,76,39,49,80,73,90,6,9,87,104,148,43,28,30,71,142,25,77,92,4,56,110,121,29,75,102,140,50,11,59,79,137,165,119,35,41,61,72,91,162,78,88,147,160,18,68,151,153,47,48,67,113,33,53,55,60,114,122,157,5,12,24,62,117,168,10,34,45,70,143,144,145,146,154,52,156,112,120,128,107,118,42,65,123,133,155,54,81,85,141,15,44,111,161,37,115,132,31,159,164,124,125,167,7,17,27,66,57,106,158,134,136,166,51,109,139,16,126,127,129,150,135,116,138,108,130,131,21,1,20,152,8,22,26,23,2],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Another key metric is the time to neutralize threats, which assesses the average time taken by defenders to detect, engage, and neutralize invaders. Shorter times suggest a more responsive and efficient defense system.\n\nLong-term adaptability can be evaluated through metrics such as resource efficiency, which analyzes how effectively the defenders utilize their available resources to maximize interception rates and minimize response times. The adaptability score reflects the defense system’s ability to adapt to new or evolving threats over time, including the incorporation of lessons learned from past invasions to improve future defense responses. This score can be calculated as the number of adaptations to new threats divided by the total number of encountered threats.\n\nBy combining these metrics, a comprehensive assessment of the defense strategy’s effectiveness can be achieved, ensuring that it not only performs well in the short term but also remains robust and adaptable to evolving threats.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[445,447,446,454,39,67,334,465,105,312,139,187,442,81,248,433,437,439,457,102,108,51,93,112,188,415,155,96,260,269,11,45,113,416,83,98,436,450,470,36,37,117,118,256,332,393,207,262,392,474,97,166,178,335,395,432,438,451,245,430,449,17,94,103,333,425,19,60,176,422,458,9,65,251,401,440,448,33,35,72,100,101,193,255,417,429,435,452,466,247,424,76,138,200,41,156,198,441,444,467,66,110,143,394,40,59,88,109,129,242,338,354,397,420,431,104,259,325,434,468,38,95,127,337,426,443,12,58,99,144,270,294,372,376,411,43,61,400,404,27,71,130,252,350,407,456,469,16,44,106,148,179,214,246,257,396,419,428,478,5,15,78,84,87,168,180,240,402,459,29,107,111,282,347,453,460,18,119,73,115,151,234,366,455,353,413,79,211,261,77,91,120,140,141,250,374,472,473,34,56,137,142,414,206,212,236,306,418,85,90,167,201,213,26,186,243,249,356,403,421,464,42,195,461,471,68,89,135,244,336,14,116,232,368,381,149,210,219,235,339,427,24,55,348,373,377,133,192,233,238,343,379,408,258,387,169,190,263,375,410,412,1,23,114,157,209,346,384,483,228,382,399,383,423,463,123,154,199,227,385,52,300,359,50,147,159,160,288,362,406,485,4,57,92,132,48,409,22,370,380,80,122,124,145,208,340,405,202,398,75,128,152,276,319,344,388,134,136,241,345,316,342,371,32,46,70,484,8,63,131,476,10,54,82,21,189,229,239,314,328,358,386,462,479,223,225,341,365,6,7,121,194,283,326,329,158,171,191,215,327,331,486,313,378,30,153,161,196,284,315,317,352,369,126,162,172,216,217,330,349,86,165,253,295,13,267,361,25,220,291,318,363,367,49,174,237,264,297,308,231,296,475,47,221,268,278,285,286,351,390,31,203,289,309,355,477,20,265,266,277,301,302,321,389,164,185,290,310,357,360,481,53,173,204,287,311,364,391,64,163,224,271,272,273,299,320,480,183,218,222,298,170,181,184,205,150,226,303,28,182,292,307,487,279,482,3,293,125,197,322,323,254,304,177,280,324,274,281,305,69,275,175,2,62,230,146,74],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

While (X × X)-translation equivariance requires a function to be equivariant under all translations in the product space X × X, DTE focuses on equivariance under translations along the diagonal of this product space. This means that for a function to be DTE, it must satisfy the condition π ◦ T(τ,τ) = T(τ,τ) ◦ π for all τ ∈ X, where T(τ,τ) represents a diagonal translation.\n\nThe significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9 lies in the ability to leverage the properties of diagonal translations. By duplicating the inputs, the authors can transform the problem of proving equivariance under general translations into one that involves diagonal translations. This transformation is crucial because it allows them to apply Theorem 4.8, which characterizes functions that are equivariant under diagonal translations.

The decrease in Property and equipment and disallowed business interest expense suggests a reduction in assets that are not currently deductible, potentially lowering future tax expenses. Conversely, the increase in employee compensation and benefits and capitalized research and development expenses implies an increase in deductible expenses, which could increase future tax liabilities.\n\nOverall, these changes suggest a net decrease in net deferred tax assets, which could lead to lower future tax liabilities.

This indicates that the model is learning effectively and improving its performance on the validation set. The accuracy peaks at around 38.5% and then stabilizes, suggesting that the model has reached a point of good performance and is not overfitting to the training data.\n\nFor perplexity (Figure 7.11), the trend is more complex. Initially, the perplexity decreases sharply from 126 at 5k steps to around 113 at 40k steps, indicating that the model is becoming more efficient at generating text that matches the training data. However, there is a slight increase in perplexity after 20k steps, which might suggest that the model is starting to overfit or that the data is becoming more challenging to generalize from. The perplexity stabilizes at around 116, which is still relatively low, indicating that the model is maintaining a good balance between complexity and generalization.\n\nOverall, these trends suggest that the GA→EN model is converging well, with both accuracy and perplexity improving significantly as training progresses.

Firstly, increasing the pick-and-place nozzle diameter could allow for better contact with components, thereby accommodating larger and heavier components. This would enable the system to handle components with a mass greater than 65g, such as larger batteries or more complex electronic modules. Secondly, reducing the nozzle diameter could increase the precision and stability of the pick-and-place mechanism, allowing for the handling of smaller components like SMD resistors down to size 2010. This would enhance the system's versatility and reduce the need for manual intervention.\n\nAdditionally, upgrading the pump suction to a stronger model could increase the lifting capacity, allowing for the handling of taller components like rotors or thicker circuit boards. This would expand the system's ability to fabricate devices with more complex geometries and materials. Finally, incorporating a smaller nozzle and a longer lead screw could further increase the system's precision and range, enabling it to handle a broader spectrum of components and materials.

This function is a two-source non-malleable extractor, which is designed to extract a uniformly random string from two correlated sources of randomness, even when one of the sources is tampered with by an adversary.\n\nIn the protocol, Alice and Bob share a random string \\( W \\) and their local sources of randomness \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) respectively. At the beginning of the protocol, Eve, the adversary, can corrupt one party's memory. The 2NMExt function is applied to the tampered and uncorrupted sources to extract a uniformly random string \\( R \\). This extraction process is robust against tampering, as it ensures that even if one of the sources is corrupted, the extracted string remains uniformly random and independent of the tampered source.\n\nThe protocol then splits \\( R \\) into three parts and exchanges them between Alice and Bob. If the exchange is successful, the last part of \\( R \\) is the shared uniform string. This process ensures that even if Eve tampers with the communication channel, the shared secret remains secure and uniformly random, as long as the adversary does not tamper with both sources simultaneously.

The doctor's role shifts to a more supervisory and interpretative one. The AI system, consisting of a DNN-based module and a DNN visual explanation module, performs the initial diagnosis and generates a clinical description. The doctor then reviews the AI-generated diagnosis and visual explanations, ensuring accuracy and providing final approval. This integration allows the doctor to focus on critical decision-making and validation, rather than the routine analysis of retinal images.

This small change is what allows the model to be fooled, even though it appears to be imperceptible to human observation.\n\nThis visual comparison highlights the importance of developing robust machine learning models that are resistant to adversarial attacks, as these can have significant real-world implications for applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and financial systems.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[10,52,14,45,79,81,141,16,140,8,43,161,9,130,76,11,89,158,67,53,40,157,116,13,15,144,78,145,156,138,33,105,58,160,55,70,131,137,12,174,73,74,170,180,122,21,61,62,86,17,90,108,195,96,182,134,84,42,54,124,95,128,149,83,155,48,113,114,143,188,23,92,153,189,94,80,82,187,93,87,109,193,57,85,171,97,133,163,176,22,56,71,77,110,194,6,20,88,190,125,169,72,101,104,183,27,50,123,167,168,44,175,177,107,112,172,179,39,154,162,59,75,106,68,181,38,147,7,46,2,115,120,148,173,184,36,69,51,1,41,103,166,192,19,65,165,3,30,100,142,178,185,28,117,127,159,24,126,129,146,191,63,102,34,64,98,119,121,136,5,49,111,151,29,135,186,18,25,118,132,60,91,47,152,31,4,164,26,66,35,139,99,150,32,37],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The economic uncertainty and ongoing labor market conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, likely affected client and candidate confidence, leading to longer decision times and elongated sales cycles. This could have reduced the number of new projects and hires, impacting revenue and profitability. Additionally, the company's strategic investments in technology and talent solutions might have strained its financial resources, affecting its ability to maintain high levels of profitability. The company's focus on repurchasing shares and distributing dividends could also have contributed to the lower per share amounts, as these activities reduce the number of shares outstanding and the total amount of dividends paid per share.","source":"data/test/NYSE_RHI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[4,5,7,6,61,41,46,44,35,33,37,49,62,39,42,55,34,38,40,56,57,36,43,25,8,59,16,31,23,45,52,21,24,48,54,3,32,73,53,60,18,64,10,30,11,17,9,28,66,27,65,20,96,29,50,47,70,1,63,68,13,22,75,58,15,84,87,86,78,67,69,79,19,85,82,95,97,77,74,12,88,98,51,76,80,90,92,14,83,81,72,93,89,94,71,99,91,100,2,26],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This is because the ISP associates the MAC address with the specific computer and its unique network configuration.\n\nA potential issue arises if the router's default LAN IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1) conflicts with the IP range of your existing ADSL modem/router.  This conflict prevents the router from communicating with the modem, resulting in no internet access.  To resolve this, you need to change the router's LAN IP address to a unique one that doesn't overlap with your existing modem/router's IP range.

The text warns that explosive hydrogen gas is always present near the battery, and covering it with a moist cloth can help absorb any gas that escapes, reducing the chance of an explosion.\n\n2. It provides a barrier between the battery and the jumper cables. The moist cloth acts as a buffer, preventing direct contact between the battery terminals and the jumper cables, which could cause sparks and potential fire hazards.\n\n3.

Instead, the inability to generate appropriate actions appears to be the more common issue.","source":"data/test/2408.16098.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[120,121,122,130,126,13,10,109,80,15,127,12,79,119,123,114,118,110,33,78,81,77,125,131,9,55,91,94,95,148,90,116,83,112,92,45,105,56,93,124,115,107,34,133,134,73,99,63,47,74,97,40,98,106,117,35,82,154,159,21,29,20,64,76,103,6,104,11,102,113,144,108,140,153,18,30,38,141,146,158,162,100,129,139,156,19,66,70,150,36,46,65,86,135,145,43,84,85,142,161,111,147,16,31,59,101,44,48,96,27,87,132,160,28,37,138,39,58,67,149,51,62,143,152,57,69,71,61,7,25,50,157,32,42,53,8,52,72,136,155,151,22,89,14,137,23,60,75,68,88,5,17,24,4,163,54,41,128,1,26,49,2,3],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Explain the potential implications of these trends for the company's ESG strategy.","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[52],"raw_output":"","pred":"From 2018 to 2022, the company's engagement with corporate management teams saw a significant increase. The number of equity engagements rose from 1,324 in 2018 to 3,439 in 2022, while credit engagements increased from 1,728 to 1,254. This indicates a growing focus on engaging with issuers across both equity and credit sectors.\n\nHowever, the percentage of AUM engaged in public equity shows a more nuanced trend. While it increased from 71% in 2020 to 85% in 2022, it actually decreased from 78% in 2021. This suggests that while the company is engaging with more issuers, the proportion of their total assets under management (AUM) that is actively engaged in public equity is not increasing at the same rate.\n\nThe implications of these trends for the company's ESG strategy are significant. The increased engagement with corporate management teams could lead to more effective ESG integration and better alignment with clients' ESG goals. However, the slight decrease in AUM engagement might indicate challenges in scaling up engagement efforts across the entire portfolio. This could potentially limit the company's ability to drive broader ESG improvements across its entire investment base. The company may need to balance increased engagement with issuer management with strategies to scale engagement across its entire AUM to fully realize the benefits of its ESG strategy.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NHS_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[52,35,28,48,55,49,10,5,6,11,36,39,63,13,53,4,8,30,54,2,42,45,56,29,9,14,44,17,16,24,34,60,46,31,25,57,20,23,37,47,62,21,3,33,7,43,61,22,32,38,15,64,58,12,41,50,59,40,1,18,26,27,51,19],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The text notes that while constrained margins have high CMI values for some tasks, suggesting inherent difficulty in generalization prediction, the resulting scatter plots of mean constrained margin vs. test accuracy do not show points in the lower right (large margin but low generalization) or upper left (small margin but high generalization) quadrants. This implies that a larger mean constrained margin is generally beneficial to a model's generalization, but may not always fully describe its performance.\n\nThis limitation relates to the field of adversarial examples in that it suggests current complexity measures may not fully capture the nuances of model behavior that lead to adversarial vulnerability. Adversarial examples are perturbations that can cause models to misclassify inputs, often by exploiting small variations in the input space. If margin-based measures are not sensitive enough to detect these subtle variations, they may not be effective in predicting which models are more susceptible to adversarial attacks. This highlights a potential gap in our understanding of how to accurately measure and predict generalization and robustness in deep learning models, particularly in the context of adversarial examples.","source":"data/test/2405.17445.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[123,17,143,16,19,3,145,6,4,78,34,22,32,73,104,31,18,46,139,103,12,35,101,136,7,131,132,140,146,5,20,25,44,70,135,26,144,147,29,71,83,80,120,137,30,36,84,110,111,41,81,24,28,138,47,124,99,79,27,33,150,21,42,45,82,100,23,114,39,141,40,112,113,148,149,66,122,77,105,98,13,64,10,130,37,97,119,142,69,49,95,43,48,76,118,11,60,116,72,96,125,161,38,55,15,94,63,102,158,53,54,121,1,9,52,107,153,155,59,62,92,117,88,50,157,68,74,106,160,162,58,65,67,115,156,51,61,87,91,163,108,154,56,8,90,75,109,159,86,93,126,57,129,89,152,165,127,85,151,134,128,14,164,2,133],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As network complexity increases, the average distortion required for a successful adversarial attack decreases. This is evident from the decreasing average distortion values across the table, from 0.123 for FC10-4 to 0.086 for FC100-100-10 and 0.087 for FC200-200-10.\n\n2. Simultaneously, the average persistence of adversarial examples increases with network complexity. The persistence values for adversarial examples rise from 1.68 for FC10-4 to 0.56 for both FC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10.\n\n3. This trend suggests that more complex networks are more robust to adversarial attacks. They require less distortion to be misclassified, but the resulting adversarial examples are more stable and less likely to be misclassified by other networks.\n\n4. The context indicates that networks with more parameters are more likely to exhibit decision boundaries with more curvature, which may explain why they are more robust to adversarial attacks.\n\n5. The table also shows that natural images tend to have higher persistence than adversarial examples, regardless of network complexity. This further underscores the instability of adversarial examples compared to natural images.\n\nIn summary, more complex networks are less sensitive to adversarial attacks, requiring less distortion to misclassify and resulting in more stable adversarial examples.","source":"data/test/2407.11029v1.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[72,71,69,156,16,154,44,8,58,54,46,60,84,55,40,62,75,9,15,21,61,83,76,158,85,48,70,74,43,59,39,82,52,73,56,68,143,157,5,17,155,41,49,145,142,50,23,45,14,18,38,10,113,51,105,177,189,4,78,190,7,138,176,79,22,42,144,181,47,53,63,192,77,87,118,20,180,160,186,179,152,129,182,188,194,86,25,153,172,80,171,193,92,187,103,137,97,122,174,12,88,94,112,106,111,173,110,57,109,27,93,170,32,13,81,139,184,66,128,146,168,31,130,133,134,165,127,147,195,108,115,136,148,95,107,123,91,117,120,124,167,6,29,90,125,149,185,28,140,178,175,1,65,67,102,114,26,37,89,116,119,131,132,169,104,191,135,161,33,96,11,24,34,101,30,35,121,183,64,164,36,141,159,162,150,163,98,166,99,126,151,19,2,100,3],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

The geopolitical tensions could lead to increased uncertainty and volatility in global energy markets, potentially affecting the demand for carbon capture and storage technologies. This uncertainty could influence Dril-Quip's investment in CCUS projects, as companies may become more cautious about committing to long-term investments in the face of geopolitical instability.\n\nAdditionally, the geopolitical factors could impact the availability and cost of raw materials and labor, which are crucial for Dril-Quip's manufacturing operations. Any disruptions in supply chains or increased costs could affect the company's profitability and operational efficiency. Furthermore, the geopolitical tensions might influence the regulatory environment, potentially leading to changes in carbon pricing and incentives for CCUS projects, which could impact the viability of such collaborations.\n\nIn response, Dril-Quip may need to reassess its risk management strategies and diversify its customer base to mitigate the effects of geopolitical uncertainties. The company might also need to adapt its partnership model with Aker Solutions, ensuring that the collaboration remains resilient and responsive to changing geopolitical conditions. This could involve developing contingency plans for supply chain disruptions and exploring alternative sources of raw materials and labor to maintain operational stability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_DRQ_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[13,8,12,20,11,21,38,5,9,16,22,39,6,23,65,25,60,40,48,26,85,18,24,30,49,57,86,14,87,4,33,52,79,17,31,10,27,55,29,36,58,46,3,53,28,56,19,62,74,1,15,70,66,43,59,75,78,42,47,76,81,45,71,34,35,32,63,91,92,54,64,67,84,44,89,41,72,82,61,77,69,80,51,83,7,68,50,73,90,2,88,37],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The X-sync speed for the mechanical shutter is 1/200 sec. In contrast, the electronic 1st curtain shutter has a narrower range of shutter speeds from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, also including Bulb mode, with the same set increment of 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop. The X-sync speed for the electronic 1st curtain shutter is 1/250 sec.\n\nThese differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds impact the use of flash in several ways. The wider range of shutter speeds for the mechanical shutter allows for more flexibility in capturing fast-moving subjects or in low-light conditions, as it can be set to slower speeds. However, the electronic 1st curtain shutter, with its faster X-sync speed, is more suitable for high-speed flash photography, as it can synchronize with the flash at a faster shutter speed, ensuring that the flash light is captured sharply. This is particularly useful in situations where the subject is moving quickly or in low-light conditions where a faster shutter speed is necessary to freeze motion.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[908,161,162,910,174,177,298,299,170,869,164,384,163,344,870,179,500,868,165,499,150,286,218,181,291,894,899,293,3,294,296,887,4,224,905,906,184,223,297,874,195,339,147,826,116,152,204,132,172,336,417,825,840,131,144,312,681,135,502,113,157,387,688,830,833,838,867,892,133,145,173,180,313,388,75,156,212,167,215,308,185,301,348,350,904,137,140,338,349,72,74,176,96,159,199,219,269,432,791,824,837,885,206,821,898,149,380,849,122,130,143,155,295,352,818,909,5,115,136,300,335,102,211,503,843,57,175,198,221,316,345,871,913,50,168,205,333,828,886,889,891,114,134,169,253,138,171,376,872,151,318,395,83,202,213,226,282,337,434,829,77,119,139,158,207,216,407,35,285,394,726,127,178,355,382,460,835,153,186,209,343,393,405,633,112,182,214,274,341,367,392,739,183,200,266,76,81,94,277,278,281,836,91,324,386,419,492,795,832,20,193,275,381,383,841,290,303,442,596,630,2,89,187,210,486,615,789,839,34,80,95,188,228,241,248,262,307,311,317,323,374,437,469,866,106,121,203,267,268,276,391,471,787,806,33,90,107,120,148,160,217,321,418,732,817,897,31,87,92,98,192,231,279,280,707,93,97,100,283,284,496,700,822,108,146,190,334,340,875,32,104,189,232,314,385,433,446,458,501,808,110,287,406,429,454,476,508,888,99,124,166,257,330,342,411,450,459,485,541,579,7,85,239,420,489,28,264,320,487,616,8,73,105,117,118,390,641,763,842,884,18,225,265,315,463,488,807,834,878,61,70,84,103,288,322,474,493,504,674,809,6,17,123,194,201,230,252,309,326,328,438,447,509,511,661,788,907,67,208,449,738,810,863,880,25,78,451,786,815,877,254,365,366,416,436,445,587,624,666,895,26,42,111,443,475,675,733,758,760,38,109,222,234,235,260,423,428,430,461,512,519,537,557,590,725,794,54,101,196,242,261,271,289,319,331,864,914,86,129,351,507,577,585,653,659,59,125,233,247,258,378,422,431,481,667,697,711,762,812,823,126,236,246,306,346,353,531,544,197,396,468,483,540,621,628,844,858,82,237,368,371,441,505,873,240,372,373,421,425,426,455,497,792,27,154,229,347,424,453,631,636,642,677,698,71,88,227,238,245,305,327,332,427,477,597,614,663,737,896,244,250,357,413,495,612,651,715,816,820,854,325,401,440,467,498,543,607,632,695,736,800,802,354,400,457,464,568,618,669,671,673,742,778,790,797,9,142,369,479,480,526,528,529,539,583,634,660,679,734,798,805,911,60,220,259,439,466,708,743,65,255,270,272,273,359,482,538,640,683,689,705,717,718,727,783,304,399,402,462,470,490,513,514,516,527,534,542,582,603,617,620,622,645,676,703,710,714,752,776,22,364,409,452,465,472,494,520,545,561,576,588,602,662,709,735,744,745,793,819,52,403,525,535,604,649,650,657,685,690,721,755,761,861,912,79,243,398,518,532,567,601,639,652,654,682,731,30,128,478,484,510,572,600,629,648,655,680,722,764,777,21,51,63,435,448,536,562,635,701,704,712,741,766,801,902,916,251,444,560,605,637,706,730,782,785,827,883,16,191,414,558,569,608,647,658,672,699,740,813,881,45,46,62,404,523,625,696,724,831,862,893,903,19,24,360,379,491,552,686,694,719,723,751,767,846,853,855,900,10,44,64,370,410,456,584,586,609,665,670,720,746,753,799,901,36,292,329,412,524,613,729,771,40,69,408,415,473,549,578,589,716,775,780,796,851,310,517,565,573,598,623,643,656,687,693,702,748,749,754,768,804,23,43,47,49,515,547,556,559,591,362,522,530,551,553,570,574,575,592,610,668,249,377,521,580,581,664,678,747,857,859,141,550,611,644,692,781,845,11,15,58,68,619,765,784,865,1,56,571,546,564,594,595,713,848,256,506,533,554,599,684,750,779,860,66,356,626,774,847,850,555,691,856,263,375,563,890,29,358,361,728,772,548,593,606,757,759,876,53,566,769,770,773,882,389,646,37,39,811,879,915,919,852,302,756,41,14,917,397,814,627,48,13,363,803,12,55,638,918],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Given the data in Table 2, what is the likely impact on tracking error and acceleration if the batch size is further increased beyond 1000, and why?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[66],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the data in Table 2, if the batch size is further increased beyond 1000, it is likely that both tracking error and acceleration would continue to increase. \n\nThe table shows that as the batch size increases from 1 to 1000, there is a gradual improvement in success rate, with the highest success rate of 100% achieved at a batch size of 1000. However, the tracking error and acceleration metrics actually show a slight increase at the highest batch size of 1000 compared to the previous batch sizes.\n\nThis suggests that while larger batch sizes generally improve the optimizer's ability to find feasible trajectories, there is a point of diminishing returns. At very large batch sizes, the optimizer may be spending more time exploring the solution space without finding significantly better trajectories. This could lead to increased tracking error and acceleration as the optimizer struggles to find a good compromise between collision avoidance and trajectory smoothness.\n\nThe trend of increasing error and acceleration at very large batch sizes aligns with the observation that the optimizer may be taking detours to avoid collisions, which can lead to less optimal trajectories. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation becomes less effective at very large batch sizes, potentially resulting in suboptimal solutions.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[66,65,67,94,75,57,26,63,52,46,64,53,93,12,19,81,82,83,56,8,95,10,100,49,14,61,54,68,98,101,55,92,90,27,47,60,44,18,37,20,48,96,77,91,71,85,78,29,43,50,6,17,32,35,70,76,80,110,34,99,89,102,103,79,87,107,45,69,41,59,84,42,24,2,112,7,30,11,31,74,86,33,15,51,58,21,62,106,38,72,28,23,25,104,108,36,39,109,88,73,13,16,97,105,40,3,9,22,5,111,4,1],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

However, in this case, \\( q \\) is not obtained via the maximum entropy principle because \\( H(p) < H(q) \\), even though \\( q \\) is also in \\( B \\). This indicates that the maximum entropy principle does not yield all maximal elements of \\( \\preceq_U \\) in \\( B \\).\n\nThe implications for optimization of injective monotones in preordered spaces are significant. While injective monotones can represent maximal elements, they do not necessarily capture all maximal elements, especially when constraints are involved. This highlights the limitations of using injective monotones for optimization, as they may not always yield the optimal solution. Therefore, when dealing with preordered spaces, it is crucial to consider the specific constraints and the nature of the preorder to ensure that the optimization process is effective and yields the desired results.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[154,74,152,153,165,189,149,163,166,178,180,191,54,190,51,322,148,151,50,49,80,266,158,179,310,341,360,99,157,183,186,184,301,169,255,339,359,185,188,265,351,78,312,354,363,29,55,150,156,193,263,336,59,146,167,187,300,308,320,345,352,64,283,305,92,104,307,343,93,160,164,194,247,319,325,333,337,108,242,249,262,297,335,72,82,97,107,170,196,313,342,362,96,192,197,256,338,346,357,364,159,162,282,304,332,198,251,287,311,318,340,73,147,161,175,248,253,278,284,356,71,182,259,264,58,63,100,168,323,347,349,101,181,199,246,252,260,281,286,299,324,334,353,30,34,67,195,201,250,270,316,344,350,13,91,105,155,302,358,254,261,271,303,355,66,116,267,269,321,348,52,62,217,47,56,65,90,95,176,258,268,272,117,366,53,94,118,245,257,368,365,25,61,112,233,288,296,298,57,121,124,200,314,317,26,48,103,119,228,285,120,215,36,60,68,137,229,244,273,280,291,331,70,81,213,222,225,238,27,38,98,106,206,237,69,172,231,89,20,171,173,177,218,243,28,35,135,224,309,14,208,230,232,19,129,226,279,306,23,134,205,211,5,131,132,214,33,113,133,290,40,114,79,85,235,315,130,207,216,239,77,125,141,234,292,24,76,86,227,369,41,87,140,37,210,295,276,367,126,138,204,277,289,6,326,361,39,88,102,145,212,328,31,43,209,21,42,219,44,127,294,9,111,122,123,136,202,221,10,115,139,223,83,327,330,1,174,2,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,18,22,32,45,46,84,110,128,142,144,236,240,75,274,275,3,241,293,220,203,329,17,370,109,143],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-05-13","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"query": "<image><image><image><image>Context:\n\n12\nOven Vents\nThe oven vents release hot air and moisture from the ovens and \nshould not be blocked or covered. Blocking or covering the vents \nwill cause poor air circulation, affecting cooking and cleaning \nresults. Do not set plastics, paper, or other items that could melt \nor\u00a0burn near the oven vents.\nBaking and Roasting\nPreheating\nWhen beginning a Bake cycle, the oven will begin preheating \nafter Start is pressed. The oven will take approximately 12 \nto 15\u00a0minutes to reach 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) with all of the oven \nracks provided with your oven inside the oven cavity. Higher \ntemperatures will take longer to preheat. The preheat cycle rapidly \nincreases the oven temperature. The actual oven temperature \nwill go above your set temperature to offset the heat lost when \nyour oven door is opened to insert food. This ensures that when \nyou place your food in the oven, the oven will begin at the proper \ntemperature. Insert your food when the preheat tone sounds. \nDo\u00a0not open the door during preheat before the tone sounds.\nRapid Preheat\nRapid Preheat can be used to shorten the preheating time. Only \none standard flat oven rack should be in the oven during Rapid \nPreheat. Extra racks should be removed prior to starting Rapid \nPreheat. The preheating cycle should be completed before placing \nfood in the oven. When the Rapid Preheat cycle is complete, the \noven starts a normal Bake cycle.\nIMPORTANT: Rapid Preheat should be used only for single-rack \nbaking.\nOven Temperature\nWhile in use, the oven elements will cycle on and off as needed \nto maintain a consistent temperature, but they may run slightly \nhot or cool at any point in time due to this cycling. Opening the \noven door while in use will release the hot air and cool the oven \nwhich could impact the cooking time and performance. It is \nrecommended to use the oven light to monitor cooking progress.\nNOTE: On models with convection, the convection fan may run in \nthe non-convection Bake mode to improve oven performance.\nAccuBake\u00ae Temperature Management System\nThe AccuBake\u00ae Temperature Management System electronically \nregulates the oven heat levels during preheat and bake to maintain \na precise temperature range for optimal cooking results. The bake \nand broil elements or burners cycle on and off in intervals. On \nconvection range models, the fan will run while preheating and \nmay be cycled on and off for short intervals during bake to provide \nthe best results. This feature is automatically activated when the \noven is in use.\nBefore baking and roasting, position racks according to the \n\u201cPositioning Racks and Bakeware\u201d section. When roasting, it is \nnot necessary to wait for the oven preheat cycle to end before \nputting food in unless it is recommended in the recipe.\nFrozen Bake\u2122 Technology\nFrozen Bake\u2122 Technology can be used to cook prepackaged \nfrozen food without needing to preheat the oven and without \noverbrowning the food. There are 4 preprogrammed food options \nto choose from: Pizza, Lasagna, Nuggets/Fries, and Pie. Frozen \nBake\u2122 Technology should only be used for these foods. Cook \nonly 1 package at a time when using Frozen Bake\u2122 Technology. \nUse the recommended temperature and maximum recommended \ntime from the packaging.\nA beep will alert you to check the food\u2019s doneness before the \ncook time is completed and again at the end of the cook time. The \ndisplay will prompt you to add to the cook time or end the cycle.\nBroiling\nWhen broiling, preheat the oven for 5 minutes before putting food \nin unless recommended otherwise in the recipe. Leave the desired \noven door open 41/2\" (114 mm) at the broil stop position to ensure \nproper broiling temperature. Position food on grid in a broiler pan, \nand then place it in the center of the oven rack.\nNOTE: Odors and smoke are normal the first few times the oven \nis\u00a0used or if the oven is heavily soiled.\nChanging the temperature when broiling allows more precise \ncontrol when cooking. The lower the broil setting is, the slower the \ncooking. Thicker cuts and unevenly shaped pieces of meat, fish, \nand poultry may cook better at lower broil settings. Refer to the \n\u201cPositioning Racks and Bakeware\u201d section for more information.\nOn lower settings, the broil element will cycle on and off to \nmaintain the proper temperature.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFor best results, use a broiler pan and grid. It is designed to \ndrain juices and help avoid spatter and smoke.\nIf you would like to purchase a broiler pan, one may be \nordered. See the \u201cAccessories\u201d section.\nLower Oven Convection Cooking\nIn a convection oven, the fan-circulated hot air continually \ndistributes heat more evenly than the natural movement of air in a \nstandard thermal oven. This movement of hot air helps maintain a \nconsistent temperature throughout the oven, cooking foods more \nevenly, crisping surfaces while sealing in moisture, and yielding \ncrustier breads.\nIf the oven door is opened during convection cooking, the fan \nwill\u00a0turn off immediately. It will come back on when the oven \ndoor\u00a0is closed.\nNOTE: The oven door must be closed for convection broiling.\nPosition the racks according to the \u201cPositioning Racks and \nBakeware\u201d section before starting convection cooking.\nWith convection cooking, most foods can be cooked at a lower \ntemperature or for a shorter length of time.\nA\nB\nA.\t Upper oven vent\nB.\t Lower oven vent\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Where are the oven vents located on this range model, and why is their positioning important for proper oven function?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/2a85d3a79b7b5a635e1c8cee9419c3db.png", "data/qwen_images/cd1b9d6faa8d9e354f941c7994a005e8.png", "data/qwen_images/4d4b5922390f1f69358b7ff69b33c852.png", "data/qwen_images/282aaa3a35a85dcf72870cbd7f16e2e4.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\n \nis performed as of September 1st, and an assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair \nvalue of the asset below its carrying value.  The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment and concludes if it is more likely than not \nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value is less than \nthe carrying value, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.  If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the \nreporting unit is less than the carrying value, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is required.  Step one of the impairment assessment compares the fair value of the \nreporting unit to its carrying value and if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value \nof goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value exceeds the carrying value then goodwill is not impaired; otherwise, an impairment loss \nwould be recorded by the amount the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.  \nLeases\nAt the inception of a lease arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances \npresent in the arrangement.  Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as a right-of-use (ROU) assets and as short-term and long-term \nlease liabilities, as applicable.  The Company does not have any financing leases.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected \nremaining lease term.  The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable.  As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to \ndiscount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company believes it could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same \ncurrency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment.\nThe Company has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet.  The Company typically only includes an initial \nlease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement.  Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company\u2019s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the \nCompany will renew.\nIncome Taxes \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement \ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to \nbe recovered or settled.  The Company records a valuation allowance when it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that all of the future income tax benefits will not be realized.  When \nthe Company changes its determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized, the valuation allowance is adjusted with a corresponding impact \nto income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.  The ultimate realization of the Company\u2019s deferred income tax assets depends upon generating \nsufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company projects future levels of taxable income.  \nThis assessment requires significant judgment.  The Company examines the evidence related to the recent history of losses, the economic conditions in which the Company \noperates and forecasts and projections to make that determination.  \nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain \nthe position following an audit.  For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has \na greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.  Increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits could \nresult from management\u2019s belief that a position can or cannot be sustained upon examination based on subsequent information or potential lapse of the applicable statute of \nlimitation for certain tax positions.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  For fiscal 2023 and 2022 the Company had no uncertain \ntax provisions and therefore no material provisions for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nResearch, Development and Related Engineering Costs\nResearch, development and related engineering costs are expensed as incurred.\n52\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What criteria does the Company use to determine whether a lease arrangement should be recognized on the balance sheet, and how does it handle leases with an original term of one year or less?", "response": "", "images": []}

Specifically, the empty sequence is often the modal output, but conditioning on a desired length can yield\nbetter results. The length conditional modes are essentially always grammatical, unlike for the MT model where\nthey were often truncated for shorter target lengths. This is probably because we were able to condition on lengths\nthat were similar to the length of the actual reference continuations, which was not the case for our MT experiments.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time exact and conditional modes have been investigated for a language\nmodel, so this generalizes the prior findings of Stahlberg and Byrne (2019). A priori, we were worried that\nlength-conditional modes from GPT-2 might just be a single word repeated over and over, or a repetition of an\nearlier sentence from the context. The fact that they\u2019re high-quality even for this open-ended task is extremely\nencouraging.\n49\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the relationship between reference length percentile and the percentage of empty modes differ from the relationship between reference sentence length percentile and the probability of empty context?

Prompts are grouped by the decile of the length of the reference response.\nFigure 6.3 shows the same pattern happens with LLaMA as in the earlier experiments: Inputs with longer\nreference lengths have empty modes more often, but the probability of empty outputs either declines or is relatively\nunchanged with length. In Figure 6.3b, Alpaca is the only model that shows a clear trend in terms of empty\nprobability, but even it only changes by a factor of about 2/2\u22120.45 \u22483.\nAs mentioned in Chapter 5, it\u2019s commonly thought that the bad mode problem occurs when a task is less-\nconstrained (meaning there are many correct responses). We don\u2019t have access to multiple references, but we can\nestimate how spread the model\u2019s estimate of output distribution is, then see how that relates to mode emptiness.\nFigure 6.4 shows this relationship, by showing (for each prompt) the logprob of the mode, the average logprob\nover 5 samples10, and whether the modal output is empty.\nThe Alpaca and Guanaco modes support the \u201clevel-of-constraint\u201d hypothesis, with the empty modes only\noccurring when the estimate of the entropy is below some threshold. LLaMA, on the other hand, has empty modes\neven for prompts with fairly low entropies (high sample logprobs). Emitting an EOS token right away is an error for\nthe Alpaca and Guanaco training tasks (conversation/QA), but could actually be correct for the web data LLaMA\nwas trained on.\n6.5.3\nQualitative analysis: Which prompts lead to empty modes?\nInstruction-following is a much more varied task than either MT or story completion, in terms of how constrained\nthe set of responses is. In MT, we\u2019d expect that the entropy of the output roughly scales with the input length.\nWith instruction-following, it\u2019s easy to come up with short inputs that have extremely high output or extremely\nlow entropy.\nIn Chapter 5, we suggested that the bad mode problem shouldn\u2019t be thought of in terms of length, but in terms\nof the entropy of the set of valid outputs. This is often related to length, but can easily be decoupled from it. For\nexample, when prompted with \u201cRecite the Declaration of Independence.\u201d, Alpaca\u2019s global mode is the first 151\ntokens of the preamble, ending with \u201c...to effect their safety and happiness.\u201d On the other hand \u201cWrite a brief\nparagraph of the benefits of attending Arizona State University\u201d is assigned the empty mode. The latter prompt\nhas many valid outputs shorter than 151 tokens, but the entropy of those valid outputs is clearly far higher than the\nentropy of the set of valid responses to the recitation prompt.\nIn the previous section, we quantitatively looked at the relationship between open-endedness and empty modal\noutputs. Here, we also look at it quantitatively by giving more examples of prompts that lead to empty or non-\nempty outputs. Tables B.3, B.4, and B.5 show 10 of each for each of the three LLaMA-based models, which were\nrandomly sampled to avoid cherry-picking.\n10The average log-probability of a sample is just the entropy, so this is an estimate of the negative conditional entropy for a prompt. A lower\nvalue means that the model\u2019s distribution is more spread out for that prompt.\n51\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What trend does the blue line exhibit as the reference length percentile increases, and how does this compare to the trends shown by the other two lines?

A notable special case is GCN [122], in which AGGREGATE performs a\nweighted average followed by a non-linear activation function (e.g. ReLU).5 Other\naggregation operators are also viable, e.g. element-wise sum, max, or product (cf. [88,\n100]). We note that distinguishing self-loops from other edges, and more generally,\ntreating multiple edge types, is possible through the use of different weight matrices\nfor different edge types [88, 189]. For conciseness, we hereinafter focus on the case of\na single edge type, and treat multiple edge types in Appendix D.2.\nAfter L layers, the GNN generates hidden embeddings h(L,1), . . . , h(L,|V|) \u2208RDh. For\ngraph prediction, where a single output is produced for the whole graph, the hidden\nembeddings are usually combined into a single vector through the AGGREGATE\nfunction. A final linear layer with weights W(o) \u2208R1\u00d7Dh is then applied to the\nresulting vector.6 Overall, the function realized by a depth L graph prediction GNN\nreceives an input graph G with vertex features X := (x(1), . . . , x(|V|)) \u2208RDx\u00d7|V|, and\nreturns:\n(graph prediction)\nf (\u03b8,G)(X) := W(o)AGGREGATE\n\u0000\b\n\b\nh(L,i) : i \u2208V\n\t\n\t\u0001\n,\n(5.3)\nwith \u03b8 := (W(1), . . . , W(L), W(o)) denoting the network\u2019s learnable weights. For vertex\nprediction tasks, where the network produces an output for every t \u2208V, the final\nlinear layer is applied to each h(L,t) separately. That is, for a target vertex t \u2208V, the\nfunction realized by a depth L vertex prediction GNN is given by:\n(vertex prediction)\nf (\u03b8,G,t)(X) := W(o)h(L,t) .\n(5.4)\nOur aim is to investigate the ability of GNNs to model interactions between vertices.\nPrior studies of interactions modeled by different deep learning architectures have\nfocused on neural networks with polynomial non-linearity, building on their rep-\nresentation as tensor networks [51, 49, 53, 192, 132, 133, 16, 118, 134, 135, 215, 136].\nAlthough neural networks with polynomial non-linearity are less common in practice,\nthey have demonstrated competitive performance [47, 50, 193, 200, 46, 63, 100], and\nhold promise due to their compatibility with quantum computation [78, 25] and\nfully homomorphic encryption [72]. More importantly, their analyses brought forth\nnumerous insights that were demonstrated empirically and led to development of\npractical tools for widespread deep learning models (with non-linearities such as\nReLU).\nFollowing the above, in our theoretical analysis (Section 5.4) we consider GNNs with\n(element-wise) product aggregation, which are polynomial functions of their inputs.\nNamely, the AGGREGATE operator from Equations (5.2) and (5.3) is taken to be:\nAGGREGATE(X ) := \u2299x\u2208X x ,\n(5.5)\nwhere \u2299stands for the Hadamard product and X is a multiset of vectors. The\nresulting architecture can be viewed as a variant of the GNN proposed in [100],\nwhere it was shown to achieve competitive performance in practice. Central to\nour proofs are tensor network representations of GNNs with product aggregation\n5In GCN, AGGREGATE also has access to the degrees of vertices, which are used for computing the\naveraging weights. We omit the dependence on vertex degrees in our notation for conciseness.\n6We treat the case of output dimension one merely for the sake of presentation. Extension of our\ntheory (delivered in Section 5.4) to arbitrary output dimension is straightforward \u2014 the results hold as\nstated for each of the functions computing an output entry.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) influence the network's ability to model interactions between vertices, and what are the implications of using a product aggregation operator in this context?", "response": "", "images": []}

{"query": "Context:\n\nWe move on to the results for the six other datasets. Note that each figure also\ncontains the background dataset (gray dots) for reference. These results help to\nunderstand the differences between our statistical cultures.\nThe maximum approval score statistic provides insight into whether there is\na candidate that is universally supported. Instances with a value close to 1 pos-\nsess such a candidate. In a single-winner election, this candidate is likely to be a\nclear winner. This is undesirable when simulating, for example, contested elec-\ntions. Also note that in the real-world data set (Pabulib) we do not observe such\ncandidates.\nWhen looking at the PAV runtime, we find some statistical cultures that gener-\nate computationally difficult elections, such as, e.g., the (p, \u03d5)-resampling model\nwith parameter values close to p = 0.5 and \u03d5 = 1 (0.5-IC), the noise model with\nparameters p \u2208[0.5, 0.9] and \u03d5 > 0.5, and the disjoint model with g = 2. Yet,\ninstances from the real-world dataset, as well as from the Euclidean and urn ones,\ncan be computed very quickly.3\nConcerning voters in cohesive groups, whenever this statistic is close to 1, it is\neasy to satisfy most voters with at least one approved candidate in the committee;\nsuch committees are easy to find [Aziz et al., 2017]. Since many proportional\nrules take special care of voters who belong to cohesive groups, in such elections\nthere are no voters that are at a systematic disadvantage. In many of our generated\nelections (almost) all voters belong to 1-cohesive groups, but this is not the case\nfor the real-world, Pabulib data. Indeed, to simulate Pabulib data well, we would\nlikely need to provide some new statistical culture(s).\nFor the cohesiveness level, we see that all models generate a full spectrum\n(i.e., [0, 10]) of cohesiveness levels. However, we expect realistic elections to\nappear in the \u201clower left\u201d part of our grid (with few approvals), and such elections\ntend to have low cohesiveness levels. Indeed, this is also the case for the Pabulib\nelections. Hence, it is important how proportional rules treat \u2113-cohesive groups\nwith small \u2113.\n7.7.3\nCorrelation\nFigures 7.4 to 7.7 are based on the approvalwise distance. We argue that they\nwould not change much if we used the (computationally intractable) isomorphic\n3Less than 1 second on a single core (Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 CPU @ 2.70GH) of a 224 core\nmachine with 6TB RAM. In contrast, the worst-case instance (0.3-IC) required 25 minutes on 13\ncores.\n165\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How well do the statistical cultures described in the text capture the characteristics of real-world elections, and what implications does this have for the design and evaluation of proportional voting rules?", "response": "", "images": []}

(a) The geo-topological (GT)\ntransform is formulated as a linear piecewise function, such that any distances smaller than a lower\nbound l will be mapped to zero, and any distances bigger than an upper bound u will be mapped to\n1. Between l and u, the transition is linear. (b) By varying the thresholds l and u, we select among a\nfamily of GT transforms.

The closer a GT transform is to the upper left\ncorner (l = 0, u = max), the more similar the RGTM is to the RDM. As we approach the diagonal\nline (l = u), the GT transform approaches a hard threshold, emphasizing the topology rather than\nthe geometry.

Natural gas \nproduced by us is sold at various delivery points to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated \nmidstream companies. \nThe prices we receive are calculated based on various pipeline indices. When there is an \nopportunity to do so, we may have our natural gas processed at San Mateo\u2019s, Pronto\u2019s or third parties\u2019 processing \nfacilities to extract liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas.

Factors that, directly or \nindirectly, cause price fluctuations include, but are not limited to: the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand \nfor, oil, natural gas and NGLs; the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and certain \nother oil-exporting countries (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) and state-controlled oil companies; the prices and availability of competitors\u2019 \nsupplies of oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; the impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates; \ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts; \nthe availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing and transportation systems for oil, natural gas  \nand NGLs and gathering and disposal systems for produced water; the availability of refining capacity; the prices and \navailability of alternative fuel sources; weather conditions and natural disasters, including hurricanes and tropical \nstorms in the Gulf Coast region and severe cold weather in the Delaware Basin; political conditions or conflicts in or \naffecting oil and natural gas producing regions or countries, including the United States, the Middle East, South \nAmerica, Russia, Ukraine and China; the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and \n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Considering the factors outlined in Matador Resources Company's 2023 Annual Report that contribute to oil and natural gas price fluctuations, analyze how a hypothetical scenario involving a simultaneous surge in global demand for energy and a major geopolitical event disrupting a significant portion of global oil production would likely impact the company's profitability and overall financial strategy.", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/a223c72313d766c4237e9958c0967b4a.png"]}

Insight and \nengagement won\u2019t always lead to near-term outperformance, but we \nbelieve that in the fullness of time, it yields the best results for clients. \nIn private markets, several different dynamics are at play. \nMany private clients are making their first commitments to private \nmarkets\u2014perhaps driven by the potential for higher and/or less volatile \nreturns than public market counterparts or a recognition of the growing \nimportance of private companies in the global economy. During 2022, \nNeuberger Berman put itself at the forefront of efforts to democratize \nprivate markets with the launch of vehicles available to broader segments \nof the investing public across several jurisdictions. \nAmong institutional investors, the leading surveys reveal some definite \ntrends. While it\u2019s still the case that more investors say they expect to \nincrease their allocations than decrease them during 2023, there has been \na notable rise in the proportion planning to decrease exposures, or saying \nthey are above their allocation limits. The most commonly cited reason for \nslowing, stopping or reversing allocations is the \u201cdenominator effect\u201d, \nwhereby a decline in overall portfolio value, due mainly to re-pricing of \npublic-market assets, raises the proportion allocated to private markets. \nThe big exceptions to this trend of slowing allocations are private equity \nsecondaries and private debt, where many investors are initiating or adding \ninvestments, especially in direct lending and special situations. \nThe underlying picture is increasingly clear: investors are finding it difficult \nto commit to private markets just as many leading General Partners are \nseeking to raise new, larger funds; and while that will make for a tougher \nfundraising environment in the near term, it also creates abundant \nopportunity for liquidity providers. \nFor example, if funds end up smaller, there are likely to be more co-investment \nopportunities, and fewer Limited Partners able to take them on\u2014our team \nhas already seen an uptick in offers. Private equity secondaries has become \na buyer\u2019s market as both Limited Partners and General Partners seek \nliquidity to manage their portfolios. Over the summer of 2022, we held \nthe final close for our fifth NB Secondary Opportunities Fund, at $4.9bn. \nThe raise exceeded our target, reflecting strong investor appetite for both \ntraditional LP- and GP-led secondaries, and the expectation that secondary \ninvestors may benefit from an increasingly illiquid environment.

Rather than simply thresholding the distance matrix, which\nreplaces a geometrical summary with a topological summary, we explore transforms that can\nsuppress variations among small distances (which tend to be dominated by noise) and among large\ndistances (which may not reflect mutual information between the two variables), while preserving\ngeometrical information (which may boost sensitivity to simple relationships). We refer to these\ntransforms as geo-topological transforms, because they combine aspects of geometry and topology.\nDepending on the choice of the lower and upper bounds, these transforms can threshold (lower\nbound l = upper bound u) at arbitrary levels, adapting to the granularity of the dependency present\nin a data set. They can also, optionally, preserve geometrical information (lower bound l < upper\nbound u).\n70\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Which statistical test demonstrates the highest average statistical power for detecting sinusoidal relationships, and how does its performance compare to the test with the lowest average statistical power for the same relationship?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/4a04dc2b3137fa9d62f2ddda8bd16861.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\nRevenue that is recognized over time for the Company\u2019s three-piece products and equipment business is generally recognized \nusing the cost-to-cost input method as these products involve an intermediary step that results in customized work-in-process \ninventory.  For products that follow a point in time model, revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfer.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or \nproviding services.  Standalone selling prices for each performance obligation are generally stated in the contract.  When the \nCompany offers variable consideration in the form of volume rebates to customers, it estimates the most likely amount of \nrevenue to which it is expected to be entitled and includes the estimate in the transaction price, limited to the amount which is \nprobable will not result in reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the variable consideration is resolved.  When the \nCompany offers customers options to purchase additional product at discounted prices, judgment is required to determine if the \ndiscounted prices represent material rights.  If so, the transaction price allocated to the discount is based on its relative \nstandalone price and is recognized upon purchase of the additional product.  Customer payment terms are typically less than \none year and as such, the Company has applied the practical expedient to exclude consideration of significant financing \ncomponents from the determination of transaction price.\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.  Shipping and handling \nfees and costs from product sales are reported as cost of products sold and are accrued when the Company recognizes revenue \nover time before the shipping and handling activities occur.  Costs to obtain a contract are generally immaterial but the \nCompany has elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred if the duration of the contract is one year or less.\nUnbilled receivables are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control has passed \nto the customer but the customer has not yet been invoiced because the Company does not have present right to payment.  The \nCompany generally has a present right to payment when title of product transfers.  Unbilled receivables are included in \nreceivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding decrease to inventory.\nContract assets are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control for a \nperformance obligation has passed to the customer, but the right to invoice the customer is contingent upon the completion of \nthe performance obligations included in the contract.  Contract assets are classified as current as they are expected to be \ninvoiced within one year and may not exceed their net realizable value.  \nContract liabilities are established if the Company must defer the recognition of a portion of consideration received because it \nhas to satisfy a future obligation.  Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on when the Company \nexpects to recognize revenue.\nStock-Based Compensation. For awards with a service or market condition, compensation expense is recognized over the \nvesting period on a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are \nexpected to vest.  For awards with a performance condition, the Company assesses the probability of vesting at each reporting \nperiod and adjusts compensation cost based on its probability assessment.  The Company\u2019s plans provide for stock awards \nwhich may include accelerated vesting upon retirement, disability, or death of eligible employees. The Company considers a \nstock-based award to be vested when the service period is no longer contingent on the employee providing future service. \nAccordingly, the related compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals, or \nover the period from the grant date to the date that retirement eligibility is achieved if less than the stated vesting period.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with maturities of three \nmonths or less from the time of purchase and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short maturity of \nthose instruments. Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit are included in accounts payable.  The Company generally \nclassifies any cash that is legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage as restricted cash.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and \ndo not bear interest. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on past events, including historical experience, current \nconditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of accounts receivable.  \nInventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined under \nthe first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) or average cost method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment (\u201cPP&E\u201d) is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and \nincludes expenditures for new facilities and equipment and those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity \nof existing PP&E.

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\nIf C is the space of functions X \u00d7X \u2192R and X = R, then a simple and appropriate choice\nfor c is the Gaussian c(x) = exp(\u22121\n2\u21132\u27e8x, e\u22a5\u27e92) for some length scale \u2113> 0. Intuitively, this\nchoice for c measures the distance to the diagonal and decays based on that distance.\nProof. To prove Theorem 4.9, our approach will be to first rewrite (4.18) to have T(\u03c4,\u03c4) on\nboth sides. Once (4.18) is in this form, we will apply Theorem 4.8 with X \u00d7 X as the space\nof inputs. Recall that Theorem 4.8 generalises to higher-dimensional inputs.\nTo rewrite (4.17), we use a simple trick: duplicating the inputs. Let Ddbl be the collection of\ndata sets with inputs in Xdbl := X \u00d7 X and outputs in Y. The \u201cdbl\u201d in the subscript of Ddbl\nstands for \u201cdouble\u201d and serves to remind the reader that there are double the number of\ninputs. Let dup: D \u2192Ddbl be the function that maps a data set into Ddbl by duplicating the\ninputs. More precisely, for D = (x, y) \u2208DN,\ndup(D) = (((x1, x1), y1), . . . ((xN, xN), yN)).\n(4.20)\nIn (4.20), every input on the right-hand side has duplicated elements, so we say that such\ndata sets have duplicated inputs. Let Ddup \u228aDdbl be the subset of Ddbl with duplicated inputs.\nNote that Ddbl contains data sets with and without duplicated inputs. Let dup\u22121 : Ddup \u2192D\nbe right inverse of dup: dup\u22121 takes in a data set with duplicated inputs and recovers the\noriginal by deduplicating the inputs.\nWith these definitions, we can relate T\u03c4 : D \u2192D to T(\u03c4,\u03c4) : Ddbl \u2192Ddbl:\nT\u03c4 = dup\u22121 \u25e6T(\u03c4,\u03c4) \u25e6dup.\n(4.21)\nDefine \u03c0dup := \u03c0 \u25e6dup\u22121, and note that \u03c0dup : Ddup \u2192Z operates on data sets with\nduplicated inputs.

This increase was primarily driven by an\naccounting gain recognized on the deconsolidation of McEwen Copper of $222.2 million.

{"query": "Context:\n\nfor components with standard pin spacings of 2.54mm.\nPick and place component criteria: We evaluated the criteria under which LaserFactory\ncan pick and place components. First, components require a minimum flat surface area of\n3x3mm above the component\u2019s center of mass for the suction tip\u2019s 2.5mm diameter nozzle\nto form a good contact. We found this could be increased or decreased by increasing or\ndecreasing the diameter of the pick-and-place nozzle, respectively. Second, components must\nhave a mass smaller than 65g for the pump suction to lift them. This threshold allows lifting\nlarge components, such as an Arduino Mega micro-controller (37g). A stronger pump could\nfurther raise this threshold. Third, their height cannot exceed 27 mm, currently limited by\nthe maximum extension of the linear potentiometer used to assess picking height. Given these\nconstraints, LaserFactory can pick large, heavy components, such as typical 3V batteries;\ntall components such as rotors; and a variety of small components, such as SMD resistors\ndown to size 2010. For future work, these constraints can be further lifted by using a smaller\nnozzle, larger pump, and longer lead screw.\nUse over time: During the course of fabrication, the peak power draw measured from\nthe two on-board parallel 9V lithium ion batteries was 13.5W. Between no-load cases of\ncutting/folding and variable-load cases of PCB-making, this is sufficient for approximately\n4 hours of continuous device creation. We detected no irregularities in laser carriage motion\nthat would indicate undue stress on the laser cutter during use.\n3.2\nLaser sintering: Curing Circuit Traces using a CO2\nlaser\nWhen both the silver paste has been deposited and the components have been placed onto\na substrate in the laser cutter, the silver is not yet conductive, nor does it rigidly bond\ncomponents to the substrate. For this, the silver requires curing via heating, traditionally\nachieved via baking the created device in an oven before it becomes functional. However, this\nhas several drawbacks, such as that the heat in the oven can damage the material substrate\nand the electronic components due to the thermal stresses. To solve this issue, we developed\na technique that uses the laser to cure the circuit traces and connect components electrically.\nA benefit of using the laser is that it allows for a fully integrated fabrication process with no\nmanual work required. In addition, heat is only applied locally to traces and thus affects the\nmaterial sheet only in the locations of the trace. Finally, using the laser is fast, approximately\n5 minutes in contrast to the 2 hours achieved via uniform heating in an oven [15]. Once the\nlast circuit trace is cured, the device is functional right off the fabrication bed.\n3.2.1\nFabrication Settings for Laser Sintering\nWe ran a set of experiments to determine the best power, speed, and z-axis settings for\ncuring silver traces. For the experiments, we used a Universal Laser Systems ULS.PLS.150D\nlaser cutter equipped with a 2.0 inch lens. For the silver, we used the silver paste from\nSunChemical (C2180423D2), which has a composition of 56.69% 24K silver and 43.31% a\nblend of resin and solvents.\n43\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential improvements that could be made to the LaserFactory's pick-and-place system to enhance its capability to handle a wider range of components, and how might these improvements address the current limitations?", "response": "", "images": []}

Privacy amplification protocol against memory-\ntampering active adversaries. In the above, for an n-bit string x we define [x]i =\n(x1, x2, . . . , xi), [x]i:j = (xi+1, . . . , xj), and [x]j: = (xj+1, . . . , xn).\nThe above protocol obtains very short output compared to entropy of W, whereas\nideally we would like to obtain something close to entropy of W. If Alice and Bob\nhave access to uniform randomness, one can extend this protocol to output almost as\nmany bits as W\u2019s entropy (see Figure 4.2). After the execution of the [11] protocol\nwe have the additional guarantee (see proof of Theorem 6, point (b)) that if SA \u0338= \u22a5\nand SB \u0338= \u22a5then we know that SA = SB and are close to uniform and moreover\nEve did not tamper with W of either of the parties (this is only achieved with\nstandard notion of non-malleability, not the one from [105]). If Alice and Bob have\naccess to some extra uniform bits (if A and B were uniform to start with then we\ncould cut them in half A = A1 \u25e6A2 and B = B1 \u25e6B2, use the first half to run the\noriginal protocol by [11] and save the other half for later) then we can continue the\nprotocol (in the spirit of [79]): Alice will send A2, \u03c3A to Bob, where \u03c3A is a Message\nAutentication Code of A2 with first half of SA as a key. Bob will do the same: send\nB2, \u03c3B to Alice using other half of SB as a MAC key. There is a one final problem,\nwe know that one of A2 or B2 is uniform but we don\u2019t know which (Eve could have\nleft W unchanged but could have tampered with random coins A and B), moreover\none of them might depend on W. Notice that A2 and B2 will remain independent,\nand one of them is independent of W and uniform. Therefore A2 + B2 is uniform\nand independent of W. Now all we have to do is plug in W and A2 + B2 into seeded\nextractor SExt(W, A2 + B2) and we can extract almost whole entropy out of W\n(and the output remains hidden from the view of Eve).\n97\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Explain the role of the 2NMExt function in the privacy amplification protocol illustrated in Figure 4.1, and discuss how it ensures the security of the shared secret between Alice and Bob in the presence of an active adversary.", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/3e446ff3036f0c91c6945032ffa7998c.png"]}

These visually similar characters are\nnot required to be semantically equivalent or similar to the original\ncharacters. Usually, the candidates come from the alphabet of other\nlanguages. For example, users can replace \u201ca\u201d with \u201c\u00e5\u201d, \u201c\u00e4\u201d, \u201c\u0105\u201d, \u201c\u03b1\u201d,\netc. The candidates can also be punctuation or numbers, such as \u201c(\u201d\nfor \u201cC\u201d and \u201c1\u201d for \u201cl\u201d.

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of\ndrillships, semi-submersible rigs, and jackup rigs for operations in shallow to ultra-deepwater in both benign and harsh environments. We contract our drilling units to drill wells\nfor our customers on a dayrate basis. Our customers include oil super-majors, state-owned national oil companies, and independent oil and gas companies. In addition, we\nprovide management services to certain affiliated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned a total of 19 drilling rigs, of which 15 were operating (inclusive of three leased to the Gulfdrill joint venture and one leased to the Sonadrill\njoint venture), three were cold stacked and one was warm stacked. The 15 operating units include ten floaters (comprising seven 7th generation drillships and three 6th\ngeneration drillships), two harsh environment units (comprising one semi-submersible unit and one jackup) and three jackups. In addition to our owned assets, as of December\n31, 2023, we managed two rigs owned by Sonangol.\nWe are recognized for providing high quality operations, in some of the most challenging sectors of offshore drilling. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately\n2,500 employees across the globe. We are incorporated in Bermuda and have worldwide operations based on where activities are conducted in the global oil and gas industry.\n2) Our Fleet\nOur relatively modern fleet, amongst the youngest in the industry, is well positioned compared with other major offshore drillers. As of December 31, 2023, our owned fleet was\n19 drilling units which included ten drillships, four semi-submersible rigs and five jackup rigs. For additional information on our drilling units and newbuildings refer to Item 4D\n- \"Property, Plant and Equipment\".\nWe categorize the drilling units in our fleet as (i) floaters, (ii) jackups and (iii) harsh environment. This is further explained below.\na) Floaters\ni.\nDrillships:\nDrillships are self-propelled ships equipped for drilling offshore in water depths ranging from 1,000 to 12,000 feet and are positioned over the well through a computer-\ncontrolled thruster system. Drillships are suitable for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load-carrying capacity. Depending on the country of\noperation, drillships operate with crews of 120 to 160 people.\nii.\nSemi-submersible drilling rigs:\nSemi-submersibles consist of an upper working and living quarters deck connected to a lower hull consisting of columns and pontoons. Such rigs operate in a \"semi-submerged\"\nfloating position, in which the lower hull is below the waterline and the upper deck protrudes above the surface. The rig is situated over a wellhead location and remains stable\nfor drilling in the semi-submerged floating position, due in part to its wave transparency characteristics at the water line.\nSemi-submersible rigs can be either moored or dynamically positioned. Moored semi-submersible rigs are positioned over the wellhead location with anchors and typically\noperate in water depths ranging up to 1,500 feet. Dynamically positioned semi-submersible rigs are positioned over the wellhead location by a computer-controlled thruster\nsystem and typically operate in water depths ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 feet. Depending on the country of operation, semi-submersible rigs generally operate with crews of\n110 to 130 people.\n24\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What was the total capital expenditure for Seadrill in 2022, considering both the Successor and Predecessor periods?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/2229d5630fde8c400be8e5aa22ec9198.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\nChapter 1\nMargin-based complexity measures\nhave been proposed. These include theoretically proven bounds on the generalization error, such\nas Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension [6] and PAC-Bayesian bounds [7]. However, in the case\nof DNNs these bounds are generally not sufficiently tight to be practically useful [8]\u2013[10]. In\nfact, recent work [8] suggests that in the overparameterized setting, these bounds cannot be tight\nwithout making strong assumptions about the data distribution. A complementary approach\nto developing theoretical bounds is to develop empirical techniques that are able to predict\nthe generalization ability of certain families of DNN models. That is, techniques that are able\nto estimate or rank the generalization performance of a set of models using only the models\u2019\ntraining data and parameters.\nPredicting the generalization of a given model, or set of models, is important for several reasons:\n\u2022 An accurate measure of generalization could lead to a better theoretical understanding of\nthe mechanisms behind generalization in DNNs.\n\u2022 Such a measure could aid in model selection.\n\u2022 Should a measure be predictive of generalization, it could be possible to incorporate it\nin the training process, e.g. as a regularization term, which could further improve the\nperformance of DNNs.\n\u2022 In some settings, sufficient data is not available in order to estimate the generalization\nability of a model on a held-out dataset. Generalization prediction techniques can then be\nused to determine the model\u2019s performance.\nPredicting the generalization of DNNs is generally achieved through the use of a complexity\nmeasure, where a complexity measure is defined as some measurement of the network parameters\nor representations that correlates well with its generalization ability [9]. One class of complexity\nmeasures that has shown promise is that of margin-based measures.\n1.2\nMargin-based complexity measures\nMargin-based measures, as the name implies, rely on measuring margin: the shortest distance\nto the decision boundary from a training or test sample.

By focusing on cloud deployments, we are able to more rapidly and cost effectively deploy in our customers' environments, 83.6% of which by revenue were in the public cloud as of January 31, 2023. Our \nexpanding set of open APIs and ecosystem integrations enable us to add new sources of data for behavioral analysis and Collective Defense sharing and collaboration to detect and stop targeted cyber attacks.\nArmed with elite detection capabilities and combined offensive operator experience at the highest level of the U.S. government, our founders set out to build a behavioral analytics solution to detect threats heading toward, \nor already in, the network. A growing portfolio of proprietary analytics forms the backbone of IronDefense.\nHowever, while effective in detecting unknown anomalies, behavioral analytics by itself is insufficient in modern, noisy networks where anomalies are common and can lead to a high number of false positives. For many \nNDR vendors in the industry, the solution is to tune their analytics to be less sensitive in order to deliver reduced false-positive rates at the expense of letting true positives into the network. We undertook a different strategy \nto meet this challenge. We introduced our expert system scoring algorithms, supported by our elite cyber hunters, to increase IronDefense's detection specificity while preserving the sensitivity of its analytics.\nPowered by IronDefense\u2019s threat detections, IronDome, which we introduced in 2018, is the foundation of our Collective Defense platform, a purpose-built, cloud-native, and holistic platform that is capable of defending, \nanalyzing, and correlating threats from various sources. It delivers timely, actionable, and contextual insights to attacks targeting an enterprise and, from there, is able to provide early warning to all members of the \nCollective Defense ecosystem.\nThe differentiated value of our Collective Defense platform is its ability to build a dynamic, comprehensive picture of the threat environment, much like radar for cyberspace, based on real-time, anonymized alert correlation \nacross any participating member environments. It also provides situational context and peer insights for greater visibility and context of the threat landscape at any given time.\nIn August 2022, we announced our membership in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (\"JCDC\") and an agreement with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\"CISA\") to share information from our \nCollective Defense platform to help the agency defend against increased global cyber threats. In February 2023, we formalized a new public sector partnership establishing a communications channel between our threat \nanalysts and the DoD. The channel is intended to facilitate active collaboration of known and emerging threats, enabling us to inform the DoD of threat activity in near real time and vice versa. Through this public-private \npartnership, our anonymized IronDome data, in addition to our IronRadar visibility into key threat related C2 Server findings, is an important advancement of our collective defense mission.\nCorrelated alerts for threat detection earlier in the intrusion cycle\nWe are not aware of any other vendor in the market with a similar approach to cybersecurity. Even though community members bring disparate network environments, such as cloud, on-premise or hybrid, to the Collective \nDefense ecosystem, correlated threats stand out given that the adversarial behaviors are typically consistent, no matter who the target is.\nOur Collective Defense platform comprises two flagship products:\nIronDefense\nIronDefense is an advanced NDR solution that provides behavior-based and AI-driven analytics at the network level to detect anomalous activity at individual enterprises and prioritize the highest threats in a company\u2019s \nnetwork. We leverage novel AI/ML algorithms to deliver high-fidelity analytics required to detect previously unknown threats. In addition, we provide advanced enrichment techniques via IronDefense\u2019s Expert System, \nwhich has been designed to achieve high efficacy levels, low false positive rates, and improved visibility compared to legacy approaches. This is all done at network speed and cloud scale.\nMost current cybersecurity tools focus on detecting the final \u201caction-on-target\u201d step of an intrusion. At this stage, identification is easier but the insights come far too late to stop attackers from getting into positions in the \nnetwork to exfiltrate data, steal IP, or accomplish other malicious objectives. IronDefense uses advanced analytics based on metadata from the traffic in the customer\u2019s network to identify anomalous activity earlier in the \nintrusion kill chain.\nKey components of IronDefense include:\n10\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the \"New Approach\" described in the image fundamentally change the way organizations collaborate and share information about cyber threats compared to the \"Old Approach\"?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/bb41a10e6ad552e10d9bc9f763c383a9.png"]}

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements\nand notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report.\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,\nsee \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations\u201d in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOverview\nThe Company designs, manufactures, sells and services highly engineered drilling and production equipment for both offshore\nand onshore applications.\nThe Company\u2019s principal products consist of subsea and surface wellheads, specialty connectors and\nassociated pipes, subsea production systems, mudline hanger systems, production riser systems, dry tree systems, subsea manifolds, line\nhangers and expandable liner systems, multi-frac well connections, conventional wellhead, thermal wellhead, completion packers and\nsafety and kelly valves. Dril-Quip\u2019s products are used by major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies\nand drilling contractors throughout the world. Dril-Quip also provides technical advisory assistance on an as-requested basis during\ninstallation of its products, as well as rework and reconditioning services for customer-owned Dril-Quip products. In addition, Dril-\nQuip\u2019s customers may rent or purchase running tools from the Company for use in the installation and retrieval of the Company\u2019s\nproducts.\nThe Company\u2019s organizational structure is based on product and service lines. The Company operates in three business\nsegments\u2014 Subsea Products, Subsea Services, and Well Construction. Our Subsea Products business manufactures highly engineered,\nfield-proven products with a wide array of deepwater drilling equipment and technology that meets the requirements for harsh subsea\nenvironments. Our Subsea Services business provides high-level aftermarket support and technical services with field technicians that\nsupport the full installation and lifecycle management of regulatory and industry standards, as well as offering industry training\nprograms. Our Well Construction business provides products and services utilized in the construction of the wellbore such as\ncompletions, casing hardware and liner hanger systems. These products and services are used on both land and offshore markets.\nRecent Developments\nOn July 31, 2023, TIW Canada ULC (\u201cPurchaser\u201d), an unlimited liability company governed by the Laws of Alberta and wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Dril-Quip, acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of 1185641 B.C. Ltd. (d/b/a Great North\nWellhead and Frac), a corporation governed by the laws of the province of British Columbia (\u201cGreat North Wellhead\u201d), pursuant to a\ndefinitive agreement (the \u201cShare Purchase Agreement\u201d), dated as of July 31, 2023, among each of the shareholders of Great North\nWellhead (collectively, \u201cSellers\u201d), Industrial Growth Partners V AIV L.P., in its capacity as agent to Sellers thereunder, Purchaser and,\nsolely in its capacity as guarantor for the obligations of Purchaser thereunder, Dril-Quip for a cash purchase price of $105 million CAD,\napproximately $79.8 million. The purchase price is subject to customary purchase price adjustments and includes potential earnout\npayments of up to $30 million CAD, approximately $22.8 million, to be paid over the course of 2024 and 2025 if Great North Wellhead\nand its subsidiaries meet specific revenue growth targets.\nThe parties have made customary representations and warranties to each other. The Share Purchase Agreement also contains\ncustomary covenants.\nFor information with respect to this item, see \u201cBusiness Acquisitions,\u201d Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nBusiness Environment\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d). The\nInflation Reduction Act contains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% book-income corporate alternative\nminimum tax on any corporation that, along with the other members of its controlled group, if any, has average adjusted financial\nstatement income over $1.0 billion for any 3-tax-year period ending with January 1, 2022 or later and a 1% excise tax on the fair market\nvalue of stock that is repurchased by publicly traded U.S. corporations or their specified affiliates. The alternative minimum tax and the\nexcise tax are effective in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. Currently, we are not subject to the corporate alternative\nminimum tax. The Company will evaluate any impact related to the excise tax on stock repurchases by the Company in future periods.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Dril-Quip entered into a collaboration agreement with Aker Solutions ASA (Aker Solutions) to\noffer subsea injection systems for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) projects. Under the agreement, Dril-Quip will provide\nAker Solutions with CO2 injection Xmas trees and wellheads that will be fully integrated into a larger subsea injection system to provide\ncustomers with market-leading technology purposely designed for the injection and storage of CO2. The arrangement will leverage on\nAker Solution\u2019s position as an integrated supplier of CCUS systems along with its control systems and electrification components. We\nbelieve this collaboration agreement focuses on the strengths of both organizations, will deliver an optimum solution for carbon capture\nand storage, and is in line with each party\u2019s strategic goals of collaboration and partnerships to unlock value for customers.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How might the geopolitical factors discussed in the \"Business Environment\" section impact Dril-Quip's future strategic decisions and partnerships, particularly in the context of its CCUS collaboration?", "response": "", "images": []}

Furthermore, our average tracking error is 43% lower\nthan CEM on the same benchmark. For Benchmark 2 and Benchmark\n3, our optimizer\u2019s success rates are 20% and 45% higher than CEM, re-\nspectively. Similarly, our tracking error remains lower than CEM on these\nbenchmarks.\nNotably, the CEM method generally deploys less accelera-\ntion on average compared to our proposed method. This arises from our\nmethod\u2019s dual focus on minimizing acceleration and addressing the need to\nnavigate obstacles while following the desired trajectory. In more challeng-\ning scenarios, our method may utilize more acceleration to yield feasible\ntrajectories, contributing to a higher success rate.\nComputation Time Scaling:\nFigure 28 visually presents the per-\niteration computation time scaling of our batch optimizer for varying num-\nbers of circles and obstacles. Notably, the plot indicates a (sub)linear scaling\nof per-iteration computation time in relation to the number of circles and\nobstacles. This trend can be attributed to the matrix algebra employed in\nour optimizer. Specifically, a linear increase in the number of footprint cir-\ncles or obstacles leads to a similar increase in the number of rows of matrices\nF and gi, while the number of columns remains constant. Consequently, the\ncomputation cost of obtaining FT gi in (5.19) can be made approximately\nlinear through suitable GPU parallelization. Also, the matrices FT F need\nto be computed only once since they remain constant across iterations and\nbatches. A similar linear complexity analysis applies to the solutions of\n(5.14) as well, where solutions are available as symbolic formulae, ensuring\nlinear complexity concerning the variables nc and no.\nAdditionally, I assess the per-iteration computation time of our vector-\nized batch optimizer across GPUs and multi-threaded CPUs in Table. 4.\n66\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Given the data in Table 2, what is the likely impact on tracking error and acceleration if the batch size is further increased beyond 1000, and why?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/968bab2b854b3aca6b4ac181ce5f13cc.png", "data/qwen_images/043d4ad9cb962536e2261faabc98d6f4.png"]}

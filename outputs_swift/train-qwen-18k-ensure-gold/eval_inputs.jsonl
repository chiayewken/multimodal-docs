Blocking or covering the vents \nwill cause poor air circulation, affecting cooking and cleaning \nresults. Do not set plastics, paper, or other items that could melt \nor\u00a0burn near the oven vents.\nBaking and Roasting\nPreheating\nWhen beginning a Bake cycle, the oven will begin preheating \nafter Start is pressed. The oven will take approximately 12 \nto 15\u00a0minutes to reach 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) with all of the oven \nracks provided with your oven inside the oven cavity. Higher \ntemperatures will take longer to preheat. The preheat cycle rapidly \nincreases the oven temperature. The actual oven temperature \nwill go above your set temperature to offset the heat lost when \nyour oven door is opened to insert food. This ensures that when \nyou place your food in the oven, the oven will begin at the proper \ntemperature. Insert your food when the preheat tone sounds. \nDo\u00a0not open the door during preheat before the tone sounds.\nRapid Preheat\nRapid Preheat can be used to shorten the preheating time. Only \none standard flat oven rack should be in the oven during Rapid \nPreheat. Extra racks should be removed prior to starting Rapid \nPreheat. The preheating cycle should be completed before placing \nfood in the oven. When the Rapid Preheat cycle is complete, the \noven starts a normal Bake cycle.\nIMPORTANT: Rapid Preheat should be used only for single-rack \nbaking.\nOven Temperature\nWhile in use, the oven elements will cycle on and off as needed \nto maintain a consistent temperature, but they may run slightly \nhot or cool at any point in time due to this cycling. Opening the \noven door while in use will release the hot air and cool the oven \nwhich could impact the cooking time and performance. It is \nrecommended to use the oven light to monitor cooking progress.\nNOTE: On models with convection, the convection fan may run in \nthe non-convection Bake mode to improve oven performance.\nAccuBake\u00ae Temperature Management System\nThe AccuBake\u00ae Temperature Management System electronically \nregulates the oven heat levels during preheat and bake to maintain \na precise temperature range for optimal cooking results. The bake \nand broil elements or burners cycle on and off in intervals. On \nconvection range models, the fan will run while preheating and \nmay be cycled on and off for short intervals during bake to provide \nthe best results. This feature is automatically activated when the \noven is in use.\nBefore baking and roasting, position racks according to the \n\u201cPositioning Racks and Bakeware\u201d section. When roasting, it is \nnot necessary to wait for the oven preheat cycle to end before \nputting food in unless it is recommended in the recipe.\nFrozen Bake\u2122 Technology\nFrozen Bake\u2122 Technology can be used to cook prepackaged \nfrozen food without needing to preheat the oven and without \noverbrowning the food. There are 4 preprogrammed food options \nto choose from: Pizza, Lasagna, Nuggets/Fries, and Pie. Frozen \nBake\u2122 Technology should only be used for these foods. Cook \nonly 1 package at a time when using Frozen Bake\u2122 Technology. \nUse the recommended temperature and maximum recommended \ntime from the packaging.\nA beep will alert you to check the food\u2019s doneness before the \ncook time is completed and again at the end of the cook time. The \ndisplay will prompt you to add to the cook time or end the cycle.\nBroiling\nWhen broiling, preheat the oven for 5 minutes before putting food \nin unless recommended otherwise in the recipe. Leave the desired \noven door open 41/2\" (114 mm) at the broil stop position to ensure \nproper broiling temperature. Position food on grid in a broiler pan, \nand then place it in the center of the oven rack.\nNOTE: Odors and smoke are normal the first few times the oven \nis\u00a0used or if the oven is heavily soiled.\nChanging the temperature when broiling allows more precise \ncontrol when cooking. The lower the broil setting is, the slower the \ncooking. Thicker cuts and unevenly shaped pieces of meat, fish, \nand poultry may cook better at lower broil settings. Refer to the \n\u201cPositioning Racks and Bakeware\u201d section for more information.\nOn lower settings, the broil element will cycle on and off to \nmaintain the proper temperature.\n\u25a0\n\u25a0\nFor best results, use a broiler pan and grid. It is designed to \ndrain juices and help avoid spatter and smoke.\nIf you would like to purchase a broiler pan, one may be \nordered. See the \u201cAccessories\u201d section.\nLower Oven Convection Cooking\nIn a convection oven, the fan-circulated hot air continually \ndistributes heat more evenly than the natural movement of air in a \nstandard thermal oven. This movement of hot air helps maintain a \nconsistent temperature throughout the oven, cooking foods more \nevenly, crisping surfaces while sealing in moisture, and yielding \ncrustier breads.\nIf the oven door is opened during convection cooking, the fan \nwill\u00a0turn off immediately. It will come back on when the oven \ndoor\u00a0is closed.\nNOTE: The oven door must be closed for convection broiling.\nPosition the racks according to the \u201cPositioning Racks and \nBakeware\u201d section before starting convection cooking.\nWith convection cooking, most foods can be cooked at a lower \ntemperature or for a shorter length of time.\nA\nB\nA.\t Upper oven vent\nB.\t Lower oven vent\n\n\n22\nIMPORTANTES INSTRUCTIONS DE S\u00c9CURIT\u00c9\nCONSERVEZ CES INSTRUCTIONS\nI  Nettoyer la table de cuisson avec prudence \u2013 Si une \n\u00e9ponge ou un chiffon mouill\u00e9 est utilis\u00e9 pour essuyer les \nrenversements sur une surface de cuisson chaude, \u00e9viter \nles br\u00fblures caus\u00e9es par la vapeur chaude.

Distinct from the data manifold that exists in\ninput space as the object along which all data are embedded, the signal manifold is\nthe surface along with the data are embedded according to the model. OOD detection\nand signal manifold dimension estimation begin to showcase the advantages of path\nkernel ensemble representations of neural networks. This was joint work primarily\nperformed by Brian Bell, Michael Geyer, where most of the theoretical work and\nmathematics was derived and written by Brian Bell and the experimental work and\nnumerical results were produced by Michael Geyer. This particular paper includes\nan extensive literature review (performed by Brian Bell) analyzing some methods\nthat have recently come to occupy the cutting-edge of OOD detection algorithms.\nIn the context of this dissertation, this paper includes two important contributions,\none is a cleaner general definition of the representation from the previous paper. The\nother is the decomposition of predictions by taking gradients of this representation\nwith respect to various spaces. This second contribution allows the application of\nthis theory to a class of recent work and demonstrates the ability of this theoretical\nfoundation to inform practical applications at the cutting edge.\n\n\n120\nChapter 5. Exact Path Kernels Naturally Decompose Model Predictions\n5.1\nIntroduction\nOut-of-distribution (OOD) detection for machine learning models is a new, quickly\ngrowing field important to both reliability and robustness (Hendrycks and Dietterich,\n2019; Biggio et al., 2014; Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2017; Silva et al., 2023; Yang\net al., 2021; Filos et al., 2020). Recent results have empirically shown that parameter\ngradients are highly informative for OOD detection (Behpour et al., 2023; Djurisic\net al., 2023a; Huang, Geng, and Li, 2021a). To our knowledge, this paper is the\nfirst to present theoretical justifications which explain the surprising effectiveness of\nparameter gradients for OOD detection.\nIn this paper, we unite empirical insights in cutting edge OOD with recent\ntheoretical development in the representation of finite neural network models with\ntangent kernels (Bell et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021b; Domingos, 2020b). Both of\nthese bodies of work share approaches for decomposing model predictions in terms\nof parameter gradients. However, the Exact Path Kernel (EPK) (Bell et al., 2023)\nprovides not only rigorous theoretical foundation for the use of this method for\nOOD, but also naturally defines other decompositions which deepen and expand\nour understanding of model predictions. The application of this theory is directly\nconnected to recent state of the art OOD detection methods.\nIn addition, this paper provides a connection between tangent kernel methods\nand dimension estimation. At the core of this technique is the ability to extract\nindividual training point sensitivities on test predictions and use these to map the\nsubspace on which parameter gradients can vary, the parameter tangent space. This\npaper demonstrates a generalization (the gEPK) of the EPK from Bell et al. (2023).\nGiven a training point xtrain, the final parameter state \u03b8 of a model f, and a test\n\n\n130\nChapter 5. Exact Path Kernels Naturally Decompose Model Predictions\nhave a matrix of size number of classes by number of parameters.:\n1\nC\nC\nX\ni\n\u2202LCE(f(x; \u03b8), i)\n\u2202\u02c6\ny\n\u2207\u03b8f(x; \u03b8)\n(5.19)\nThis looks like the left side of the inner product from the gEPK, however the scaling\nfactor, \u2202LCE(f(x; \u03b8), i)\n\u2202\u02c6\ny\n, does not match. In fact, this approach is averaging across\nthe parameter gradients of this test point with respect to each of its class outputs,\nwhich we can see is only a related subset of the full basis used by the model for\npredictions. This explains improvements made in later methods that are using a more\nfull basis. Another similar method, ExGrad (Igoe et al., 2022), has been proposed\nwhich experiments with different similar decompositions and raises some questions\nabout what is special about gradients in OOD \u2013 we hope our result sheds some light\non these questions. Another comparable method proposed by Sun et al. (2022) may\nalso be equivalent through the connection we establish below in Section 5.1 between\nthis decomposition and input gradients which may relate with mapping data manifolds\nin the Voronoi/Delaunay (Gillette and Kur, 2022) sense.\nReAct, DICE, ASH, and VRA Along with other recent work (Sun, Guo, and Li,\n2021; Sun and Li, 2022; Xu et al., 2023a), some of the cutting edge for OOD as of early\n2023 involves activation truncation techniques like that neatly described by Djurisic\net al. (2023b). Given a model, f(x; \u03b8) = fclassify(\u00b7; \u03b8classify) \u25e6frepresent(\u00b7; \u03b8represent) \u25e6\nfextract(\u00b7; \u03b8extract), and an input, x, a prediction, f(x; \u03b8), is computed forward through\nthe network. This yields a vector of activations (intermediate model layer outputs),\nA(x; \u03b8represent), in the representation layer of the network. This representation is then\npruned down to the pth percentile by setting any activations below that percentile to\nzero. Djurisic et al. (2023b) mention that their algorithm, Activation SHaping (ASH),\n\n\n5.4. OOD is enabled by Parameter Gradients\n131\nFigure 5.3: Explained Variance Ratio of parameter gradients. Left:\nMNIST, Right: CIFAR. 95% of variation can be explained with a\nrelatively low number of components in both cases.\ndoes not depend on statistics from the training data. However by chain rule, high\nactivations will correspond with high parameter gradients. Meaning this truncation is\npicking a representation for which\n*\n\u2207\u03b8f(x; \u03b8represent), \u2202L( \u02c6\ny(xi), yi)\n\u2202\u02c6\ny\n\u2207\u03b8f(xi; \u03b8represent)\n+\n(5.20)\nis high for many training points, xi. We note that the general kernel representation\ndefined in Section 5.3 can be computed for any subset of a composition. Truncation is\neffectively a projection onto the gradients on parameters with the highest variation\nin the representation layers of the network. This may explain some part of the\nperformance advantage of these methods.\nGradOrth Behpour et al. (2023) explicitly create a reference basis from parameter\ngradients on training data for comparison. They do this for only the last layer of a\nnetwork with mean squared error (MSE) loss, allowing a nicely abbreviated expression\n\n\n5.4. OOD is enabled by Parameter Gradients\n133\ntraining step which will span most of the variation in models\u2019 learned adjustments.\nTheorem 5.4.1 and the definition of SVD provide the following:\nCorollary 5.4.2. Let A be a matrix stacking the elements of B as rows. Then let\nU\u03a3V T = A as in SVD. Then Span(B) = Span(Rows(V )).\nIn the case that the number of training data exceed the number of parameters\nof a model, the same result holds true for a basis computed only for gradients with\nrespect to the final parameter states \u03b8S. We will use a truncation, V \u2032 of this final\ntraining gradient basis which we examine in Fig. 5.3. This truncation still explains\nmost variation in all layers due to the convergence of training gradients to a smaller\nsubspace as shown in Fig. 5.2. In future it may be possible to argue statistical\nexpectations about the performance of a sketching approach to producing an equally\nperformant basis without expensive SVD.\nWe can see that most, if not all, of the above OOD methods can be represented\nby some set of averaging or truncation assumptions on the basis V . These should be\nmostly caught by the truncated basis V . We test the usefulness of V \u2032 to perform OOD\ndetection by projection onto its span using a sum over the class outputs weighted\nby the loss gradients L\u2032(f(xi; \u03b8S), yi) in Fig. 5.2. As the purpose of this paper is\nnot to develop state of the art OOD detection methods, a comparison with recent\nbenchmarks is not provided. Instead, a proof of concept that the gEPK can perform\nOOD detection is given. We note that this scalling has only been extracted from\nthe final training step, however this assumption is supported by the convergence of\nthis scaling over training. The gEPK helps explain the high performance of gradient\nbased methods due to the implicit inclusion of the training parameter space in model\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How do the activation truncation techniques like ASH leverage parameter gradients to enhance OOD detection, and what is the underlying principle that explains their performance advantage?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/c9dddf7ae0a259839689d1bccd1c5884.png", "data/qwen_images/47c2f6d82f6842792b9768d4972e8830.png"]}

Depress the accelerator gradu-\nally after releasing the service brakes.\n\n\nDriving your vehicle\n46\n5\nSpecial driving conditions\nSpecial driving conditions\nIf driving conditions deteriorate due to \npoor weather or road conditions, you \nshould pay even more attention than \nusual to your driving.\nHazardous driving conditions\nWhen hazardous driving conditions are \nencountered such as water, snow, ice, \nmud, sand, or similar hazards, follow \nthese suggestions:\n\u50c5Drive cautiously and allow extra dis-\ntance for braking.\n\u50c5Avoid sudden braking or steering.\n\u50c5Do not pump the brake pedal on a \nvehicle equipped with ABS.\n\u50c5If stalled in snow, mud, or sand, use \nthe second gear. Accelerate slowly to \navoid spinning the drive wheels.\n\u50c5Use sand, rock salt, or other nonslip \nmaterial under the drive wheels to \nprovide traction when stalled in ice, \nsnow, or mud.\nReducing the risk of a rollover\nThis multipurpose passenger vehicle is \ndefined as a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). \nUtility vehicles have a significantly \nhigher rollover rate than other types of \nvehicles. SUVs have higher ground \nclearance and a narrower track to make \nthem capable of performing in a wide \nvariety of offroad applications.\nSpecific design characteristics give them \na higher centre of gravity than ordinary \nvehicles. An advantage of the higher \nground clearance is a better view of the \nroad, which allows you to anticipate \nproblems.\nThey are not designed for cornering at \nthe same speeds as conventional pas-\nsenger vehicles, any more than low-\nslung sports vehicles are designed to \nperform satisfactorily in off-road condi-\ntions. Due to this risk, driver and passen-\ngers are strongly recommended to \nbuckle their seat belts.\nIn a rollover crash, an unbelted person is \nsignificantly more likely to die than a \nperson wearing a seat belt. There are \nsteps that a driver can make to reduce \nthe risk of a rollover.\nIf at all possible, avoid sharp turns or \nabrupt manoeuvres, do not load your \nroof rack with heavy cargo, and never \nmodify your vehicle in any way.\nWARNING\nRollover\nAs with other Sports Utility Vehicle \n(SUV), failure to operate this vehicle cor-\nrectly may result in loss of control, an \naccident or vehicle rollover.\n\u50c5Utility vehicles have a significantly \nhigher rollover rate than other types \nof vehicles.\n\u50c5Specific design characteristics (higher \nground clearance, narrower track, \netc.) give this vehicle a higher centre \nof gravity than ordinary vehicles.\n\u50c5An SUV is not designed for cornering \nat the same speeds as conventional \nvehicles.\n\u50c5Avoid sharp turns or abrupt \nmanoeuvres.\n\u50c5In a rollover crash, an unbelted person \nis significantly more likely to die than \na person wearing a seat belt.

The \ncompact spare tyre diameter is \nsmaller than the diameter of a con-\nventional tyre and reduces the ground \nclearance approximately 2.5 cm (1 \ninch), which could result in damage to \nthe vehicle.\n\u50c5Do not take the vehicle through an \nautomatic car wash whilst the com-\npact spare tyre is installed.\n\u50c5Do not use tyre chains on the tempo-\nrary compact tyre. Because of the \nsmaller size, a tyre chain will not fit \nproperly. This could damage the vehi-\ncle and result in loss of the chain.\n\u50c5Temporary compact tyre should not \nbe installed on the front axle if the \nvehicle must be driven in snow or on \nice.\n\u50c5Do not use the temporary compact \ntyre on any other vehicle because this \ntyre has been designed especially for \nyour vehicle.\n\u50c5The temporary compact tyre tread life \nis shorter than a regular tyre. Inspect \nyour temporary compact tyre regu-\nlarly and replace worn compact spare \ntyres with the same size and design, \nmounted on the same wheel.\n\u50c5The temporary compact tyre should \nnot be used on any other wheels, nor \nshould standard tyres, snow tyres, \nwheel covers or trim rings be used \nwith the temporary compact spare \nwheel. If such use is attempted, dam-\nage to these items or other car com-\nponents may occur.\n\u50c5Do not use more than one temporary \ncompact tyre at a time.\n\u50c5Do not tow a trailer whilst the tempo-\nrary compact tyre is installed.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/b185898ff917b82f4b81ec07beb4ba22.png", "data/qwen_images/afc9a49a4e34a14a2847317f25d8fb3b.png", "data/qwen_images/bfa9b8107536f7fa34912616001b7f47.png", "data/qwen_images/82b0fb6fb75b7763c169434080c36a00.png", "data/qwen_images/9347e02ad79351a4268da716fd0206db.png", "data/qwen_images/4faa04265fc0962d69c47002d7d8a49b.png", "data/qwen_images/cc93789106525c9ce2f5495dd6e29aac.png"]}

Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue\nto be recognized.\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented\nseparately from the other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The liabilities of a disposal group\nclassified as held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group classified non-current assets and liabilities corresponding to the Chilean companies as\nheld for sale due to the divestment process that was agreed to in December 2023 and which closed in January 2024. See Note\n36.1.\n2.18 Financial assets\nFinancial assets are divided into the following categories: amortized cost; financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nand fair value through other comprehensive income. The classification depends on the Group\u2019s business model for managing\nthe financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when\nits business model for managing those assets changes.\nAll financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value, plus transaction costs.\nTransaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss, if any, are expensed to profit or loss.\nDerecognition of financial assets occurs when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire or are transferred\nand substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. An assessment for impairment is undertaken at\neach balance sheet date.\nInterest and other cash flows resulting from holding financial assets are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income\nwhen receivable, regardless of how the related carrying amount of financial assets is measured.\nAmortized cost are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active\nmarket. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date.\nThese are classified as non-current assets. These financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash\nequivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or\nservices directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivables. These financial assets are subsequently measured at\namortized cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment, if applicable.\nAny change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. All of the Group\u2019s financial assets are classified as amortized cost.\n2.19 Other financial assets\nNon-current other financial assets include contributions made for environmental obligations according to a Colombian and\nBrazilian government request and are restricted for those purposes.\nCurrent other financial assets include short-term investments with original maturities up to twelve months and over three\nmonths.\n2.20 Impairment of financial assets\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments. The impairment\nmethodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade\n\n\nTable of Contents\nF-27\nThe Group does not currently face interest rate risk on its US$ 500,000,000 Notes which carry a fixed rate coupon of 5.50%\nper annum and mature in January 2027. Consequently, the accruals and interest payments are not substantially affected by\nchanges in prevailing interest rates.\nAs of December\u00a031,\u00a02023, there were no outstanding borrowings affected by a variable rate.\nCapital risk\nThe Group\u2019s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern in order to\nprovide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the\ncost of capital. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions,\noperating risks and working capital requirements. To maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Group may issue or buy back\nshares, change its dividend policy, raise or refinance debt and/or adjust its capital expenditures to manage its operating and\ngrowth objectives. Additionally, the Group utilizes a planning, budgeting and forecasting process to help determine and\nmonitor the funds needed to maintain appropriate liquidity for operational, capital and financial needs.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, GeoPark is in compliance with the debt covenant ratios associated with the Company\u00b4s\nNotes due 2027.

It requires significant judgements and decisions based on available\ngeological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The estimation of economically recoverable oil and natural\ngas reserves and related future net cash flows was performed based on the Reserve Report as of December 31, 2023,\nprepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton Corp., an independent international oil and gas consulting firm based in\nDallas, Texas, in line with the principles contained in the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and the Petroleum\nResources Management Reporting System (PRMS) framework.\nIt incorporates many factors and assumptions including:\no\nexpected reservoir characteristics based on geological, geophysical and engineering assessments;\no\nfuture production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities;\no\nfuture oil and gas prices and quality differentials;\no\nassumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;\no\ntax rates by jurisdiction; and\no\nfuture development and operating costs.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nF-45\nMovements on the Group provision for impairment are as follows:\nAmounts in US$ '000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\nAt January 1\n14\n7\nAdditions\n\u2014\n10\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n4\n(3)\n18\n14\nNote 23\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inventories\nAmounts in US$ '000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\nCrude oil\n9,441\n12,630\nMaterials and spares\n4,111\n1,804\n13,552\n14,434\nThe carrying amount of inventories is not pledged as security for liabilities.\nNote 24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trade receivables\nAmounts in US$ '000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\nTrade receivables\n65,049\n71,794\n65,049\n71,794\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, there are no balances that were aged by more than 3 months.

{"query": "Context:\n\n \nproperty build out, equipment purchases, obligations under the Patent Technology License Agreement with Duke University and software enhancements with cash-on-hand, \ncash flows from future operations, the Company\u2019s revolving line of credit (see Note 4) and potential additional debt financing. The Company intends to transfer  the assets \nrelated to the Patent and Technology License Agreement with Duke University and certain other assets into a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary to provide more financial \nflexibility to fund future projects.  Once such transfer is completed, the Company also intends to explore spinning off this subsidiary to the Company\u2019s shareholders.\nThe Company anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash flows from future operations, together with external sources of capital \nwill be sufficient to fund its known cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Cash flows from operations will depend primarily upon increasing revenues from sales of its \numbilical cord blood and cord tissue cellular storage services, developing its infusion services at the Cryo-Cell Institute for Cellular Therapies and managing discretionary \nexpenses.  If expected increases in revenues are not realized, or if expenses are higher than anticipated, or if the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, the Company \nwill be required to reduce or defer cash expenditures or otherwise manage its cash resources during the next 12 months so that they are sufficient to meet the Company\u2019s cash \nneeds for that period.  Any reductions in expenditures, if necessary, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business operations, including sales activities and the \ndevelopment of new services and technology.  In the future, the Company anticipates using a substantial amount of cash to fund clinical trials related to the Patent and \nTechnology License Agreement with Duke University (see Note 18) and to develop its biopharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities related to mesenchymal stromal cells \nderived from umbilical cord tissue.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States \nrequires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in \nthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  The SEC has defined a company\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the \nportrayal of the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of \nthe need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, \nactual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions.  We have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and \nestimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  For further discussion of the Company\u2019s significant and critical accounting policies, refer to Note 1 \u2013 \n\u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Critical and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this document.\nRevenue Recognition \nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC \n606\u201d). ASC 606 applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements \nand financial instruments. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas, such as the accounting for costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASC 606 also requires disclosure of the \nnature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, the Company is required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs consisting primarily of commissions paid when contracts are \nsigned and amortize these costs on a systematic basis, consistent with the pattern of transfer of the storage services provided over time for which the asset relates. \nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when, or as, obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised services are \ntransferred to the customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to a customer \n(\"transaction price\").\nAt contract inception, if the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company evaluates its contracts with customers using the five-step \nmodel: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price \nto separate performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company evaluates its contracts for legal \nenforceability at contract inception and subsequently throughout the Company\u2019s relationship with its customers. If legal enforceability with regards to the rights and obligations \nexist for \n32\n\n\n \n\u2022Public cord blood banking\n\u2022License and royalties\n\u2022Sale of PrepaCyte CB product\na)Collection, Processing and Storage Fees \nProcessing and storage fees include the Company providing umbilical cord blood and tissue cellular processing and cryogenic cellular storage for private use. \nRevenues recognized for the cellular processing and cryogenic cellular storage represent sales of the umbilical cord blood stem cells program to customers and income from \nlicensees who are selling the umbilical cord blood stem cells program to customers outside the United States. \nThe Company recognizes revenue from processing fees at the point in time of the successful completion of processing and recognizes storage fees over time, \nwhich is ratably over the contractual storage period as well as other income from royalties paid by licensees related to long-term storage contracts which the Company has \nunder license agreements.  Contracted storage periods are typically annual, eighteen years, twenty-one years and lifetime. The life-time storage plan is based on a life \nexpectancy of 81 years, which is the current estimate by the Center for Disease Control for United States women\u2019s life expectancy and concluded that additional data \nanalysis would result in an immaterial difference in revenue.  Deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets includes the portion of the annual, the \ntwenty-one-year and the life-time storage fees that are being recognized over the contractual storage period as well as royalties received from foreign licensees relating to \nlong-term storage contracts for which the Company has future obligations under the license agreement. The Company classifies deferred revenue as current if the Company \nexpects to recognize the related revenue over the next 12 months from the balance sheet date.\nSignificant financing\nWhen determining the transaction price of a contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after \nperformance, resulting in a significant financing component. For all plans being annual, twenty-one years and lifetime, the storage fee is paid at the beginning of the storage \nperiod (prepaid plans). Alternatively, the Company offers payment plans (including a stated service fee) for customers to pay over time for a period of one to twenty-four \nplus months.  The one-time plan includes the collection kit, processing and testing, return medical courier service and twenty-one years of pre-paid storage fees.  The life-\ntime plan includes the collection kit, processing and testing, return medical courier service and pre-paid storage fees for the life of the customer. The Company concluded \nthat a significant financing component is not present within either the prepaid or overtime payment plans. The Company has determined that the twenty-one year and life-\ntime prepayment options do not include a significant financing component as the payment terms were structured primarily for reasons other than the provision of financing \nand to maximize profitability.  \nThe Company has determined that the majority of plans that are paid over time are paid in less than a year.  When considered over a twenty-four-month payment \nplan, the difference between the cash selling price and the consideration paid is nominal. As such, the Company believes that its payment plans do not include significant \nfinancing components as they are not significant in the aggregate when considered in the context of all contracts entered into nor significant at the individual contract level.\nThe Company elected to apply the practical expedient where the Company does not need to assess whether a significant financing component exists if the period \nbetween when it performs its obligations under the contract and when the customer pays is one year or less.\nAs of November 30, 2023, the total aggregate transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations was recorded as deferred revenue amounting \nto $50,891,353, which will be recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the contractual period of which $9,704,553 will be recognized over the next twelve months.\nVariable consideration\nIn December 2005, the Company began providing its customers that enrolled after December 2005 a payment warranty under which the Company agrees to pay \n$50,000 to its client if the umbilical cord blood product retrieved is used for a stem cell transplant for the donor or an immediate family member and fails to engraft, subject \nto various restrictions.  Effective February 1, 2012, the Company increased the $50,000 payment warranty to a $75,000 payment warranty to all of its new clients.  Effective \nJune 1, 2017, the Company increased the payment warranty to $100,000 to all new clients who choose the premium processing method, PrepaCyte CB.  The product \nwarranty is available to \n47\n\n\n \nis performed as of September 1st, and an assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair \nvalue of the asset below its carrying value.  The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment and concludes if it is more likely than not \nthat the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value is less than \nthe carrying value, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.  If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the \nreporting unit is less than the carrying value, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is required.  Step one of the impairment assessment compares the fair value of the \nreporting unit to its carrying value and if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value \nof goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value exceeds the carrying value then goodwill is not impaired; otherwise, an impairment loss \nwould be recorded by the amount the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value.  \nLeases\nAt the inception of a lease arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances \npresent in the arrangement.  Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as a right-of-use (ROU) assets and as short-term and long-term \nlease liabilities, as applicable.  The Company does not have any financing leases.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected \nremaining lease term.  The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable.  As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to \ndiscount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company believes it could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same \ncurrency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment.\nThe Company has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet.  The Company typically only includes an initial \nlease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement.  Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company\u2019s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the \nCompany will renew.\nIncome Taxes \nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement \ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to \nbe recovered or settled.  The Company records a valuation allowance when it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that all of the future income tax benefits will not be realized.  When \nthe Company changes its determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized, the valuation allowance is adjusted with a corresponding impact \nto income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.  The ultimate realization of the Company\u2019s deferred income tax assets depends upon generating \nsufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes.  In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company projects future levels of taxable income.  \nThis assessment requires significant judgment.  The Company examines the evidence related to the recent history of losses, the economic conditions in which the Company \noperates and forecasts and projections to make that determination.  \nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain \nthe position following an audit.  For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has \na greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.  Increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits could \nresult from management\u2019s belief that a position can or cannot be sustained upon examination based on subsequent information or potential lapse of the applicable statute of \nlimitation for certain tax positions.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  For fiscal 2023 and 2022 the Company had no uncertain \ntax provisions and therefore no material provisions for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nResearch, Development and Related Engineering Costs\nResearch, development and related engineering costs are expensed as incurred.\n52\n\n\n \nrecognized over the requisite service period, regardless if the market condition will be met.  The exercise price of the options is $4.30 and the calculated fair value of the \noptions is $1.76.  These stock options vest immediately when the price of the Company's stock reaches $8.00 per share during the five-year option term.  As of November 30, \n2023 and November 30, 2022, the Company recognized approximately $80,000 and $0, respectively, in compensation cost and is reflected as selling, general and \nadministrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. As of November 30, 2023, there was approximately $52,000 of unrecognized compensation \ncost to be recognized over the remaining requisite service period of 0.61 years.\n \nNOTE 11 - LICENSE AGREEMENTS\nThe Company enters into two types of licensing agreements and in both types, the Company earns revenue on the initial license fees.  Under the technology \nagreements, the Company earns processing and storage royalties from the affiliates that process in their own facility.  Under the marketing agreements, the Company earns \nprocessing and storage revenues from affiliates that store specimens in the Company's facility in Oldsmar, Florida.\nTechnology Agreements\nThe Company has entered into a definitive License and Royalty Agreement with LifeCell International Private Limited, formerly Asia Cryo-Cell Private Limited, \n(\u201cLifeCell\u201d) to establish and market its umbilical cord blood and menstrual stem cell programs in India.\nPer the License and Royalty Agreement with LifeCell, there was a $1,000,000 cap on the amount of royalty due to the Company per year and a $10,000,000 cap \non the amount of royalties due to the Company for the term of the License and Royalty Agreement. Since inception of the License and Royalty Agreement, the Company has \nrecorded approximately $10,000,000 in royalty income due under the terms of the License and Royalty Agreement.   LifeCell has paid the Company in full as of  November \n30, 2023 and November 30, 2022.  \n \nMarketing Agreements\nThe Company has definitive license agreements to market the Company's umbilical cord blood stem cell programs in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, \nNicaragua, Panama and Pakistan. \n  \nNOTE 12 \u2013 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has employment agreements in place for certain members of management.  These employment agreements which include severance arrangements, \nare for periods ranging from one to two years and contain certain provisions for severance payments in the event of termination or change of control.\nLeases\nThe Company entered into a ten-year lease in April 2004 for its 17,600-square foot cGMP/cGTP compliant corporate headquarters in Oldsmar, Florida. This \nfacility contains the Company\u2019s executive offices, its conference and training center, its laboratory processing and cryogenic storage facility and its scientific offices.  In July \n2018, the Company extended the main lease through December 31, 2021 for the 17,600 square foot space.  On January 11, 2021, the Company extended the main lease \nthrough December 31, 2024 for the 17,600 square foot space.  On May 2, 2023, the Company extended this lease through December 31, 2026.\nThe Company entered into a one-year lease in November 2013 for an additional 800 square feet of office space in Miami, Florida for annual rent of approximately \n$38,000.  The lease commenced during December 2013.  In December 2016, the Company extended the lease through December 31, 2019.  In April 2021, the Company \nextended the lease through April 30, 2023.\nThe Company entered into a one-year lease in July 2023 for an additional 800 square feet of office space in Miami, Florida for annual rent of approximately \n$48,000. The lease commenced during July 2023. \n66\n\n\n \nshare of net storage revenues originating in the state of Texas to a maximum of 33,000 storage spaces.  During fiscal 2008, Red Rock assigned 50% of their interest in the \nagreement to SCC Investments, Inc., an Arizona corporation.  During fiscal year 2010, SCC Investments, Inc. assigned its interest to SCF Holdings, LLC, an Arizona limited \nliability company.  During fiscal 2016, 50% of the RSA for the state of Texas was repurchased by the Company.\nThe Company made total payments to all RSA holders of $1,009,813 and $970,037 for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2023 and November 30, 2022 \nrespectively, exclusive of termination and repurchase payments. The Company recorded an RSA accrual of $1,076,411 and $1,005,598 as of November 30, 2023 and \nNovember 30, 2022, respectively, related to interest owed to the RSA holders, which is included in accrued expenses. The Company also recorded interest expense of \n$1,077,967 and $1,092,370 for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is reflected in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated \nstatements of operations.\n \nNOTE 15 \u2013 SHARE REPURCHASE PLAN\nIn December 2011, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorized management at its discretion to repurchase up to one million (1,000,000) shares of the \nCompany's outstanding common stock.

Specifically,\nthe node uses back pointers to go back up the search tree until some node that has a full KV-cache is found. This\nway, a greedy search path out to depth k will only require O(k) memory instead of O(k2).\nIn summary, when search node at depth k is evaluated, a k \u00d7 d key/value cache2 h1:k is produced It is then\nprocessed as follows:\n1. The search node saves the vector hk\n2. The full cache h1:k is passed to the first child node, which uses it for a forward pass then frees it\n3. If a second child node will be expanded, the search node recomputes the full cache h1:k using its cached\nvector and those cached in its ancestors. This time the cache is saved for use in the third, fourth, etc. child\ninstead of being freed after the second child uses it.\nThis heuristic isn\u2019t optimal by any means, but it lets us avoid running out of memory when the search state gets\nhundreds of nodes deep. Some potentially better methods include using a LRU cache that limits the number of full\ncaches in memory, or using the next-token probabilities at each node to make a smarter decision about whether a\nfull or partial cache should be kept.\n6.3\nExact modes of an MT model\nIn this section, we use DFS to find the exact modes of the pretrained Chinese-English MarianMT model (Tiede-\nmann and Thottingal, 2020) on the WMT\u201917 Zh-En newsdev dataset (Bojar et al., 2017). The model is a standard\ntransformer using the architecture of Vaswani et al. (2017). Just like Stahlberg and Byrne (2019), we find that the\nmodel\u2019s mode is often empty, and that this occurs more often as the length of the source sentence increases. In\naddition to replicating their results, we also qualitatively examine the modal outputs to see if the the empty modes\nwere just hiding further degeneracies (e.g., disfluency or repetition).\nOne important thing to note about this model is that it was trained with 10% label smoothing. This means\nthat the model is trained with a (token-wise) 90-10 mixture distribution of actual translations and the uniform\ndistribution on its vocabulary. This mixture distribution puts a hard upper bound on how long the modal output\ncan be (See Liang et al. (2022)), but Riley and Chiang (2022) found that adding label smoothing didn\u2019t tend to\nchange the length or repetition bias in beam search, so this level of label smoothing might be too small to change\nthe actual modal sequence.\n6.3.1\nUnconditional modes\nAs expected, we find that the MarianMT Zh-En model predicts that the empty sequence as the mode for 57.7% of\nthe 2002 source sentences.3 Figure 6.1 shows the relationship between the length of the input sentence and empty\n2The KV-cache is actually a list of a key and value cache for each layer, so the size-d dimension should be seen as a concatenation of all\nthese different values.\n3For reference, Stahlberg and Byrne (2019) found that 51.8% of inputs on the WMT news-test-2015 En-De dataset had an empty\nmode under their model.\n46\n\n\nConditional modes when the mode is empty.\nExamples K-T in Table B.1 show length-conditional modes for\nsome sources for which the model predicts the empty sequence as the modal output. Interestingly, the mode of\nlength 12 is grammatical for 8 of the 10 sources (all but N and S). There is no repetition, the most commonly\nobserved other search degeneracy in beam search.6.\nThe main cause of ungrammatical outputs seems to be the prescribed length being too short for all the infor-\nmation in the source sentence. The reason we\u2019re stuck with this problem is that the sentences that tend to have\nempty model modes have reference lengths too long for us to do exact search for. Language modeling tasks have\nhigher entropy than MT, so we\u2019ll see empty modes at much shorter output lengths when we look at LMs in the\nnext section.\n6.3.3\nDiscussion: Exact modes in machine translation\nRunning exact search on the Marian MT Zh-En model replicated Stahlberg and Byrne (2019)\u2019s finding that the\nunconditional mode is often empty. On the other hand, length-conditional modes seem to generally be high quality.\nThe other \u201cdegeneracy\u201d we see in the conditional modes is that they may be truncated when the conditioning is too\nshort. That seems to be mostly due to the fact that we have to condition on lengths much shorter than the reference\ntranslations.7\nOverall, we consider these findings an encouraging sign, since we didn\u2019t see repetition or disfluency in the\nconditional modes. This supports our suggestion in Chapter 5 that finding the conditional argmax of a probability\ndistribution might avoid the bad mode problem.\n6.4\nExact modes of a cloze completion LM\nThe issue with looking at length-conditional modes of NMT models is that their output entropy rate is relatively\nlow. That makes it so that by the time outputs get long enough for degenerate modes to occur, they\u2019re also too long\nfor length-conditional search to be practical.\nTo move to a more open-ended setting that also has outputs of tractable lengths, we used the ROC stories\ndataset (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016). ROC Stories is a dataset of 5 sentence stories, where the goal is to predict\nthe last sentence based on the first 4. The intended way to evaluate models is to have them choose between\ntwo alternatives, but we just used it as a language modeling dataset since it has a very constrained format. We\nfinetuned8 the 345M parameter GPT-2 model (Radford et al., 2019a) on the dataset and searched for unconditional\nand length-conditional completions on the validation set. We used early stopping based on validation set perplexity\nover the 12 epoch training run.9\n6.4.1\nUnconditional modes\nThe empty sequence was the mode for 28.71% of the 1571 \u201cWinter 2018\u201d validation set stories. Figure 6.2 shows\nthat, unlike the NMT case, there\u2019s not a clear correlation between length and the probability of the mode being\nempty. This is probably just due to the fact that the output lengths don\u2019t vary much.\nThe probability of the empty sequence averages to around 4 or 5 in ten thousand, which is quite a bit higher\nthan in our MT experiments. Since the ROC stories data is much cleaner than MT training data, this definitely\nrepresents model error. The reason for it is likely just that finetuning didn\u2019t completely overwrite the base GPT-2\nmodels\u2019 distribution of when EOT should be emitted.\n6.4.2\nLength-conditional modes\nJust like with the MT model, the GPT-2 model\u2019s length-conditional modes are high-quality, even when its global\nmode is not. Table 6.2 shows one example of this behavior. The mode is empty, but the length conditional modes\nare all plausible completions of the story, and don\u2019t display any degeneracies such as repeating earlier text from\nthe story.\n6Repetition is locally super high probability: If the model outputs \u201ccat\u201d 20 times, the event that it is output a 21st time is extremely high\nprobability. The issue is that at some point the model has to output the EOS token, which is getting lower and lower in probability the more\ntimes the repetition happens. This makes it so that repetition can trap methods like beam search that need to make local decisions, but it doesn\u2019t\nactually give high-scoring full sequences.\n7In the next chapter when we look at approximate search for conditional modes, we\u2019ll instead be able to condition on the length being equal\nto the reference length, which will fix that problem.\n8Hyperparameters: Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125, and a batch size of 32.\n9This technically leaks information since we also look at modes on the validation set itself. However, we\u2019re just selecting between 12\nmodels (1 after each epoch), which means there aren\u2019t very many bits of leakage.\n48\n\n\n(a) Percent of stories that have the empty sequence\nas their modal continuation.\n(b) Geometric mean of the model\u2019s probability of the empty\nsequence given the first four sentences of the story.\nFigure 6.2: Finetuned GPT-2-345M predictions of empty outputs on the ROC Stories validation set (1571 Stories).\nStories are grouped into 5 equally sized bins by reference continuation length.\nTable 6.2: Modal continuations of several lengths for prefix: \u201cSarah always had a fascination with the night sky.\nNoticing her passion, Sarah\u2019s father bought her a new telescope. She was ecstatic. She went outside every night to\ndiligently view the night sky.\u201d The reference continuation is \u201cSarah loved her new telescope.\u201d\nLength Constraint (tokens)\nLog-probability\nText\nGlobal mode\n-7.79\n<|endoftext|>\n5\n-9.14\nSarah loved astronomy!<|endoftext|>\n6\n-7.97\nSarah never looked back.<|endoftext|>\n7\n-8.59\nSarah loved her new telescope.<|endoftext|>\n8\n-9.38\nNow, Sarah is an astronomer.<|endoftext|>\n9\n-8.68\nSarah was happy with her new telescope.<|endoftext|>\n10\n-8.77\nSarah was very happy with her new telescope.<|endoftext|>\n12\n-8.91\nSarah was amazed by the beauty of the night sky.<|endoftext|>\nAn interesting feature of these constrained modes is that the content can be correlated with the length in clear\nways. Table 6.3 shows an example where the mode of length 5 is significantly different from all the other modes.\nIt may be impossible to produce a 5 token output that has the right content, but the model \u201cprefers\u201d to output\nsomething grammatical, so we see different content. This is different from the short NMT modes, which were\noften truncated when the constraint was too short to express the content of the source sentence.\nIn order to show that these patterns aren\u2019t just cherry-picked, randomly sampled examples of modal outputs\nare shown in Table B.2. All 30 of the conditional modes are grammatical, relevant to the context, and don\u2019t show\nany evidence of degenerate behavior. This is further evidence that conditional MAP inference may be a promising\ndirection of investigation.\n6.4.3\nDiscussion: Exact modes for cloze completion\nOur findings for this finetuned GPT-2-medium model were essentially the same as what we found for the MT\nmodel. Specifically, the empty sequence is often the modal output, but conditioning on a desired length can yield\nbetter results. The length conditional modes are essentially always grammatical, unlike for the MT model where\nthey were often truncated for shorter target lengths. This is probably because we were able to condition on lengths\nthat were similar to the length of the actual reference continuations, which was not the case for our MT experiments.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time exact and conditional modes have been investigated for a language\nmodel, so this generalizes the prior findings of Stahlberg and Byrne (2019). A priori, we were worried that\nlength-conditional modes from GPT-2 might just be a single word repeated over and over, or a repetition of an\nearlier sentence from the context. The fact that they\u2019re high-quality even for this open-ended task is extremely\nencouraging.\n49\n\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\nReference length percentile\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n% of examples\n(a) Percent of prompts for which each model\u2019s modal re-\nsponse is the empty sequence.\n20\n40\n60\n80\nReference length percentile\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nNormalized log2 P(empty)\nModel\nLLaMA\nAlpaca\nGuanaco\n(b)\nDifference\nbetween\nthe\naverage\nbase-2\nlog-\nprobability of the empty sequence for a particular\nreference length decile, and the average over all ref-\nerence lengths. This relative view is to put all the log\nprobabilities in the same range, see Table 6.4 for the\nabsolute values.\nFigure 6.3: LLaMA 7B, Alpaca 7B, and Guanaco 7B predictions of empty outputs on 1000 prompts from the\ndatabricks-dolly-15k dataset. Prompts are grouped by the decile of the length of the reference response.\nFigure 6.3 shows the same pattern happens with LLaMA as in the earlier experiments: Inputs with longer\nreference lengths have empty modes more often, but the probability of empty outputs either declines or is relatively\nunchanged with length. In Figure 6.3b, Alpaca is the only model that shows a clear trend in terms of empty\nprobability, but even it only changes by a factor of about 2/2\u22120.45 \u22483.\nAs mentioned in Chapter 5, it\u2019s commonly thought that the bad mode problem occurs when a task is less-\nconstrained (meaning there are many correct responses). We don\u2019t have access to multiple references, but we can\nestimate how spread the model\u2019s estimate of output distribution is, then see how that relates to mode emptiness.\nFigure 6.4 shows this relationship, by showing (for each prompt) the logprob of the mode, the average logprob\nover 5 samples10, and whether the modal output is empty.\nThe Alpaca and Guanaco modes support the \u201clevel-of-constraint\u201d hypothesis, with the empty modes only\noccurring when the estimate of the entropy is below some threshold. LLaMA, on the other hand, has empty modes\neven for prompts with fairly low entropies (high sample logprobs). Emitting an EOS token right away is an error for\nthe Alpaca and Guanaco training tasks (conversation/QA), but could actually be correct for the web data LLaMA\nwas trained on.\n6.5.3\nQualitative analysis: Which prompts lead to empty modes?\nInstruction-following is a much more varied task than either MT or story completion, in terms of how constrained\nthe set of responses is. In MT, we\u2019d expect that the entropy of the output roughly scales with the input length.\nWith instruction-following, it\u2019s easy to come up with short inputs that have extremely high output or extremely\nlow entropy.\nIn Chapter 5, we suggested that the bad mode problem shouldn\u2019t be thought of in terms of length, but in terms\nof the entropy of the set of valid outputs. This is often related to length, but can easily be decoupled from it. For\nexample, when prompted with \u201cRecite the Declaration of Independence.\u201d, Alpaca\u2019s global mode is the first 151\ntokens of the preamble, ending with \u201c...to effect their safety and happiness.\u201d On the other hand \u201cWrite a brief\nparagraph of the benefits of attending Arizona State University\u201d is assigned the empty mode. The latter prompt\nhas many valid outputs shorter than 151 tokens, but the entropy of those valid outputs is clearly far higher than the\nentropy of the set of valid responses to the recitation prompt.\nIn the previous section, we quantitatively looked at the relationship between open-endedness and empty modal\noutputs. Here, we also look at it quantitatively by giving more examples of prompts that lead to empty or non-\nempty outputs. Tables B.3, B.4, and B.5 show 10 of each for each of the three LLaMA-based models, which were\nrandomly sampled to avoid cherry-picking.\n10The average log-probability of a sample is just the entropy, so this is an estimate of the negative conditional entropy for a prompt. A lower\nvalue means that the model\u2019s distribution is more spread out for that prompt.\n51\n\n\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\nT\narget length / reference length\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n% of sentences\nBest logprob\nConditional < Unconditional\nConditional = Unconditional\nConditional > Unconditional\n(a) Beam size 5.\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\nT\narget length / reference length\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n% of sentences\nBest logprob\nConditional < Unconditional\nConditional = Unconditional\nConditional > Unconditional\n(b) Beam size 20.\nFigure 7.2: A comparison of classifier-guided conditional beam search and beam search when generating outputs\nthat must be a certain length, using our finetuned GPT-2-345M model on the ROC Stories dev. set. See Figure 7.1\nfor explanation.\nof the corresponding reference length. For MT, the source/reference pairs come from the WMT17 dev set. For the\nROC Stories LM, the inputs are the first four sentences of examples from the dev set, and the references are the\ncorrect fifth sentence.\nOverall, conditional beam search outperforms unconditional beam search in terms of finding high-likelihood\nsequences satisfying the length constraint. The closest unconditional beam search comes to being better is at a\nlength ratio of 1.2 on ROC Stories with a beam size of 20, where conditional beam search only finds the better out-\nput about 1 percentage point as often. Unsurprisingly, there is less of a gap between unconditional and conditional\nsearch with a beam size of 20.10\nOne interesting difference between the MT results (Figure 7.1) and LM results (Figure 7.2) is that the relation-\nship between improvement and length is inverted. For a beam size of 5, unconditional search beats conditional\nsearch more often at higher lengths for MT, but less often at higher lengths for ROC stories. A priori we might\nhave expected a trend more like the one shown in Figure 7.1b, where the benefit of conditional search is the lowest\nat exactly the reference length, but higher for \u201cweirder\u201d lengths which aren\u2019t equal to the reference.\nQualitative properties of outputs\nA consistent pattern in the outputs is that conditional beam search finds grammatical outputs of the requested\nlength, while unconditional beam search does not. Tables 7.2 and 7.3 show several examples of this issue.11 While\nconditional beam search finds different outputs for each length such that the final length is correct, unconditional\nbeam search often outputs truncated sequences.\nThe reason that unconditional beam search is failing is that it can\u2019t plan ahead. If the target length is L, ordinary\nbeam search might have no examples on the beam at step L\u22122 that could lead to a fluent ending within two tokens.\nThe generation models do \u201cknow\u201d that it\u2019s the wrong time to output EOS, so they assign a low-probability to the\noverall sequence, but that isn\u2019t sufficient to find a good output if there aren\u2019t any good partial hypotheses on the\nbeam. This also partially explains why conditional beam search is able to find higher scoring sequences than\nunconditional beam search.\n7.5\nExperiments: Control of completeness and relevance with LLaMA\nIn the last section, we looked at training classifiers to control output length. This at least directly address the\nempty-mode problem, but is not of much practical interest. However, as we saw in Chapter 6, the 7B parameter\nLLaMA Touvron et al. (2023a) and its derivatives12 suffer from problems other than brevity. Some of the problems\nthat exact modes of LLaMA-7B on the instruction-following data displayed were:\n1. The mode was empty 70.7% of the time;\n10If the beam size is increased sufficiently, both methods will eventually find the conditional mode of length L.\n11To avoid cherry-picking, many more randomly selected outputs are shown in Tables D.1 and D.2, that also consistently show the same\npattern.\n12No pun intended.\n62\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the relationship between reference length percentile and the percentage of empty modes differ from the relationship between reference sentence length percentile and the probability of empty context?

All predictions\nexcept the first two have maximal con-\ntext.\n(c) Intermediate degree of overlap.\nExcept the first prediction, all predic-\ntions attend to at least 2 tokens of con-\ntext.\nFigure 2.3: Varying degree of overlap while evaluating a transformer with a window size of 3. The green (top)\ncircles are outputs, and the blue (bottom) circles are inputs.\n2.3.1\nPotential misalignment between LM evaluation and application\nTransformers are often described as having quadratic time complexity in comparison to RNNs which have linear\ntime complexity. However, this can be somewhat misleading when it comes to evaluation of perplexity. Given a\ntest set of length N, an RNN requires O(N) time to evaluate\u2014but reaching the best perplexity for a transformer\nrequires O(NT 2), where T is its maximum context size. (These time complexities exclude hidden state size,\nnumber of layers, and batch size.) This much higher time complexity is due to the fact that a transformer may\nbe run with its full context size once for each token in the test set, so that the maximum context is available for\neach prediction. Re-execution of the whole model for each token is required for models with absolute position\nembeddings, since hidden state reuse is only possible up to the maximum context size of the network. Note that it\nis possible to achieve smaller wall-clock time by splitting evaluation of a test set over multiple GPUs, but this is\nnot applicable to the generation setting where outputs depend on prior ones.\nTo illustrate why re-computation is necessary, consider executing GPT-2 (which has 1024 position embeddings)\non a test set. Each of the first 1024 tokens of a test set will have been passed into the network using a distinct\nposition embedding. Having exhausted the position embeddings, one option is to start again with the 1025th token\nbeing treated as position 1\u2014we will refer to this as disjoint execution, illustrated in Figure 2.3a. The issue with\ndisjoint execution is that it requires predicting the tokens at the beginning of a window from a very small amount\nof context.\nThe alternative, which is used for standard test set evaluation, is overlapped execution, as shown in Figure 2.3b.\nThe position embeddings are advanced by one position for each prediction, meaning that T \u22121 tokens are repeated\nbetween consecutive evaluations of the transformer, requiring much more computation. The benefit of this method\nis that it allows a model with T position embeddings to have T tokens of context for each prediction, as opposed\nto a variable amount between 1 and T.\nStepping a transformer decoder forward one token at a time measures the best that such a model could perform,\nbut it reflects a generative story that does not align with how the models may be used in practice. A perplexity that\nonly measures the ability of GPT-2 to generate the 1024th token given a context of 1023 tokens is not necessarily\nindicative of the model\u2019s performance when generating from a smaller context. For example, the popular website\nTalk To Transformer1 generates samples from GPT-2, but only provides 150 tokens of output. The evaluation of\nGPT-2 by stepping forward one token at a time provides little information about the quality of such generations.\nAn example where the discrepancy is length instead of brevity is the GPT backed text adventure game AI\nDungeon.2 In this setting, the number of tokens can easily reach and exceed the full context size GPT-2 was\ntrained on. Using overlapped execution as described above, generating each token would be 1024 times slower\nthan with disjoint execution, so perplexity calculated by overlapped execution does not match this use case either.\nWhile lower perplexity seems to correspond to better generation with shorter contexts in practice (perhaps due\nto parameter sharing between all sequence positions), there is no reason that this need be the case in principle. To\ndemonstrate an extreme case of the concern being discussed, let F be a transformer model with vocabulary V ,\nwhich uses the previous 1023 tokens as context, and consider the following generative story for generating token\nti:\nti \u223c\n(\nUniform(V )\nif i \u22641023\nF(t(i\u22121023):(i\u22121))\notherwise\nClearly the above generative model would not be of any practical use for generation or otherwise. However,\nbecause perplexity is calculated per token, increasing the size of the test set will lead to a measured perplexity that\n1https://talktotransformer.com/\n2https://aidungeon.io/.

For instance, we see in Table 2.3 a context discussing geography and rivers, followed\nby a continuation maintaining the same topic, and we see a context discussing the topic of payment, leading to a\nmention of money in the continuation. Beyond passing of topical information, another success case in the genera-\ntions is passing of certain information about characters between windows\u2014in Table 2.4 we see that pronouns in the\ncontinuations often reflect characters mentioned in the context, and we see an example in which the continuation\nincludes \u201cthe two women\u201d, after a context mentioning \u201cthe aunts\u201d. This behavior was likely learned due to the fact\nthat PG-19 consists of narratives, so correctly passing character information between windows is quite beneficial.\nHowever, these examples also contain discontinuities between the context and the continuation, in terms of\nlocal syntax or facts of the narrative. We see that some sentences are not completed in the expected form (for\ninstance, \u201cThere are lots of ways of being\u201d is continued with a new quote rather than completion of the thought),\nand new characters are sometimes invented rather than continuing to reference those described in the context.\n16\n\n\nModel\nWMT\u201914 De-En\nWMT\u201914 En-De\nWMT\u201916 Ro-En\nWMT\u201916 En-Ro\nSUNDAE (Savinov et al., 2022)\n30.8\n26.3\n-\n-\nSUNDAE (reimplementation)\n28.9\n22.7\n26.3\n20.1\nSUNDAE (reimpl.) + Oracle length\n30.5\n23.8\n26.4\n20.3\nRUM-SUNDAE\n31.2\n23\n33.8\n24.6\nRUM-SUNDAE + Oracle length\n32.7\n25.2\n34.6\n25.3\nTable 4.4: Machine translation results (test set BLEU).

(2022), and also\nevaluate the difference in model performance when using predicted vs reference lengths.\nThe difference between our implementation and the method reported in Savinov et al. (2022) is that we trained\nout length predictors separately from the training of the seq2seq model (for all models including baselines). We\nexpect that this should be strictly better because Savinov et al. (2022) did not use the gradient of the length\nprediction loss to update the encoder weights. As such, training a length predictor after the fact means that the\nlength prediction module can learn to handle inputs from a a fixed encoder rather than one that is being updated\nover time. Further, we can do early stopping for the length predictor only rather than jointly needing to stop training\nthe length predictor and the MT model.\nThe possible drawbacks of this approach are that we had to use the reference sentence length rather than\npredicted lengths for early stopping on the MT model, and also added training complexity due to needing to do\ntwo separate training runs.\nTable 4.4 shows the same results shown in Section 4.4, with additional evaluations using the same translation\nmodel, but producing a number of tokens equal to the length of the reference translation rather than the predicted\nnumber. This led to an increase in BLEU ranging from 0.2 to 2.2, depending on the setting, giving an estimate of\nhow much extra performance may be attained just by improving the quality of length prediction.\nThe analogous results for code translation are shown in table 4.5. In this case the gap between using the\nreference and predicted length was much higher than for natural language translation. However, as CodeBLEU\ntakes semantics as well as n-gram matches into account, it is perhaps unsurprising that this is the case. Producing\none extra incorrect token reduces BLEU by a fixed amount, but for programs may cause them to by syntactically\nincorrect or otherwise entirely change the semantics.\n4.6.2\nContrasting SUNDAE and MLM training\nIn this section we will give a brief overview of SUNDAE (Savinov et al., 2022) training and decoding procedures,\nwhich we use for our experiments in this work. Conceptually, it is very similar to the MLM pretraining task, but has\nimportant changes which we will explain here. We will only describe the method as it applies to encoder-decoder\ntransformers, not the unconditional decoder-only case.\nThe first difference from MLM is that the noise distribution is replaced with uniform random token corruption.\nFor every training source sequence, a clean target sentence is tokenized, then a random proportion is selected\nuniformly in [0, 1]. That proportion of tokens are replaced with a uniformly random token from the vocabulary.\nThe model then processes the noised sentence and attends to the encoder\u2019s embedding of the source sentence to\nproduce the logits, \u2113\u2208RT \u00d7V (where T is sequence length and V is the vocabulary size).

Table 6.3 shows an example where the mode of length 5 is significantly different from all the other modes.\nIt may be impossible to produce a 5 token output that has the right content, but the model \u201cprefers\u201d to output\nsomething grammatical, so we see different content. This is different from the short NMT modes, which were\noften truncated when the constraint was too short to express the content of the source sentence.\nIn order to show that these patterns aren\u2019t just cherry-picked, randomly sampled examples of modal outputs\nare shown in Table B.2. All 30 of the conditional modes are grammatical, relevant to the context, and don\u2019t show\nany evidence of degenerate behavior. This is further evidence that conditional MAP inference may be a promising\ndirection of investigation.\n6.4.3\nDiscussion: Exact modes for cloze completion\nOur findings for this finetuned GPT-2-medium model were essentially the same as what we found for the MT\nmodel. Specifically, the empty sequence is often the modal output, but conditioning on a desired length can yield\nbetter results. The length conditional modes are essentially always grammatical, unlike for the MT model where\nthey were often truncated for shorter target lengths. This is probably because we were able to condition on lengths\nthat were similar to the length of the actual reference continuations, which was not the case for our MT experiments.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time exact and conditional modes have been investigated for a language\nmodel, so this generalizes the prior findings of Stahlberg and Byrne (2019). A priori, we were worried that\nlength-conditional modes from GPT-2 might just be a single word repeated over and over, or a repetition of an\nearlier sentence from the context. The fact that they\u2019re high-quality even for this open-ended task is extremely\nencouraging.\n49\n\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\nReference length percentile\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n% of examples\n(a) Percent of prompts for which each model\u2019s modal re-\nsponse is the empty sequence.\n20\n40\n60\n80\nReference length percentile\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nNormalized log2 P(empty)\nModel\nLLaMA\nAlpaca\nGuanaco\n(b)\nDifference\nbetween\nthe\naverage\nbase-2\nlog-\nprobability of the empty sequence for a particular\nreference length decile, and the average over all ref-\nerence lengths. This relative view is to put all the log\nprobabilities in the same range, see Table 6.4 for the\nabsolute values.\nFigure 6.3: LLaMA 7B, Alpaca 7B, and Guanaco 7B predictions of empty outputs on 1000 prompts from the\ndatabricks-dolly-15k dataset. Prompts are grouped by the decile of the length of the reference response.\nFigure 6.3 shows the same pattern happens with LLaMA as in the earlier experiments: Inputs with longer\nreference lengths have empty modes more often, but the probability of empty outputs either declines or is relatively\nunchanged with length. In Figure 6.3b, Alpaca is the only model that shows a clear trend in terms of empty\nprobability, but even it only changes by a factor of about 2/2\u22120.45 \u22483.\nAs mentioned in Chapter 5, it\u2019s commonly thought that the bad mode problem occurs when a task is less-\nconstrained (meaning there are many correct responses). We don\u2019t have access to multiple references, but we can\nestimate how spread the model\u2019s estimate of output distribution is, then see how that relates to mode emptiness.\nFigure 6.4 shows this relationship, by showing (for each prompt) the logprob of the mode, the average logprob\nover 5 samples10, and whether the modal output is empty.\nThe Alpaca and Guanaco modes support the \u201clevel-of-constraint\u201d hypothesis, with the empty modes only\noccurring when the estimate of the entropy is below some threshold. LLaMA, on the other hand, has empty modes\neven for prompts with fairly low entropies (high sample logprobs). Emitting an EOS token right away is an error for\nthe Alpaca and Guanaco training tasks (conversation/QA), but could actually be correct for the web data LLaMA\nwas trained on.\n6.5.3\nQualitative analysis: Which prompts lead to empty modes?\nInstruction-following is a much more varied task than either MT or story completion, in terms of how constrained\nthe set of responses is. In MT, we\u2019d expect that the entropy of the output roughly scales with the input length.\nWith instruction-following, it\u2019s easy to come up with short inputs that have extremely high output or extremely\nlow entropy.\nIn Chapter 5, we suggested that the bad mode problem shouldn\u2019t be thought of in terms of length, but in terms\nof the entropy of the set of valid outputs. This is often related to length, but can easily be decoupled from it. For\nexample, when prompted with \u201cRecite the Declaration of Independence.\u201d, Alpaca\u2019s global mode is the first 151\ntokens of the preamble, ending with \u201c...to effect their safety and happiness.\u201d On the other hand \u201cWrite a brief\nparagraph of the benefits of attending Arizona State University\u201d is assigned the empty mode. The latter prompt\nhas many valid outputs shorter than 151 tokens, but the entropy of those valid outputs is clearly far higher than the\nentropy of the set of valid responses to the recitation prompt.\nIn the previous section, we quantitatively looked at the relationship between open-endedness and empty modal\noutputs. Here, we also look at it quantitatively by giving more examples of prompts that lead to empty or non-\nempty outputs. Tables B.3, B.4, and B.5 show 10 of each for each of the three LLaMA-based models, which were\nrandomly sampled to avoid cherry-picking.\n10The average log-probability of a sample is just the entropy, so this is an estimate of the negative conditional entropy for a prompt. A lower\nvalue means that the model\u2019s distribution is more spread out for that prompt.\n51\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What trend does the blue line exhibit as the reference length percentile increases, and how does this compare to the trends shown by the other two lines?

{"query": "Context:\n\n52\nChapter 5\nOn the Ability of Graph Neural\nNetworks to Model Interactions\nBetween Vertices\nIn Part II we employed a connection between neural networks (with polynomial non-\nlinearity) and tensor factorizations for studying implicit regularization. In this chapter,\nwhich is based on [180], we extend this connection to analyze the expressive power\nof certain graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we show that message-passing\nGNNs [89] with product aggregation can be formulated via tensor networks \u2014 a\ngraphical language for expressing tensor factorizations.1 The formulation of GNNs\nas tensor networks then allows analyzing their ability to model interactions in an\ninput graph.\n5.1\nBackground and Overview\nGNNs are a family of deep learning architectures, designed to model complex interac-\ntions between entities represented as vertices of a graph. In recent years, GNNs have\nbeen successfully applied across a wide range of domains, including social networks,\nbiochemistry, and recommender systems (see, e.g., [58, 122, 73, 88, 209, 222, 218, 30]).\nConsequently, significant interest in developing a mathematical theory behind GNNs\nhas arisen.\nOne of the fundamental questions a theory of GNNs should address is expressiveness,\nwhich concerns the class of functions a given architecture can realize. Existing studies\nof expressiveness largely fall into three categories. First, and most prominent, are\ncharacterizations of ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs [221, 157, 151, 146,\n15, 27, 19, 29, 70, 69, 171], as measured by equivalence to classical Weisfeiler-Leman\ngraph isomorphism tests [214]. Second, are proofs for universal approximation of\ncontinuous permutation invariant or equivariant functions, possibly up to limitations\nin distinguishing some classes of graphs [152, 117, 40, 145, 10, 69]. Last, are works\nexamining specific properties of GNNs such as frequency response [167, 14] or com-\nputability of certain graph attributes, e.g. moments, shortest paths, and substructure\nmultiplicity [56, 18, 41, 66, 145, 38, 29, 225].\nA major drawback of many existing approaches \u2014 in particular proofs of equiva-\nlence to Weisfeiler-Leman tests and those of universality \u2014 is that they operate in\n1Tensor networks are widely used for constructing compact representations of quantum states in\nareas of physics (see, e.g., [210, 169]).\n\n\n55\n5.2.2\nSeparation Rank: A Measure of Modeled Interaction\nSeparation rank is a prominent measure quantifying the interaction a multivariate\nfunction models between a subset of input variables and its complement (i.e. all other\nvariables). It was introduced in Section 3.5, but for completeness we introduce it here\nonce more.\nThe separation rank was originally defined in [23], and has since been employed\nfor various applications [91, 84, 24]. It is also a common measure of entanglement, a\nprofound concept in quantum physics quantifying interaction between particles [133].\nIn the context of deep learning, it enabled analyses of expressiveness and generaliza-\ntion in certain convolutional, recurrent, and self-attention neural networks, resulting\nin theoretical insights and practical methods (guidelines for neural architecture de-\nsign, pretraining schemes, and regularizers \u2014 see [49, 52, 132, 133, 135, 215, 136] and\nChapter 3).\nGiven a multivariate function f : (RDx)N \u2192R, its separation rank with respect to a\nsubset of input variables I \u2286[N] is the minimal number of summands required to\nexpress it, where each summand is a product of two functions \u2014 one that operates\nover variables indexed by I, and another that operates over the remaining variables.\nFormally:\nDefinition 10. The separation rank of f : (RDx)N \u2192R with respect to I \u2286[N] is\nthe minimal R \u2208N \u222a{0} for which there exist g(1), . . . , g(R) : (RDx)|I| \u2192R and\n\u00af\ng(1), . . . , \u00af\ng(R) : (RDx)|Ic| \u2192R such that:\nf (X) = \u2211\nR\nr=1 g(r)(XI) \u00b7 \u00af\ng(r)(XIc) ,\n(5.1)\nwhere X := (x(1), . . . , x(N)), XI := (x(i))i\u2208I, and XIc := (x(j))j\u2208Ic. By convention,\nif f is identically zero then sep( f; I) = 0, and if the set on the right hand side\nof Equation (5.1) is empty then sep( f; I) = \u221e.\nInterpretation. If sep( f; I) = 1, the function is separable, meaning it does not model\nany interaction between XI and XIc, i.e. between the sides of the partition (I, Ic).\nSpecifically, it can be represented as f (X) = g(XI) \u00b7 \u00af\ng(XIc) for some functions g and\n\u00af\ng. In a statistical setting, where f is a probability density function, this would mean\nthat XI and XIc are statistically independent. The higher sep( f; I) is, the farther f is\nfrom separability, implying stronger modeling of interaction between XI and XIc.\n5.3\nGraph Neural Networks\nGNNs architectures predominantly follow the message-passing paradigm [73, 89],\nwhereby each vertex is associated with a hidden embedding that is updated according\nto its neighbors. The initial embedding of i \u2208V is taken to be its input features:\nh(0,i) := x(i) \u2208RDx. Then, in a depth L message-passing GNN, a common update\nscheme for the hidden embedding of i \u2208V at layer l \u2208[L] is:\nh(l,i) = AGGREGATE\n\u0010\b\n\b\nW(l)h(l\u22121,j) : j \u2208N (i)\n\t\n\t\u0011\n,\n(5.2)\nwhere {\n{\u00b7}\n} denotes a multiset, W(1) \u2208RDh\u00d7Dx, W(2) \u2208RDh\u00d7Dh, . . . , W(L) \u2208RDh\u00d7Dh\nare learnable weight matrices, with Dh \u2208N being the network\u2019s width (i.e. hidden\n\n\n56\ndimension), and AGGREGATE is a function combining multiple input vectors into a\nsingle vector. A notable special case is GCN [122], in which AGGREGATE performs a\nweighted average followed by a non-linear activation function (e.g. ReLU).5 Other\naggregation operators are also viable, e.g. element-wise sum, max, or product (cf. [88,\n100]). We note that distinguishing self-loops from other edges, and more generally,\ntreating multiple edge types, is possible through the use of different weight matrices\nfor different edge types [88, 189]. For conciseness, we hereinafter focus on the case of\na single edge type, and treat multiple edge types in Appendix D.2.\nAfter L layers, the GNN generates hidden embeddings h(L,1), . . . , h(L,|V|) \u2208RDh. For\ngraph prediction, where a single output is produced for the whole graph, the hidden\nembeddings are usually combined into a single vector through the AGGREGATE\nfunction. A final linear layer with weights W(o) \u2208R1\u00d7Dh is then applied to the\nresulting vector.6 Overall, the function realized by a depth L graph prediction GNN\nreceives an input graph G with vertex features X := (x(1), . . . , x(|V|)) \u2208RDx\u00d7|V|, and\nreturns:\n(graph prediction)\nf (\u03b8,G)(X) := W(o)AGGREGATE\n\u0000\b\n\b\nh(L,i) : i \u2208V\n\t\n\t\u0001\n,\n(5.3)\nwith \u03b8 := (W(1), . . . , W(L), W(o)) denoting the network\u2019s learnable weights. For vertex\nprediction tasks, where the network produces an output for every t \u2208V, the final\nlinear layer is applied to each h(L,t) separately. That is, for a target vertex t \u2208V, the\nfunction realized by a depth L vertex prediction GNN is given by:\n(vertex prediction)\nf (\u03b8,G,t)(X) := W(o)h(L,t) .\n(5.4)\nOur aim is to investigate the ability of GNNs to model interactions between vertices.\nPrior studies of interactions modeled by different deep learning architectures have\nfocused on neural networks with polynomial non-linearity, building on their rep-\nresentation as tensor networks [51, 49, 53, 192, 132, 133, 16, 118, 134, 135, 215, 136].\nAlthough neural networks with polynomial non-linearity are less common in practice,\nthey have demonstrated competitive performance [47, 50, 193, 200, 46, 63, 100], and\nhold promise due to their compatibility with quantum computation [78, 25] and\nfully homomorphic encryption [72]. More importantly, their analyses brought forth\nnumerous insights that were demonstrated empirically and led to development of\npractical tools for widespread deep learning models (with non-linearities such as\nReLU).\nFollowing the above, in our theoretical analysis (Section 5.4) we consider GNNs with\n(element-wise) product aggregation, which are polynomial functions of their inputs.\nNamely, the AGGREGATE operator from Equations (5.2) and (5.3) is taken to be:\nAGGREGATE(X ) := \u2299x\u2208X x ,\n(5.5)\nwhere \u2299stands for the Hadamard product and X is a multiset of vectors. The\nresulting architecture can be viewed as a variant of the GNN proposed in [100],\nwhere it was shown to achieve competitive performance in practice. Central to\nour proofs are tensor network representations of GNNs with product aggregation\n5In GCN, AGGREGATE also has access to the degrees of vertices, which are used for computing the\naveraging weights. We omit the dependence on vertex degrees in our notation for conciseness.\n6We treat the case of output dimension one merely for the sake of presentation. Extension of our\ntheory (delivered in Section 5.4) to arbitrary output dimension is straightforward \u2014 the results hold as\nstated for each of the functions computing an output entry.\n\n\n57\n(formally established in Appendix D.3), analogous to those used for analyzing other\ntypes of neural networks. We empirically demonstrate our theoretical findings on\npopular GNNs (Section 5.4.3), such as GCN and GIN with ReLU non-linearity, and\nuse them to derive a practical edge sparsification algorithm (Section 5.5).\nWe note that some of the aforementioned analyses of neural networks with polyno-\nmial non-linearity were extended to account for additional non-linearities, includ-\ning ReLU, through constructs known as generalized tensor networks [48]. We thus\nbelieve our theory may be similarly extended, and regard this as an interesting\ndirection for future work.\n5.4\nTheoretical Analysis: The Effect of Input Graph Structure\nand Neural Network Architecture on Modeled Interac-\ntions\nIn this section, we employ separation rank (Definition 10) to theoretically quantify\nhow the input graph structure and network architecture (width and depth) affect\nthe ability of a GNN with product aggregation to model interactions between input\nvertices. We begin with an overview of the main results and their implications (Sec-\ntion 5.4.1), after which we delve into the formal analysis (Section 5.4.2). Experiments\ndemonstrate our theory\u2019s implications on common GNNs, such as GCN and GIN\nwith ReLU non-linearity (Section 5.4.3).\n5.4.1\nOverview and Implications\nConsider a depth L GNN with width Dh and product aggregation (Section 5.3). Given\na graph G, any assignment to the weights of the network \u03b8 induces a multivariate\nfunction \u2014 f (\u03b8,G) for graph prediction (Equation (5.3)) and f (\u03b8,G,t) for prediction over\na given vertex t \u2208V (Equation (5.4)) \u2014 whose variables correspond to feature vectors\nof input vertices. The separation rank of this function with respect to I \u2286V thus\nmeasures the interaction modeled across the partition (I, Ic), i.e. between the vertices\nin I and those in Ic. The higher the separation rank is, the stronger the modeled\ninteraction.\nKey to our analysis are the following notions of walk index, defined by the number of\nwalks emanating from the boundary of the partition (I, Ic), i.e. from vertices with an\nedge crossing the partition induced by I (see Figure 5.1 for an illustration).\nDefinition 11. Let I \u2286V. Denote by CI the set of vertices with an edge crossing the\npartition (I, Ic), i.e. CI := {i \u2208I : N (i) \u2229Ic \u0338= \u2205} \u222a{j \u2208Ic : N (j) \u2229I \u0338= \u2205}, and\nrecall that \u03c1l(CI, J ) denotes the number of length l \u2208N\u22650 walks from any vertex in\nCI to any vertex in J \u2286V. For L \u2208N:\n\u2022 (graph prediction) we define the (L \u22121)-walk index of I, denoted WIL\u22121(I),\nto be the number of length L \u22121 walks originating from CI, i.e. WIL\u22121(I) :=\n\u03c1L\u22121(CI, V); and\n\u2022 (vertex prediction)\nfor t \u2208V we define the (L \u22121, t)-walk index of I, de-\nnoted WIL\u22121,t(I), to be the number of length L \u22121 walks from CI that end\nat t, i.e. WIL\u22121,t(I) := \u03c1L\u22121(CI, {t}).\nAs our main theoretical contribution, we prove:\n\n\n167\nAppendix D\nOn the Ability of Graph Neural\nNetworks to Model Interactions\nBetween Vertices\nD.1\nTightness of Upper Bounds for Separation Rank\nTheorem 7 upper bounds the separation rank with respect to I \u2286V of a depth L GNN\nwith product aggregation. According to it, under the setting of graph prediction, the\nseparation rank is largely capped by the (L \u22121)-walk index of I, i.e. the number of\nlength L \u22121 walks from CI \u2014 the set of vertices with an edge crossing the partition\n(I, Ic). Similarly, for prediction over t \u2208V, separation rank is largely capped by the\n(L \u22121, t)-walk index of I, which takes into account only length L \u22121 walks from CI\nending at t. Theorem 8 provides matching lower bounds, up to logarithmic terms\nand to the number of walks from CI being replaced with the number of walks from\nany single admissible subset C \u2208S(I) (Definition 13). Hence, the match between the\nupper and lower bounds is determined by the portion of CI that can be covered by\nan admissible subset.\nIn this appendix, to shed light on the tightness of the upper bounds, we present\nseveral concrete examples on which a significant portion of CI can be covered by an\nadmissible subset.\nComplete graph. Suppose that every two vertices are connected by an edge, i.e. E =\n{{i, j} : i, j \u2208V}. For any non-empty I \u228aV, clearly CI = N (I) \u2229N (Ic) = V . In\nthis case, CI = V \u2208S(I), meaning CI is an admissible subset of itself. To see it\nis so, notice that for any i \u2208I, j \u2208Ic, all vertices are neighbors of both I\u2032 := {i}\nand J \u2032 := {j}, which trivially have no repeating shared neighbors (Definition 12).\nThus, up to a logarithmic factor, the upper and lower bounds from Theorems 7 and 8\ncoincide.\nChain graph. Suppose that E = {{i, i + 1} : i \u2208[|V| \u22121]} \u222a{{i, i} : i \u2208V}. For any\nnon-empty I \u228aV, at least half of the vertices in CI can be covered by an admissible\nsubset. That is, there exists C \u2208S(I) satisfying |C| \u22652\u22121 \u00b7 |CI|. For example,\nsuch C can be constructed algorithmically as follows. Let I\u2032, J \u2032 = \u2205. Starting\nfrom k = 1, if {k, k + 1} \u2286CI and one of {k, k + 1} is in I while the other is in Ic,\nthen assign I\u2032 \u2190I\u2032 \u222a({k, k + 1} \u2229I), J \u2032 \u2190J \u2032 \u222a({k, k + 1} \u2229Ic), and k \u2190k + 3.\nThat is, add each of {k, k + 1} to either I\u2032 if it is in I or J \u2032 if it is in Ic, and skip\nvertex k + 2.

This situation is similar to the question-order effect investigated by\nWang et al. [196]. The work of [196] consisted of a series of behavioural experi-\nments where participants were asked the same set of questions in different orders,\nand it was shown that the answers appeared to depend on the order of the ques-\ntions that were asked. In [196], the authors argued that such experiments exhibit\nquantum-like contextuality. However, the authors of [49] demonstrated that the ap-\nparent contextuality was due to signalling.\nWe note here that these models are trivially non-contextual within the generalisa-\ntion of the sheaf-theoretic framework of contextuality. This can be seen as follows.\nLet us start with a decomposition of a given (signalling) empirical model e:\ne = \u03bb \u00b7 eNS + (1 \u2212\u03bb)e\u2032\n(3.5)\nIn the case of the models described above, in any no-signalling model eNS satisfying\n(3.5), the probability distributions of both the SV phrase and the VO phrase collapse\nto a single probability distribution. Therefore, any of the no-signalling empirical\nmodels eNS are trivially non-contextual (i.e. a global probability distribution exists\nand corresponds to the unique probability distribution in the empirical model).\nHowever, these models can exhibit contextuality within the CbD framework. We\nwill therefore focus on the CbD analysis of such cyclic systems of rank 2.\nAs first demonstrated in [194], it is indeed possible to find instances of linguistic\nempirical models of this form that exhibit CbD-contextuality. First, we found two\ncontextual examples in the corpus dataset: empirical models where n = boxer and\nv = adopt, and n = pitcher and v = throw. These empirical models are depicted\nin Fig. 3.3. The degree of non-contextuality of both of these models can also be\ncalculated to be respectively:\nNCNT2(e(boxer,adopt)) = \u22121\n30\n(3.6)\nNCNT2(e(pitcher,throw)) = \u22127\n30\n(3.7)\nWe recall from Section 1.2.3 that the fact that these numbers are negative shows that\nthese models are contextual.\n\n\n102\n3.2.

The study described in [194] provided the first instances of quantum-like\ncontextuality in linguistic scenarios, which takes signalling into account. Previous\nwork existing in the literature [32] have claimed to have violated Bell inequalities in\nnatural language data. However, these did not assume the no-signalling condition\nand were later found to be non-contextual within the CbD framework [49].\nOther contextual cyclic systems of rank 2 emerged from the human judgment\ndataset. These are found in Fig. 3.4b with their degree of contextuality.\n(n, v)\n\u2212NCTN2\n(pitcher, throw)\n0.233\n(boxer, adopt)\n0.033\n(a) Corpus dataset\n(n, v)\n\u2212NCTN2\n(file, admit)\n0.232\n(cabinet, reflect)\n0.199\n(volume, conduct)\n0.111\n(perch, file)\n0.073\n(plant, trap)\n0.052\n(press, file)\n0.042\n(swallow, admit)\n0.021\n(press, conduct)\n0.011\n(port, bill)\n0.008\n(organ, bill)\n0.001\n(b) Human judgment dataset\nFigure 3.4: All of the found examples of CbD-contextual cyclic systems of rank 2\n(sorted by degree of contextuality).\nThe presence of contextuality in quantum systems has some important conse-\nquences. From a foundational point of view, contextuality distinguishes between\nclassical and quantum behaviours [22, 107]. From a computational point of view, it\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. ASPECTS OF THE LEXICAL DISAMBIGUATION PROCESS\n103\nis a resource that allows quantum advantages to arise [94, 3, 48]. The reader should\nrefer back to Section 1.2.1 for a more detailed discussion.\nIn the case of the CbD-contextuality, this interpretation could be clearer. The\nwitnesses of CbD-contextual in linguistics imply that the influence of the context\nover meaning selection is highly non-trivial and consists of a \u201ctruly contextual in-\nfluence\u201d. This finding concurs with the intuition that the context is the main factor\nin the interpretation of lexically ambiguous words.\nDegrees of contextuality\nIn addition to finding out whether a given empirical model is contextual, it is also\npossible to calculate how contextual (or equivalently how non-contextual) a given\nempirical model is within the CbD framework[3]. In this work, we will make use\nof NCNT2 defined in Section 1.2.3 to see how the levels of ambiguity of words can\ninfluence the degree of contextuality.\nResults\nWe calculated the degree of non-contextuality for the empirical models\nand classified them in terms of the ambiguity of their nouns and verbs (see Fig. 3.5).\nWe found that the contextuality mostly depends on the ambiguity of the verb.\nSpecifically, the degree of non-contextuality is higher if the verb is polysemous.\nEquivalently, a rank 2 system will be more contextual whenever the verb is homony-\nmous. Although we observed this trend in both the corpus and human judgment\ndatasets, it was only statistically significant[4] in the latter. The t-test comparing the\ndata concerning homonymous and polysemous had p-value p = 0.006 in the human\njudgment dataset, as opposed to p = 0.314 in the corpus dataset.\nIn addition, we found no dependence on the levels of ambiguity of the nouns\nand the degree of (non-)contextuality in either dataset. The p-values were p = 0.38\nand p = 0.15 for the corpus and the human judgment dataset, respectively.\nDiscussion\nThe conclusions one can draw from the degree of (non-)contextuality\nare hindered by the need for a more operational interpretation of CbD-contextuality.\n[3]It is also possible to calculate some measures of contextuality in the sheaf-theoretic framework,\nthe contextual fraction CF being the most prominently used [3, 4]. We are, however, not making use\nof them in this thesis.\n[4]The definition of statistical significance is standardly defined as follows. A feature is said to be\nstatistically significant iff the associated p-value is less than 0.05.\n\n\n104\n3.2. ON THE QUANTUM-LIKE CONTEXTUALITY OF AMBIGUOUS PHRASES\n(a) Corpus dataset\n(b) Human judgement dataset\nFigure 3.5: Mean NCNT2 depending on whether the noun and verb were polyse-\nmous or homonymous. The errors quoted are the standard errors of the means.\nTherefore, the interpretation of the result is not completely clear.\nA possible interpretation of finding contextual witnesses is the following. Recall\nthat, in the case of cyclic systems of rank 2, the choices of contexts are whether the\npair of words is found in an SV or VO phrase. This result suggests that a verb would\nuse its context more whenever its possible interpretations are unrelated.\nThis conclusion is consistent with the fact that homonymous verbs use the knowl-\nedge of both their subject and object in their first disambiguation stage. In contrast,\npolysemous verbs will use information from a broader context (if available) to be\ndisambiguated.\n3.2.2 Cyclic models of rank 4\nWe have also studied a larger type of empirical model: cyclic systems of rank 4.\nThese models are analogues of the (2,2,2)-Bell scenarios, i.e. scenarios that consist\nof 2 parties, each of these parties having 2 choices of inputs, and each local mea-\nsurement having at 2 possible outcomes. In these models, we take the parties to\nrepresent specific dependency relations, e.g. main verb, subject, or object. In par-\nticular, we will focus on SV models (with parties S and V ) and VO models (with\nparties V and O). In each model, the parties will choose between two words of the\ncorrect grammatical type (i.e. nouns for parties S and O and verbs for V parties).\nEach word will then have two different possible interpretations.\nExample 3.4. Let\u2019s consider an example of a VO model where V is allowed to choose\n\n\nCHAPTER 3. ASPECTS OF THE LEXICAL DISAMBIGUATION PROCESS\n107\nof Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient \u03c1, which will assess whether a monotonic\nrelation exists between two random variables, one being the number of homony-\nmous verbs, subjects, or objects and the other being the degree of non-contextuality\nNCNT2.\nResults\nThe values of the degrees of non-contextuality for each class of empirical\nmodels can be found in Fig. 3.6. An ANalysis Of Variance (ANOVA) first shows\nthat the degrees of non-contextuality are statistically different across the different\ncategories (p < 10\u22124 for SV models and p = 0.005 for VO models).\nIn addition, we observe that in SV models, the degree of non-contextuality in-\ncreases as the number of polysemous verbs and subjects increases. This can be ver-\nified using Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient \u03c1, which was \u03c1 = \u22120.27 with associ-\nated p-value p < 10\u22126 for the correlation with respect to the number of homonymous\nverbs, and \u03c1 = \u22120.20 with p = 0.0002 for the correlation with respect to the number\nof homonymous subjects. In both cases, the negativity of the \u03c1\u2019s shows that NCNT2\ndecreases as the number of homonymous verbs and subjects increases. In addition,\nthe fact that p-values are both < 0.05 shows that we are more than 95% confident\nthat these coefficients are different from 0 (i.e. a correlation exists with a 95% confi-\ndence).\nIn VO models, these trends are much milder and, in fact, not statistically sig-\nnificant. We can see that the degree of direct influence decreases as the number\nof homonymous verbs decreases (\u03c1 = \u22120.11, p = 0.053). However, no monotonic\ncorrelation is found with respect to the number of homonymous objects (\u03c1 = 0.03,\np = 0.52).\nDiscussion\nAs in cyclic systems of rank 2, the main factor influencing the (non-\n)contextuality of the systems is the levels of ambiguity of the verbs. Indeed, we have\nalready shown that the degree of contextuality increases as the number of homony-\nmous verbs increases. This reinforces the intuition that homonymous verbs use their\narguments (here, the context) more intrinsically than their polysemous analogues.\nIn addition, the same applies to homonymous nouns in SV phrases. Namely,\nhomonymous nouns would lead to a higher amount of \u201ctrue\u201d contextuality in the\nobtained probability distributions.\nThe fact that this occurs in SV models only (and not in VO models) suggests that\nthis finding relates to the position of the disambiguating context of homonymous\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Which noun-verb pair in the human judgment dataset exhibits the highest degree of CbD-contextuality, and what is its corresponding -NCTN2 value?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/ff8251459649c7ecac08a4e5d708c4fd.png", "data/qwen_images/0ae7690a5c3f7d28bc64a3fa91a48b7e.png", "data/qwen_images/342964b0c6c7d8ef87d5f23ca23607cd.png", "data/qwen_images/66bdbad8c3b15956fe419d5fb1695eeb.png", "data/qwen_images/61ae436b27c876a45b798b01e69ce1e8.png", "data/qwen_images/0e3ad3143910482decafce36687161e0.png", "data/qwen_images/ccfcba8f0e44352620bab9352050b1fb.png", "data/qwen_images/7b3f3651c202805f1b09798a533ebd13.png", "data/qwen_images/63f62a7eaa2da005b3b5f6dfd503b353.png"]}

On a geographic basis, year-on-year revenue growth was broad-based with North\nAmerica revenue increasing 12% due to strong land and offshore drilling and higher sales of\nproduction systems, while international revenue grew 20%. International growth was widespread\nacross all areas, led by the Middle East & Asia, which grew 21% due to higher drilling and intervention\nactivity.

The APS\nrevenue decline resulted primarily from a temporary production interruption in the projects in Ecuador\nduring the first quarter of 2023 due to a pipeline disruption and lower commodity prices that impacted\nthe project in Canada. The lower exploration data licensing sales were driven by the absence of the\n$95 million of transfer fees recorded in the second quarter of 2022.\n28\n\n\ncomplete the analysis is obtained.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nSLB sponsors several defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all US employees hired\nprior to October 1, 2004. The benefits are based on years of service and compensation, on a career-\naverage pay basis.\nIn addition to the US defined benefit pension plans, SLB sponsors several other international defined\nbenefit pension plans. The most significant of these international plans are the International Staff\nPension Plan and the UK pension plan (collectively, the \u201cInternational plans\u201d). The International Staff\nPension Plan covers certain international employees hired prior to July 1, 2014 and is based on years\nof service and compensation on a career-average pay basis. The UK plan covers employees hired\nprior to April 1, 1999, and is based on years of service and compensation, on a final salary basis.\nThe weighted-average assumed discount rate, compensation increases and expected long-term rate of\nreturn on plan assets used to determine the net pension cost for the US and International plans were\nas follows:\nUS\nInternational\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2023\n2022\n2021\nDiscount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n5.50%\n3.00%\n2.60%\n5.41%\n2.83%\n2.38%\nCompensation increases . . . . . .\n4.00%\n4.00%\n4.00%\n4.84%\n4.83%\n4.82%\nReturn on plan assets . . . . . . . .\n6.00%\n4.40%\n6.60%\n6.00%\n5.05%\n6.73%\n68\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Calculate the total goodwill impairment charge that would have been recorded in the Digital & Integration segment over the two-year period if the goodwill in that segment had been internally assessed as having zero value at the end of 2022.", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/7532febcd12bb8de7b42df5b813614c6.png", "data/qwen_images/d21d42b09749637bfca40b78578ca5f9.png", "data/qwen_images/84a63570ebdc0220bc6cb3d5576d7baf.png", "data/qwen_images/60d269261fb126348c79d37ffd69d11e.png", "data/qwen_images/7779fada4050ce80861a828c5efcc3ad.png", "data/qwen_images/d64779e75d450b32313b67f240d594ad.png", "data/qwen_images/030ad4fe8069c1bdcb114adbc378cbe0.png", "data/qwen_images/e2b864c85907a8107fbbc14c309914ab.png", "data/qwen_images/2e82f1e6ad8049ebe7454c9d9d97c243.png"]}
{"query": "<image>Context:\n\n\u2022 following [Wang et al., 2023e], including an LSTM-based mechanism to model output\nspeaker activities through time (worse performance).\n\u2022 modeling silence with a specific attractor (worse performance).\n\u2022 length normalization of frame embeddings and attractors before performing dot-product\nto effectively compute cosine similarity (worse performance).\n\u2022 using cross-attention to compare frame embeddings and attractors instead of dot-product\n(worse performance).\n\u2022 as analyzed in [Du et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2023e, Plaquet and Bredin, 2023], using\npower set encoding to model the diarization problem instead of per-frame per-speakers\nactivities (worse performance). We believe that the reason for this approach not to work\nwith DiaPer is that, when handling many speakers, the number of classes in the power\nset is too high and most of them are not well represented. This approach has much\nmore potential in scenarios with limited numbers of of speakers as shown in [Plaquet and\nBredin, 2023].\nImplementations of most of these variants can be found in our public repositories in https:\n//github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/DiaPer to enable others to easily experiment with them.\nTwo-speaker telephone conversations\nEven though DiaPer is specifically designed for the scenario with multiple speakers, as it is\ncommon practice, in this section we first present results for the 2-speaker telephone scenario.\nIt should be noted that both EEND-EDA and DiaPer, when trained only with 2-speaker\nSC, learn to only output activities for 2 speakers, even if they are prepared to handle a\nvariable number of them. Figure 4.23 compares the performance on two sets before and\nafter FT to the in-domain development set. Both EEND-EDA and DiaPer were trained on\nthe same data with 5 different parameter initializations to produce the error bars. Results\nshow that DiaPer can reach better performance on both datasets, both with and without\nFT.\n(a) CH Part 2 (2 speakers).\n(b) DH3 CTS full eval.\nFigure 4.23: DER (%) for telephone recordings of Callhome and DIHARD3 conversational\ntelephone speech (CTS) with 2 speakers.\n85\n\n\nmodel. For VBx, these are given by the VAD and OSD models used while for DiaPer those\nperformances are derived from the outputs since there are no specific VAD or OSD modules.\nWe first discuss the results for each dataset separately and then comment on common\npatterns observed for all of them.\n\u2022 AISHELL-4: the clustering-based approach presents far better results than DiaPer.\nThis is observed across all metrics (DER, JER and MSCE). The large percentage of\nmissed speech for DiaPer is connected to its VAD capabilities, possibly due to the\nfact that this dataset was collected with far-field microphones. At the same time,\nthe clustering-based approach has much higher precision for the same OSD recall,\npartly explaining the increased FA speech and confusion in DiaPer. Furthermore,\nthis dataset presents 5.8 speakers per recording on average and while VBx finds 5.5,\nDiaPer finds 4.1 on average. This certainly explains the high confusion error in DiaPer\nand the more-than-twice increase in terms of JER.\n\u2022 AliMeeting far: DiaPer presents almost 10% relative improvement over the VBx-\nbased approach and this can be traced mostly to overlap. While it is true that DiaPer\nperforms slightly better in terms of VAD, the twice better recall regarding OSD with\nrespect to the clustering-based approach gives substantial gains. This provides a clear\nadvantage in AliMeeting where overlapped speech accounts for more than 18% of the\ntime in the test set. In this scenario, the ability of VBx to find the number of speakers\nmore accurately does not compensate DiaPer\u2019s advantage in handling overlap.\n\u2022 AliMeeting near: unlike the far-field scenario, when using near-field microphones,\nthe clustering-based approach is more than 5% relative better than DiaPer.\nThe\ndifferences in terms of MSCE are similar to the far-field case but with near-field\nmicrophones, the OSD performance slightly improves for DiaPer while it improves\nsubstantially for the clustering-based system. The increased OSD recall enables the\nlatter to considerably reduce the missed speech and the higher OSD precision also\nexplains the lower FA.\n\u2022 AMI array: both methods have very low recall percentages in terms of VAD, which\ncontrasts with most other datasets. This is explained by the far-field characteristics\nof this dataset. The VAD system used as part of the clustering-based system is more\nrobust to this situation and this explains the lower missed speech percentage with\nrespect to DiaPer. This dataset presents 3.9 speakers on average in the test set and\nthe clustering-based approach is relatively accurate (as seen in terms of MSCE) finding\n3.4 while DiaPer only finds 2.3 on average. This implies that significant portions of\nspeech are assigned to wrong speakers, explaining the high confusion error for DiaPer\nand the considerably worse JER.\n\u2022 AMI headset: as expected, systems can perform better in the close-talk scenario than\nin the far-field and this is observed across all metrics (DER, JER, MSCE) for AMI\nheadset vs. AMI array. However, DiaPer still struggles to find speech in the close-\ntalk case as seen in the relatively low VAD recall. AMI presents recordings where\ndifferent speakers have very different loudness levels, even if recorded with close-talk\nmicrophones. End-to-end models are considerably biased towards the training data\nand in this case, simulated conversations were generated using recordings from Lib-\nriSpeech for which recordings tend to have similar levels of loudness. We hypothesize\n100\n\n\nthat creating recordings with more variability in loudness could help in this particu-\nlar scenario. Interestingly, the OSD performance for the clustering-based approach is\nconsiderably better than for DiaPer. However, it should be noted that AMI was uti-\nlized to train the OSD system used as part of the clustering-based approach and this\ncould explain these differences. The combination of better VAD, OSD and more accu-\nrate speaker counting certainly explain the better performance of the clustering-based\napproach in this dataset.\n\u2022 Callhome: both systems perform almost the same regarding DER. However, the slight\nadvantage in terms of MSCE for DiaPer shows that it finds the numbers of speakers\nmore accurately and this translates into a considerable difference in terms of JER.\nEven though this dataset can have up to 6 speakers in one conversation, most of the\nrecordings have only 2 and on average there are only 2.6 speakers per conversation.\n\u2022 CHiME6: both systems perform equally poorly. This is perhaps the most challenging\nscenario among all datasets considered in this work, with very long conversations\nhappening in different rooms throughout a single session, with recordings captured\nwith far-field devices and data presenting the highest percentage of overlap (about\n29% in the test set). However, the two systems fail due to different reasons. Even\nthough all recordings have exactly 4 speakers, VBx finds on average 7 speakers while\nDiaPer finds 2.3 on average. This certainly explains the very high confusion errors\nand JER. VBx tends to separate the speech segments of one speaker into more than\none label and eventually confuse them and DiaPer tends to assign segments of speech\nfrom different speakers to the same label. It should be noted that this dataset is\nvery challenging and most of the time there are background noises that sound equally\nloud as the (usually quiet) speakers.\nEven though both systems are trained with\ndata augmentation schemes including background noises, it seems insufficient. Using\na speech enhancement module prior to the application of either system could help in\nboth cases. This could also benefit the models regarding their OSD capabilities and\nespecially regarding VAD where the performance is substandard.\n\u2022 DIHARD2: the clustering-based approach presents around 15% DER relative im-\nprovement over DiaPer; however, the latter finds the correct number of speakers more\naccurately. This set is composed of recordings from a variety of domains and while\nthe number of speakers per recording can vary from 1 to 9, on average there are 3.4\nspeakers and 38% of the recordings contain only 2 speakers. Even though VBx finds\non average 2.5 speakers and is on average closer than DiaPer (with 2.2 on average)\nto the reference, it is almost twice less accurate according to MSCE. It seems that\nDiaPer is in general better able to handle recordings with fewer speakers and this\nis beneficial in this scenario with most recordings having very few speakers (78% of\nrecordings contain 4 or less speakers). Nevertheless, the clustering-based approach\nperforms substantially better in terms of DER and this is mainly due to the lower\nFA and confusion errors. DIHARD2 is among the datasets with lowest percentage of\noverlap. Even though the OSD performance of both systems is far from ideal, the\nOSD for the clustering-based approach operates at a more \u201cconservative\u201d operating\npoint with higher precision and lower recall than DiaPer. Given the low percentage of\noverlap in the test set (below 7%), this means that finding less overlap is eventually\nmore beneficial than finding more, which would potentially result in higher FA and\nmore confusion errors as seen in this case with DiaPer.\n101\n\n\n\u2022 DIHARD3: Similar to DIHARD2, the clustering-based approach performs better\nthan DiaPer.\nThis dataset presents many similitudes with DIHARD2, where the\nmain differences are the removal of day-long recordings with vocalizations from babies\nand their environments and the addition of conversational telephone speech which\naccounts for almost one quarter of the recordings in the whole set. The removal of\nvery challenging recordings and addition of much easier ones explains the decrease in\nerrors for both systems with respect to DIHARD2. The average number of speakers\nin this set is 2.9 and VBx finds 2.4 while DiaPer finds 2.2 on average. Having 61%\nof the files with 2 speakers presents a simpler scenario possibly explaining why VBx\nis substantially more accurate than with DIHARD2. Regarding VAD and OSD, both\nsystems perform better, most likely due to the high percentage of \u201ceasy\u201d telephone\nconversations. However, once again, the conservative OSD in the clustering-based\napproach is most likely the reason for certain advantage of this method over DiaPer.\n\u2022 DipCo: DiaPer presents more than 10% DER relative improvement over the clustering-\nbased approach; however, this is certainly due to the low VAD recall in the latter.\nThis datasets presents a very similar scenario to CHiME6 with far-field microphones\ncapturing dinner-party conversations where speech is very quiet and noises relatively\nloud. Once again, even though each conversation has exactly 4 speakers, VBx finds on\naverage 5.6 speakers and DiaPer finds 3.2, therefore making DiaPer more accurate in\nterms of MSCE. Unlike for CHiME6, DiaPer reaches a reasonable VAD performance\nin DipCo and this explains the reduced DER. However, if a VAD more suited for\nthis scenario was used for the clustering-based approach, this method would most\nlikely reach even better performance since more than 40% of the DER corresponds to\nmissed speech.\n\u2022 Mixer6: DiaPer presents far better results than the clustering-based approach. This\ndataset presents one of the easiest scenarios among all in this work: all conversations\nhave 2 speakers and they consist of interviews in quiet environments. However, the\nconversations were recorded with a distant microphone so some speech segments are\nvery quiet. We hypothesize that this caused the VAD in the clustering-based approach\nto miss a substantial amount of speech and this impacted the performance of the\nsystem quite significantly. DiaPer, alternatively, presents a remarkable performance\nin terms of VAD and most of the errors are due to overlapped speech since it finds\nthe right number of speakers in all recordings.\n\u2022 MSDWild: DiaPer has more than 10% DER relative improvement with respect to the\nclustering-based approach while more than halving the MSCE. This dataset contains\nrecordings with 2 to 4 speakers and 2.6 on average. VBx finds only 1.6 on average while\nDiaPer is more accurate with 2.3 on average. The recordings in this dataset correspond\nto videos from different sources and a high percentage of them have background music.\nAt the same time, recordings are very short: 72 s on average. With VBx, almost half\nof the recordings are labeled with only one speaker (in spite of all of them having at\nleast 2). We hypothesize that this is due to very short recordings which imply few\nsamples for each speaker are available. These combined factors possibly confuse VBx\nto believe that there is a single speaker.\n\u2022 RAMC: both systems perform very similarly in terms of DER; however, VBx is slightly\nmore accurate finding the correct number of speakers (no mistakes at all) and this\n102\n\n\nprobably explains the JER differences. Similarly to Mixer6, this dataset presents a\nvery simple scenario of telephone conversations between two people. However, unlike\nMixer6, close-talk microphones are utilized in this set, therefore imposing less chal-\nlenging acoustic conditions which most likely explain why the VAD in the clustering-\nbased approach performs substantially better than in Mixer6.\n\u2022 VoxConverse: the clustering-based approach performs substantially better than Di-\naPer in all evaluation metrics. This dataset not only has the most variety in terms\nof numbers of speakers per recording but it also presents a higher average number\nof them in the test set with 6.5. DiaPer finds 4.6 speakers on average while VBx\nfinds 5.7 and this explains to great extent the very high confusion error for DiaPer:\nfinding fewer speakers means that, if detected, their speech is necessarily assigned to\nwrong speakers. This, combined with the low precision in terms of OSD, increases\nconsiderably the error when handling multiple speakers. It should be noted that in\nthis dataset, some videos correspond to talk-shows or news shows where spectators\nwhoop or laugh and these segments are sometimes detected as speech. Some record-\nings have background music with singers and these are not labeled in the reference\nannotations. It is debatable if those segments should be considered speech or not but,\nat any rate, more tailored systems should be trained for such situations, possibly by\ngenerating training data accordingly.\nAs observed in the discussions above, building a common system capable of dealing\nwith different datasets presents several challenges for both clustering-based and end-to-end\nsystems. It should be noted that both systems were fine-tuned using in-domain data for\neach dataset; however, VAD and OSD systems in the clustering-based approach were used\nwith their standard configurations, i.e. without any adaptation. This implies that it might\nbe possible to improve the performance for some datasets if, for example, we fine-tuned\nthe hyperparameters of the VAD and OSD systems using their corresponding training sets.\nAt the same time, these systems were trained on large amounts of data, probably leading\nto more robust models and that might be preferable in many cases. In this sense, end-to-\nend models present the advantage of being more easily adaptable to a particular scenario.\nHowever, as seen in these comparisons, clustering-based approaches can be more robust to\ncertain challenging conditions and, therefore, lead to better performance.\nIf one divides the datasets into those with more than 4 speakers (AISHELL-4, Callhome,\nDIHARD2, DIHARD3 full, and VoxConverse), and those with is up to 4 speakers per\nconversation (AliMeeting, AMI, CHiME6, DipCo, Mixer6, MSDWild, and RAMC), we\ncan observe some interesting patterns. The clustering approach obtains better DER in all\nsets in the first group (except for Callhome where the performance is about the same for\nboth approaches). Regarding MSCE, the same pattern holds except for DIHARD2 where\nDiaPer has a lower error. In these datasets, the DER with DiaPer is higher mainly in terms\nof confusion error and most likely due to worse handling of overlapped speech (note the\nlower OSD precision and increased FA and confusion errors). When observing the results\nfor the second group of datasets with limited numbers of speakers, DiaPer shows better\nperformance in some of them (DipCo, Mixer6 and MSDWild) and the clustering approach\nreaches better results for others (AliMeeting near, AMI array and headset) while both\nperform similarly in the remaining sets.\nSince JER is calculated without a collar, it can provide a common ground for comparing\nperformances across datasets. We can observe that datasets with few and a fixed amount\nof speakers such as Mixer6 and RAMC allow for much lower JER (since they only have 2\n103\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: For which dataset does the clustering-based diarization method exhibit significantly less variability in performance compared to the DiaPer method, despite having nearly identical DER values?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/14ba3a61913b0b401202e7642d4f545a.png"]}
{"query": "Context:\n\nAnother motivation regards real-life elections. So, one way of getting data is\nby generating it according to a certain statistical model. This gives us flexibility in\nselecting arbitrarily the number of candidates and the number of voters. However,\nit is also very interesting to analyze real-life data. How do real-life elections relate\nto synthetic data? Are real-life elections similar to each other?\nFinally, our analysis will help us better understand the space of elections in\nitself and will tell us how different two elections can be. In the following, we\nbriefly describe the structure of the dissertation.\n1.3\nStructure\nWe start by describing statistical cultures for sampling ordinal elections and pro-\nvide some insight into the inner structure of such elections. Next, we focus on\nnumerous distances between elections. First, we introduce isomorphic distances\n(that is, distances under which only isomorphic elections are at distances zero).\nThen, we move on to nonisomorphic distances. Later, we evaluate the map of\nelections framework, and study its potential applications. After that, we discuss\nthe distances between elections of different sizes. Finally, we focus on elections\nwith approval ballots and present maps of approval elections. Below we briefly\ndescribe the content of each chapter one by one.\nPreliminaries. Introduction of basic definitions and notation.\nStatistical Cultures. We provide a description of statistical cultures known in the\nliterature, and how to sample elections from these cultures. Next, we present\nmaps of preferences, where we look at relations between votes within a\nsingle election. Informally speaking, it is a microscope view of an election,\ngiving us insight into the structure of the votes.\nDistances. In the first part of this chapter, we define the ELECTION ISOMOR-\nPHISM problem and introduce three isomorphic distance. We say that a\ndistance is isomorphic if, for any two elections that are not isomorphic, the\ndistance between them is larger than zero. These three metrics are the Swap\ndistance, the Spearman distance, and the discrete distance. Unfortunately,\nonly the discrete distance can be computed in polynomial time. As for the\nSwap and Spearman distances, the complexity mostly comes from the fact\nthat we have to find optimal matchings of voters and of candidates at the\n10\n\n\nChapter 3\nStatistical Cultures\nIn this chapter we describe the statistical cultures that we use for generating in-\nstances of elections. First, we describe general models, and then we move on to\nstructured domains. At the end of the chapter, we present maps of preferences,\na simple yet interesting visualization of instances generated from various models\ndescribed below. Maps of preferences help in understanding the structure of the\nvotes and show (dis)similarities between different models.\n3.1\nGeneral Models\nBelow, we define the most popular general1 statistical cultures that we will use\nin this dissertation. When discussing elections, by m we denote the number of\ncandidates, and by n we denote the number of voters.\nImpartial Culture and Related Models\nUnder the impartial culture (IC) model, every preference order appears with the\nsame probability. That is, to generate a vote, we choose a preference order uni-\nformly at random.\nUnder the impartial anonymous culture (IAC) model, we require that each\nvoting situation appears with the same probability [Kuga and Nagatani, 1974,\nFishburn and Gehrlein, 1978]. A voting situation specifies how many votes with\na given preference order are present in a profile; thus, IAC generates anonymized\npreference profiles uniformly at random.\n1By general we mean that any election can be sampled from such statistical culture.\n22\n\n\nChapter 5\nApplications\n5.1\nIntroduction\nCreating a map of elections consists of the three following steps. First, we have\nto prepare the elections\u2014we can either sample them from statistical models or\nselect some real-life ones. Second, we compute the distances between each pair\nof elections\u2014this gives us a distance matrix. Third, we embed the distance matrix\nin a two-dimensional Euclidean space. Each of these steps can be done in numer-\nous ways, that is, there are many ways of generating elections, there are several\ndistances to choose from, and finally we have to decide on a particular embedding\nalgorithm.\nIn the first part of this chapter, we argue that the way we design the map is\nreasonable. We present results for several different embeddings, and explain why\nwe recommend using one over the other. In particular, we analyze the concepts of\nmonotonicity and distortion of embeddings, which test the quality of a given em-\nbedding. We also discuss how changing the number of candidates is influencing\nthe map, in other words, we answer the question of scalability of the map.\nLater, in the second part, we provide numerous practical examples of applica-\ntions of the map. We study single-winner voting rules such as plurality, Borda,\nCopeland, and Dodgson, and multiwinner voting rules such as Chamberlin\u2013\nCourant and Harmonic-Borda. We use the map to show the relationship between\nvarious voting rules and statistical cultures. In particular, we are curious if elec-\ntions lying next to one another on the map behave in a similar manner\u2014for exam-\nple, the winning candidate/committee has a similar score, or computing the win-\nning candidate or committee is taking similar amount of time. For example, for\n79\n\n\nscore, AV returns all tied committees. The second rule is Proportional Approval\nVoting (PAV). PAV outputs all committees with the maximum PAV-score:\nscorepav(W) = P\nv\u2208V h(|A(v) \u2229W|),\nwhere h(x) = Px\nj=1 1/j is the harmonic function. Intuitively, AV selects commit-\ntees that contain the \u201cbest\u201d candidates (in the sense of having the most approvals)\nand PAV selects committees that are in a strong sense proportional [Aziz et al.,\n2017, Brill et al., 2018]. In contrast to AV, which is polynomial-time computable,\nPAV is NP-hard to compute [Aziz et al., 2015, Skowron et al., 2016]. In practice,\nPAV can be computed by solving an integer linear program [Peters and Lackner,\n2020] or by an approximation algorithm [Dudycz et al., 2020].\nCohesive Groups.\nIntuitively, a proportional committee should represent all\ngroups of voters in a way that (roughly) corresponds to their size. To speak of\nproportional committees in ABC elections, Aziz et al. [2017] introduced the con-\ncept of cohesive groups.\nDefinition 7.1. Consider an ABC election (C, V, k) with n voters and some non-\nnegative integer \u2113. A group of voters V \u2032 \u2286V is \u2113-cohesive if (i) |V \u2032| \u2265\u2113\u00b7 n\nk and\n(ii)\n\f\n\fT\nv\u2208V \u2032 A(v)\n\f\n\f \u2265\u2113.\nAn \u2113-cohesive group is large enough to deserve \u2113representatives in the com-\nmittee and is cohesive in the sense that there are \u2113candidates that can represent\nit. A number of proportionality notions have been proposed based on cohesive\ngroups, such as (extended) justified representation [Aziz et al., 2017], propor-\ntional justified representation [S\u00e1nchez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017], proportionality\ndegree [Skowron, 2021], and others. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that\nall these concepts guarantee cohesive groups different types and levels of repre-\nsentations (see also the survey of Lackner and Skowron [2023] for a comprehen-\nsive overview).\n7.3\nStatistical Cultures for Approval Elections\nIn the following, we present several statistical cultures (probabilistic models) for\ngenerating approval elections. Our input consists of the desired number of voters n\nand a set of candidates C = {c1, . . . , cm}. For models that already exist in the\nliterature, we provide examples of papers that use them.\n149\n\n\nWe move on to the results for the six other datasets. Note that each figure also\ncontains the background dataset (gray dots) for reference. These results help to\nunderstand the differences between our statistical cultures.\nThe maximum approval score statistic provides insight into whether there is\na candidate that is universally supported. Instances with a value close to 1 pos-\nsess such a candidate. In a single-winner election, this candidate is likely to be a\nclear winner. This is undesirable when simulating, for example, contested elec-\ntions. Also note that in the real-world data set (Pabulib) we do not observe such\ncandidates.\nWhen looking at the PAV runtime, we find some statistical cultures that gener-\nate computationally difficult elections, such as, e.g., the (p, \u03d5)-resampling model\nwith parameter values close to p = 0.5 and \u03d5 = 1 (0.5-IC), the noise model with\nparameters p \u2208[0.5, 0.9] and \u03d5 > 0.5, and the disjoint model with g = 2. Yet,\ninstances from the real-world dataset, as well as from the Euclidean and urn ones,\ncan be computed very quickly.3\nConcerning voters in cohesive groups, whenever this statistic is close to 1, it is\neasy to satisfy most voters with at least one approved candidate in the committee;\nsuch committees are easy to find [Aziz et al., 2017]. Since many proportional\nrules take special care of voters who belong to cohesive groups, in such elections\nthere are no voters that are at a systematic disadvantage. In many of our generated\nelections (almost) all voters belong to 1-cohesive groups, but this is not the case\nfor the real-world, Pabulib data. Indeed, to simulate Pabulib data well, we would\nlikely need to provide some new statistical culture(s).\nFor the cohesiveness level, we see that all models generate a full spectrum\n(i.e., [0, 10]) of cohesiveness levels. However, we expect realistic elections to\nappear in the \u201clower left\u201d part of our grid (with few approvals), and such elections\ntend to have low cohesiveness levels. Indeed, this is also the case for the Pabulib\nelections. Hence, it is important how proportional rules treat \u2113-cohesive groups\nwith small \u2113.\n7.7.3\nCorrelation\nFigures 7.4 to 7.7 are based on the approvalwise distance. We argue that they\nwould not change much if we used the (computationally intractable) isomorphic\n3Less than 1 second on a single core (Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 CPU @ 2.70GH) of a 224 core\nmachine with 6TB RAM. In contrast, the worst-case instance (0.3-IC) required 25 minutes on 13\ncores.\n165\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How well do the statistical cultures described in the text capture the characteristics of real-world elections, and what implications does this have for the design and evaluation of proportional voting rules?", "response": "", "images": []}

All Leica M lenses \nwith focal lengths between 16 and 135\u2009mm are coupled automatical\u00ad\nly when they are attached to a camera. The viewfinder has a magnifi\u00ad\ncation factor of 0.73x.\nThe bright-line frame is coupled with the focusing function in such \na way that the parallax \u2013 the offset between the lens axis and the \nviewfinder axis \u2013 is compensated automatically. At ranges under 2\u2009m, \nthe sensor captures slightly less than indicated by the inner edges \nof the bright-line frame, and slightly more at longer ranges (see ad\u00ad\njacent diagram). These slight \u2013 in practical terms never important \u2013 \ndeviations are unavoidable. The bright-line frames of a camera with \nviewfinder must be adjusted to the view angle of the focal length of \nthe lens. The nominal view angle changes slightly when focusing due \nto the changing draw-out, i.e. the distance of the lens system to the \nsensor level. When the set distance is below infinity (and the draw-\nout accordingly greater), the actual view angle also decreases \u2013 the \nlens captures less of the image object. The view angle differences at \ngreater focal lengths tend to be larger due to the greater draw-out.\n22:45 \nPM 22.02.2012\n999-9000\n8234/9999\n12MP\n2.8\nF\n1/8000\n12500\nISO \nEV \nINFO\nA\nB\nAll shots and bright-line frame positions at 50\u2009mm focal length\nA\nBright-line frame\nB\nActual image field\nSet to 0.7\u2009m\nThe sensor captures around one frame width less\nSet to 2\u2009m\nThe sensor captures the exact image field shown with\u00ad\nin the inner edges of the bright-line frame\nSet to infinity\nThe sensor detects around 1 or 4 more (vertical or \nhorizontal) frame width(s)\nNotes\n\u2022\tThe bright-light frames illuminated by white light LEDs appear \nalongside the exposure meter LEDs at the lower edge of the view\u00ad\nfinder image, once the camera electronics are activated.\n\u2022\tThe rectangular focus frame, which is brighter than the surround\u00ad\ning title frame, is in the center of the viewfinder frame.

Image sharpness can be set via the \ndouble-image or the split-image method.\nDOUBLE-IMAGE METHOD\nFor a portrait, you might focus on the eyes using the focus frame of \nthe rangefinder, turning the focus ring on the lens until the contours \nare aligned exactly inside the focus frame.\nout of focus\nin focus\nSPLIT-IMAGE METHOD\nFor an architectural photograph, you might aim the focus frame of \nthe rangefinder at e.g. the vertical edge or any other clearly defined \nvertical line and keep turning the focus ring on the lens until the \nedge contour or the line is visible at the outer edges of the focus \nframe without any offset.\nout of focus\nin focus\nNotes\n\u2022\tVery precise focusing are particularly beneficial when using \nwide-angle lenses with a relatively large depth of field.\n\u2022\tThe focus frame of the rangefinder is displayed as a bright, sharp-\nedged rectangle in both methods. The position of the focus frame \ncannot be changed.

Crooze technology brings a no-code business process application builder, an extensive set of metadata \ntools, customizable dashboard views, and content automation \u2014 to our secure, intelligent Content Cloud. With Crooze, customers can quickly \naddress key business process use cases, including managing contracts, document libraries and digital assets. We expect to soon have Crooze \ntechnology integrated natively into the Box Content Cloud to help our customers power content experiences and workflows. \n\u2022\nEnhancements to Box Sign \u2013 Added support for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance, ability to specify recipient groups for faster time-to-signature, \ncustomizable signature request expiration dates, dropdown menus, radio buttons, and signer attachment fields, ability for senders to prefill fields \nand toggle them as read-only fields, keyboard shortcuts and commands, ability to embed signing experience within custom applications, reusable \ntemplate APIs, webhook support to detect bounced email IDs, and pre-built third-party integrations with Workato and Slack Workflow Builder.\n\u2022\nEnhancements to Integrations \u2013 Added Box for Microsoft Office desktop co-authoring to customers in Microsoft\u2019s Semi-Annual Channel for \nOffice 365 updates, Box for Microsoft Teams enhancements so users can edit Box Notes and Microsoft Office files on Box directly in Teams, and \nnew Box Embed \n53\n\n\n\u00a0\nA calculation of billings starting with revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented below (in thousands):\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nGAAP revenue\n\u00a0 $\n1,037,741 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n990,874 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n874,332 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nDeferred revenue, end of period\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n586,871 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n566,630 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n534,242 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nLess: deferred revenue, beginning of period\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(566,630 ) \u00a0\n\u00a0\n(534,242 ) \u00a0\n\u00a0\n(465,613 ) \u00a0\nContract assets, beginning of period\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n1,900 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n1,111 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n25 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nLess: contract assets, end of period\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(2,452 )\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(1,900 )\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(1,111 )\n\u00a0\nBillings\n\u00a0 $\n1,057,430 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n1,022,473 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n941,875 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP Free Cash Flow\nWe define non-GAAP free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance \nlease liabilities, capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management \nconsiders to be outside of our core business.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended January 31, 2024 was $318.7 million, representing an increase of 7% from the year ended \nJanuary 31, 2023. Non-GAAP free cash flow for the year ended January 31, 2024 was $269.0 million, representing an increase of 13% from the year ended \nJanuary 31, 2023. \nA reconciliation of non-GAAP free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented in the non-GAAP \nFinancial Measures section at the end of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is also not meant to be \nconsidered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nNet Retention Rate\nNet retention rate is defined as the net percentage of Total Annual Recurring Revenue (Total ARR) retained from existing customers, including \nexpansion. We define Total ARR as the annualized recurring revenue from all active customer contracts at the end of a reporting period. We calculate our net \nretention rate as of a period end by starting with the Total ARR from customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period Total ARR). We then \ncalculate Total ARR from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period Total ARR). Finally, we divide the Current Period Total ARR by \nthe Prior Period Total ARR to arrive at our net retention rate. In calculating our net retention rate, we include only Total ARR associated with those customers \nwho have subscribed to Box for at least 12 months. We believe our net retention rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our \nsubscription agreements and our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customer base. Net retention rate is an operational metric and there is no \ncomparable GAAP financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric.\nOur net retention rate was 101%, 108%, and 111% as of January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decline in our net retention rate as of \nJanuary 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to heightened budget scrutiny putting pressure on seat expansion within existing customers and increased customer \nchurn. As our customers purchase add-on products or our bundled Enterprise Plus plan, we tend to realize significantly higher average contract values and \nstronger net retention rates as compared to customers who only purchase our core product. We believe our go-to-market efforts to deliver a solution selling \nstrategy and our investments in product, customer success, and Box Consulting, including our Box Shuttle migration offering, have been significant factors in \nour customer retention results. As we penetrate customer accounts, we expect our net retention rate to remain above 100% for the foreseeable future.\n56\n\n\n\u00a0\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended January 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $318.7 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows \nduring this period were our net income of $129.0 million, stock-based compensation of $198.8 million, amortization of deferred commissions of $54.2 million, \nand depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and capitalized software of $51.2 million, partially offset by a non-cash income tax benefit \nfrom the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $75.2 million. Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended January 31, 2024 \nwas further adjusted by net cash outflows of $41.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. \nThe primary drivers for the changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $49.3 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to recurring lease \npayments, a $44.5 million increase in deferred commissions resulting from capitalization of incremental commissions paid to our sales force, and a $21.9 \nmillion increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of our cash collections. This was partially offset by a $35.2 million decrease in operating \nright-of-use assets due to amortization, a $32.7 million increase in deferred revenue, and a $6.8 million decrease in other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities of $82.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by $169.4 million in purchases of short-term \ninvestments that were partially offset by $108.0 million in maturities of short-term investments, $16.6 million in capitalized internally developed software costs, \n$2.7 million in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $1.8 million of fixed asset purchases, net of sale proceeds.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $272.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by $177.1 million in repurchases of our \ncommon stock, $74.7 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock awards, $30.2 million of principal payments of finance \nlease liabilities, and $14.9 million of dividend payments to preferred stockholders. This was partially offset by $28.2 million from issuances of common stock \nunder our employee equity plans.\nDebt\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026. The Convertible Notes \nare senior unsecured obligations and do not bear regular interest. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes is convertible into 38.7962 shares of \nour Class A common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $25.78 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified \nevents. We have made an irrevocable election to settle the principal portion of the Convertible Notes only in cash. Accordingly, upon conversion, we will pay \nthe principal in cash and we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, the conversion premium in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and \nshares of common stock, at our election.\nOn November 27, 2017, we entered into a secured credit agreement (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the \u201cNovember 2017 \nFacility\u201d), which provided for a $65.0 million revolving loan facility with a $45.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. On June 30, 2023, we \nentered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the \u201cJune 2023 Facility\u201d) to provide for a $150.0 million revolving loan facility and maintain the $45.0 \nmillion letter of credit sublimit.\nRefer to Note 9 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed descriptions of the Convertible Notes, the November 2017 Facility, \nand the June 2023 Facility.\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn April 7, 2021 we entered into an Investment Agreement with KKR and certain other investors relating to the issuance and sale of 500,000 shares of \nour Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value of $0.0001 per share, \n62\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax \npositions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical \nmerits of the position. Significant judgment is required in determining the technical merits of an uncertain tax position, such as taking into account current tax \nlaws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the effect of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements on \nour financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP \nfinancial information. Our measure of non-GAAP free cash flow (as defined above) meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures and our key metrics for financial and operational decision-making (including for purposes of determining variable \ncompensation of members of management and other employees) and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP \nfinancial measures and key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be \nindicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial \nmeasures and key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures and \nkey metrics also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to our competitors\u2019 operating results. We \nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key \nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to \nhelp them analyze the health of our business.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin\nWe define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation (SBC), acquired \nintangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) divided by \nrevenue. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based \ninstruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon \nthe vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of our \nongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our \ncontrol. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of stock-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant \nrecipients. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate \ncomparison of our results to those of peer companies. Management also views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of \nthe cost associated with an acquired company\u2019s developed technology and trade names, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of \nan acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one \nthat is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Furthermore, Box excludes the following expenses as they are considered by \nmanagement to be special items outside of Box\u2019s core operating results: (1) fees related to shareholder activism, (2) expenses related to certain litigation, (3) \nexpenses associated with a non-recurring workforce reorganization, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and (4) expenses related \nto acquisitions.\n64\n\n\n\u00a0\nOur reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for years ended January 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands, except \nper

{"query": "<image><image><image><image><image><image>Context:\n\nItem 1A.\nRisk Factors\nOur business, operations, and financial position are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below, \nand the reader should take such risks into account in evaluating Encompass Health or any investment decision involving \nEncompass Health. This section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us, our industry, or our business, and it is \nintended only as a summary of material risk factors. More detailed information concerning other risks and uncertainties as well \nas those described below is contained in other sections of this annual report. Still other risks and uncertainties we have not or \ncannot foresee as material to us may also adversely affect us in the future. If any of the risks below or other risks or \nuncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report are actually realized, our business and financial condition, results of \noperations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. In the event the impact is materially adverse, the trading price of our \ncommon stock could decline.\nRisks Related to the Spin Off of Our Home Health and Hospice Business\nWe may not be able to engage in beneficial capital-raising or strategic transactions.\nOn July 1, 2022, we completed the previously announced separation of our home health and hospice business through \nthe distribution (the \u201cSpin Off\u201d) of all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Enhabit, Inc. \n(\u201cEnhabit\u201d) to the stockholders of Encompass Health. As a result of the Spin Off, Enhabit is now an independent public \ncompany and its common stock is listed under the symbol \u201cEHAB\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. The Spin Off is intended \nto be a tax-free transaction. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a spin off that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment \ncan be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off transactions, including \ncertain acquisitions of shares or assets of the parent corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin Off, we may be \nlimited, for a period of time, in our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases, or other \ntransactions (including certain dispositions of assets) that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our \nstockholders or that might increase the value of our business.\nIf the Spin Off were to fail to qualify as tax-free, including as a result of transactions in our stock or the stock of Enhabit, \nwe could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nWe received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters \nrelating to the Spin Off and its associated transactions and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain \nelements of those transactions. Although we intend for the Spin Off to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there \ncan be no assurance that the Spin Off will not trigger a tax event. Even if the Spin Off were to otherwise qualify as a tax-free \ntransaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, it may result in taxable gain to us (but not our \nstockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if it is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to \nwhich one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater ownership interest (by vote or \nvalue) in us or Enhabit. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Spin Off acquisitions of our stock or that of Enhabit, \npursuant to such a plan (when aggregated with any pre-Spin Off acquisitions of our stock or that of Enhabit, as applicable, \npursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater ownership interest therein, such determination could result in \nsignificant tax liabilities to us. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in our stock.\nUnder a tax matters agreement we entered into with Enhabit in connection with the Spin Off, Enhabit is required to \nindemnify us for any taxes we incur resulting from the Spin Off to the extent such amounts result from certain disqualifying \nactions by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Enhabit. Additionally, Enhabit is generally required to indemnify us for a \nspecified portion of any taxes we incur (a) arising as a result of the failure of the Spin Off and certain related transactions to \nqualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free or a failure of the Spin Off that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is \ngenerally tax-free to so qualify to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity \nsecurities of, Enhabit or us or (b) arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to the \nSpin Off that were not intended to qualify as tax-free. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be \nsignificant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Enhabit to which we are entitled under the tax \nmatters agreement or other agreements entered into in connection with the Spin Off, we would incur significant losses.\n18\nFORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe following table presents the results of operations of Enhabit as discontinued operations (in millions):\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nNet operating revenue\n$ \n542.3 $ \n1,106.6 \nOperating expenses:\nSalaries and benefits\n376.4 \n759.2 \nOther operating expenses\n47.5 \n89.7 \nOccupancy costs\n11.0 \n21.2 \nSupplies\n11.7 \n25.1 \nGeneral and administrative expenses\n59.3 \n27.9 \nDepreciation and amortization\n16.7 \n36.9 \nTotal operating expenses\n522.6 \n960.0 \nInterest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees\n0.2 \n0.3 \nOther income\n\u2014 \n(4.8) \nEquity in net income of nonconsolidated affiliates\n\u2014 \n(0.6) \nIncome from discontinued operations before income taxes\n19.5 \n151.7 \nProvision for income tax expense\n4.3 \n37.6 \nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\n15.2 \n114.1 \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests included in discontinued \noperations\n(1.3) \n(1.8) \nNet income attributable to Encompass Health included in discontinued \noperations\n$ \n13.9 $ \n112.3 \nTransaction costs of $56.7 million and $22.9 million incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, \nrespectively, are included in general and administrative expenses in the table above and in (Loss) income from discontinued \noperations, net of tax, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. These charges primarily related to third-party \nadvisory, consulting, legal and professional services, that were associated with the Spin Off.\nDuring 2023, we incurred legal costs of $15.8 million related to ongoing litigation against former executive officers of \nour home health and hospice business. These costs are included in (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in \nthe consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n3.\nBusiness Combinations:\n2023 Acquisitions\nDuring 2023, we completed the following acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our financial \nposition, results of operations, or cash flows. Each acquisition was made to enhance our position and ability to provide inpatient \nrehabilitation services to patients in the applicable geographic areas.\n\u2022\nIn March 2023, we acquired 50% of the operations of a 24-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in Eau Claire, Wisconsin\nwhen Hospital Sisters Health System contributed those operations to our existing joint venture.\n\u2022\nIn March 2023, we acquired 50% of the operations of a 48-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in Knoxville, Tennessee\nwhen Covenant Health contributed those operations to our existing joint venture.\n\u2022\nIn September 2023, we acquired 50% of the operations of a 29-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in Columbus, Georgia\nwhen Piedmont Healthcare, Inc. contributed those operations to our existing joint venture.\nWe accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations\nof the acquired hospitals from the respective dates of acquisition. Assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values as \nEncompass Health Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nF-23\nTable of Contents\n\n\n2022 Acquisitions\nDuring 2022, we completed the following acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our financial \nposition, results of operations, or cash flows. Each acquisition was made to enhance our position and ability to provide inpatient \nrehabilitation services to patients in the applicable geographic areas.\n\u2022\nIn August 2022, we acquired 60% of the operations of a 23-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in Grand Forks, North\nDakota when Altru Health System contributed those operations to our existing joint venture.\n\u2022\nIn August 2022, we acquired 50% of the operations of a 22-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in Moline, Illinois when\nTrinity Medical Center contributed those operations to our existing joint venture.\n\u2022\nIn December 2022, we acquired 50% of the operations of a 54-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in Naples, Florida when\nNCH Healthcare System contributed those operations to our joint venture.\nWe accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations\nof the acquired hospitals from the respective dates of acquisition. Assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values as \nof the acquisition date. Estimated fair values were based on an income approach using discounted cash flow techniques for the \nnoncompete intangible assets. The aforementioned income method utilizes management\u2019s estimates of future operating results \nand cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital.

Each acquisition was made to enhance our position and ability to provide inpatient \nrehabilitation services to patients in the applicable geographic areas.\n\u2022\nIn April 2021, we acquired 51% of the operations of a 14-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in San Angelo, Texas when\nShannon Medical contributed those operations to our existing joint venture entity.\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, we acquired 75% of the operations of a 16-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in McKees Rocks,\nPennsylvania through our existing joint venture with Heritage Valley Health System, Inc. The acquisition was funded\nusing cash on hand.\n\u2022\nIn July 2021, we acquired 65% of the operations of a 22-bed inpatient rehabilitation unit in Odessa, Texas when\nECHD Ventures contributed those operations to our existing joint venture entity.\nWe accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations\nof the acquired hospitals from its respective date of acquisition. Assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values as \nof the acquisition date. Estimated fair values were based on various valuation methodologies including: an income approach \nusing primarily discounted cash flow techniques for the noncompete intangible assets and an income approach utilizing the \nrelief from royalty method for the trade name intangible asset. The aforementioned income methods utilize management\u2019s \nestimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market \nparticipant assumptions. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the assets acquired \nwas recorded as goodwill. The goodwill reflects our expectations of our ability to gain access to and penetrate the acquired \nhospital\u2019s historical patient base and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth \nopportunities based on positive demographic trends in this market. None of the goodwill recorded as a result from these \ntransactions is deductible for federal income tax purposes.\nThe fair value of the assets acquired at the acquisition dates were as follows (in millions):\nIdentifiable intangible assets:\nNoncompete agreements (useful lives of 3 to 5 years)\n$ \n1.0 \nTrade name (useful life of 20 years)\n0.3 \nGoodwill\n8.8 \nOther long-term assets\n0.1 \nTotal assets acquired\n$ \n10.2 \nEncompass Health Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nF-26\nFORM 10-K\nTable of Contents\n\n\n9.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nThe following table shows changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill (in millions):\nAmount\nGoodwill as of December 31, 2020\n$ \n1,228.2 \nAcquisitions\n8.8 \nGoodwill as of December 31, 2021\n1,237.0 \nAcquisitions\n26.2 \nGoodwill as of December 31, 2022\n1,263.2 \nAcquisitions\n18.1 \nGoodwill as of December 31, 2023\n$ \n1,281.3 \nGoodwill increased in 2021, 2022 and 2023 as a result of our acquisitions of inpatient rehabilitation operations.

We may stop drawing the profits if the aggregate balance of the statutory common reserve has already accounted for over \n50% of our registered capital. See \u201cItem 4. Information on the Company\u2014B. Business Overview\u2014Regulations\u2014Regulations of Foreign \nCurrency Exchange, Foreign Debt and Dividend Distribution\u201d for further details. \nAny limitation on the ability of our wholly-owned PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could \nmaterially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay \ndividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. \nIn addition, the EIT Law and its implementation rules provide that withholding tax rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends \npayable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or \narrangements between the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC-resident \nenterprises are incorporated. \nWith respect to our Hong Kong entities, although currently there are not equivalent or similar restrictions or limitations in Hong \nKong on cash transfers in, or out of, our Hong Kong entities (including currency conversion), if certain restrictions or limitations in \nmainland China were to become applicable to cash transfers in and out of Hong Kong entities (including currency conversion) in the \nfuture, the funds in our Hong Kong entities, likewise, may not be available to meet our currency demand.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment. \nThe conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People\u2019s Bank of China. \nThe Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. The value of Renminbi against the U.S. \ndollar and other currencies is affected by changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions and by China\u2019s foreign exchange policies, \namong other things. We cannot assure you that Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar \nin the future. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between \nRenminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. \nAny significant appreciation or depreciation of Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our revenues, earnings and financial \nposition, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our ADSs in U.S. dollars. For example, to the extent that we need to convert \nU.S. dollars we receive from our initial public offerings or convertible senior notes offering into Renminbi for our operations, \nappreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the \nconversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on \nour ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative \neffect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. \nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have entered \ninto some hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may continue to enter \ninto hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to \nadequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control \nregulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material \nadverse effect on your investment. \nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our cash balance effectively and affect the value of your \ninvestment. \nThe PRC government imposes control on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the \nremittance of currency out of China. We receive part of our revenues in Renminbi. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, \npayments of current account items, including profit distributions, and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be \nmade in foreign currencies without prior SAFE approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, our PRC \nsubsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from the SAFE. However, approval from or \nregistration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted \nout of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also \nat its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. Although currently there are not \nequivalent or similar restrictions or limitations in Hong Kong on cash transfers in, or out of, our Hong Kong entities (including currency \nconversion), if certain restrictions or limitations in mainland China were to become applicable to cash transfers in and out of Hong Kong \nentities (including currency conversion) in the future, the funds in our Hong Kong entities, likewise, may not be available to meet our \ncurrency demand. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign \ncurrency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of the ADSs. \n\n\n48\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price of Kingsoft Corporation, one of our principal shareholders, or news about Kingsoft \nCorporation that has an impact on us; \n\u2022\nfailure on our part to realize monetization opportunities as expected; \n\u2022\nchanges in revenues generated from our top customers; \n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; \n\u2022\ndetrimental negative publicity about us, our management, our competitors or our industry; \n\u2022\nshort seller reports that make allegations against us or our affiliates, even if unfounded; \n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting us or our industry; and \n\u2022\npotential litigation or regulatory investigations. \nThe Staff of the Division of Enforcement of the SEC conducted an investigation relating to our disclosures for fiscal year 2015 \nregarding our relationship with one of our advertising business partners. The SEC investigation also related to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans \nentered into by certain of our current and former officers and directors and sales of our ADS under those plans in 2015 and 2016. On \nSeptember 21, 2022, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Sheng Fu, reached a resolution with the SEC. To our \nknowledge, pursuant to the terms of the settlement, Mr. Fu has consented to the entry of a cease and desist order with the SEC on a \n\u201cneither admit nor deny\u201d basis that would require him to refrain from violating (i) Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933, \nand (ii) Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, and 13a-1 thereunder. The terms of \nthe settlement between Mr. Fu and the SEC also include payment of a civil money penalty in the amount of $556,580 and certain \ncompliance undertakings. We were not a party to the settlement. The SEC informed us that it had concluded its investigation with respect \nto us and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action. See \u201cItem 8. Financial Information\u2014A. Consolidated Statements and \nOther Financial Information\u2014Legal Proceedings.\u201d  \n In addition, the price of the ADSs may fluctuate due to broad market and industry factors, such as the performance and fluctuation \nin the market prices or the underperformance or deteriorating financial results of other similarly situated companies in China that have \nlisted their securities in the United States in recent years. The securities of some of these companies have experienced significant \nvolatility since their initial public offerings, including, in some cases, substantial declines in trading price. The trading performance of \nthese Chinese companies\u2019 securities after their offerings, including the securities of companies in the mobile and PC internet businesses, \nmay affect the attitudes of investors toward Chinese companies listed in the United States, which consequently may impact the trading \nperformance of the ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions about \ninadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting or other practices at other Chinese companies may also negatively \naffect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies in general, including us, regardless of whether we have engaged in such \npractices. In addition, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related \nto our operating performance, such as the large decline in share prices in the United States, China and other jurisdictions between late \n2008 and 2012, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the ADSs. \nOur ADSs may be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange as a result of our failure of meeting the New York Stock Exchange \ncontinued listing requirements. \nWe are required to meet certain quantitative tests as well as corporate governance and other qualitative standards to maintain the \nlisting of our ADSs on the NYSE. It is possible that we could fail to satisfy one or more of these requirements. \nPursuant to NYSE rule 802.01C, a company is considered to be below compliance standards if the average closing price of a \nsecurity as reported on the consolidated tape is less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. We received a letter from the \nNYSE dated April 15, 2022, notifying us that we were below the foregoing compliance standard. Pursuant to NYSE rule 802.01C, once \nnotified, a company must bring its share price and average share price back above $1.00 within six months following receipt of the \nnotification. If on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period the company has a closing share price of at least \n$1.00 and an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month, \nthen the company can regain compliance at any time during the six-month cure period. In the event that at the expiration of the six-\nmonth cure period, both a $1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a $1.00 average closing share price \nover the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension \nand delisting procedures. We changed the ratio of our ADS to Class A ordinary share from one (1) ADS representing ten (10) Class A \nordinary shares to one (1) ADS representing fifty (50) Class A ordinary shares, effective September 2, 2022. We have regained \ncompliance with the NYSE standards because subsequent to receipt of the letter, our ADSs traded above US$1.00 over a consecutive \n30 trading-day period. However, there can be no assurance that we will always be compliant with such standards going forward. \n\n\n49\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with any other continued listing requirements \nof the NYSE. In the event of deficiency or non-compliance, we could receive notices from the NYSE and suffer loss of investor \nconfidence and trading price decline. If we fail to regain compliance in time, we could face trading suspension or even delisting from \nthe NYSE, which could make it more difficult to obtain accurate quotations of and to buy or sell our securities, and the price of our \nsecurities could suffer further significant decline. Delisting may also impair our ability to raise capital and harm our reputation. \nIf securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their \nrecommendations regarding the ADSs, the market price for the ADSs and trading volume could decline. \nThe trading market for the ADSs may be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our \nbusiness. If one or more analysts who cover us downgrade the ADSs, the market price for the ADSs would likely decline. If one or more \nof these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in \nturn, could cause the market price or trading volume for the ADSs to decline. \nThe sale or perceived sale of substantial amounts of our ADSs or ordinary shares could adversely affect their market price. \nSales of substantial amounts of our ADSs in the public market, sales of our ordinary shares, or the perception that these sales \ncould occur, could adversely affect the market price of the ADSs and could materially impair our ability to raise capital through equity \nofferings in the future. Ordinary shares held by our pre-IPO shareholders may be sold in the public market subject to the restrictions in \nRule 144 under the Securities Act. In addition, ordinary shares issued pursuant to our share incentive plans are eligible for sale in the \npublic market subject to restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act or through registration under the Securities Act, as applicable. \nIn addition, we have granted certain shareholders Form F-3 registration rights and the piggyback registration rights. Registration of these \nshares under the Securities Act may result in these shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act \nimmediately upon the effectiveness of the registration. Any market sales of securities held by our significant shareholders or any other \nshareholder may have an adverse impact on the market price of the ADSs. \n Our articles of association contain anti-takeover provisions that could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of our \nordinary shares and ADSs. \nOur currently effective fourth amended and restated articles of association contain provisions to limit the ability of others to \nacquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions. These provisions could have the effect of \ndepriving our shareholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties \nfrom seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. For example, our board of directors has the \nauthority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix their designations, powers, \npreferences, privileges, and relative participating, optional or special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, including \ndividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater \nthan the rights associated with our ordinary shares, represented by ADSs or otherwise. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with \nterms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. If our board of \ndirectors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of the ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary \nshares and the ADSs may be materially and adversely affected. \nAs a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate \ngovernance matters that differ significantly from the NYSE corporate governance rules; these practices may afford less protection \nto shareholders than they would enjoy if we comply fully with the NYSE corporate governance rules. In addition, we are also a \nforeign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions \napplicable to U.S. domestic public companies. \nThe NYSE corporate governance rules permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its \nhome country. Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from \nthe NYSE corporate governance rules. Currently, we rely on home country practice exemption with respect to the requirements for an \naudit committee composed of at least three members, annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, shareholder approval of equity-compensation plans \nand a majority of independent directors. We obtained the board approval but not shareholder approval for adopting the 2023 Plan, and \ndid not hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in 2023. As we rely on the home country practice exemption as described above, our \ninvestors may have less protection afforded to shareholders of companies that fully comply with NYSE corporate governance \nrequirements. We may also opt to rely on additional home country practice exemptions in the future.\nFurthermore, because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \nExchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. public companies, including (i) \n\n\n52\nbusiness. Even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, \nwill depend on, among other things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of \ndistributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed \nrelevant by our board of directors. \nAccordingly, the return on your investment in the ADSs will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of the \nADSs. There is no guarantee that the ADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased the ADSs. You \nmay not realize a return on your investment in the ADSs and you may even lose your entire investment in the ADSs. \nYou may not receive dividends or other distributions on our Class A ordinary shares and you may not receive any value for them, if \nit is illegal or impractical to make them available to you. \nThe depositary of the ADSs has agreed to pay to you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on Class \nA ordinary shares or other deposited securities underlying the ADSs, after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these \ndistributions in proportion to the number of Class A ordinary shares your ADSs represent. However, the depositary is not responsible if \nit decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would be unlawful \nto make a distribution to a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities Act but that are not \nproperly registered or distributed under an applicable exemption from registration. The depositary may also determine that it is not \nfeasible to distribute certain property through the mail. Additionally, the value of certain distributions may be less than the cost of \nmailing them. In these cases, the depositary may determine not to distribute such property. We have no obligation to register under U.S. \nsecurities laws any ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or other securities received through such distributions. We also have no obligation to \ntake any other action to permit the distribution of ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of ADSs. This means that \nyou may not receive distributions we make on our Class A ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to \nmake them available to you. These restrictions may cause a material decline in the value of the ADSs. \nYou may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings. \nWe may, from time to time, distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under the deposit \nagreement, the depositary will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to \nwhich these rights relate are either exempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs, or are registered \nunder the provisions of the Securities Act. The depositary may, but is not required to, attempt to sell these undistributed rights to third \nparties, and may allow the rights to lapse. We may be unable to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and \nwe are under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to these rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to have a \nregistration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights offerings and may \nexperience dilution of their holdings as a result. \nOur dual-class voting structure will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and could discourage others from pursuing any \nchange of control transactions that holders of our Class A ordinary shares and the ADSs may view as beneficial. \nOur ordinary shares are divided into Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Holders of Class A ordinary shares are \nentitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to ten votes per share. Each Class B ordinary share \nis convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time by the holder thereof, while Class A ordinary shares are not convertible into \nClass B ordinary shares under any circumstances. Save for certain limited exceptions, upon any transfer of Class B ordinary shares by \na holder thereof to any person or entity which is not an affiliate of such holder, such Class B ordinary shares shall be automatically and \nimmediately converted into the equal number of Class A ordinary shares. All of the ordinary shares held by our shareholders prior to \nthe completion of the initial public offering were re-designated as Class B ordinary shares upon completion of the offering. Kingsoft \nCorporation, one of our principal shareholders, and Mr. Sheng Fu, directly or through their holding vehicles, beneficially own an \naggregate of 53.8% of our total outstanding shares, representing 72.7% of our total voting power as of March 31, 2024, which give them \nconsiderable influence over matters requiring shareholders\u2019 approval, including election of directors and significant corporate \ntransactions, such as a merger or sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate \nmatters and could discourage others from pursuing any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that holders \nof Class A ordinary shares and ADSs may view as beneficial. \n You may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs. \nYour ADSs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary may close its books at any time or from time \nto time when it deems expedient in connection with the performance of its duties. The depositary may close its books from time to time \nfor a number of reasons, including in connection with corporate events such as a rights offering, during which time the depositary needs \nto maintain an exact number of ADSs on its books for a specified period. The depositary may also close its books in emergencies, and \non weekends and public holidays.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk \nForeign Exchange Risk \nOur revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in RMB or U.S. dollar. We do not believe that we currently have any \nsignificant direct foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk. Although \nour exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited in general, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be affected by the \nexchange rate between U.S. dollar and Renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in RMB, while our ADSs \nwill be traded in U.S. dollars. \nThe conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People\u2019s Bank of China. \nThe Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces \nor PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. \nTo the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. \ndollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert Renminbi \ninto U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, \nappreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amounts available to us. \nInterest Rate Risk \nOur exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to interest income generated by excess cash, which is mainly held in interest-\nbearing bank deposits, loans and interest expense generated from certain bank loans. We generated interest income of RMB25.4 million, \nRMB35.7 million and RMB62.0 million (US$8.7 million), and interest expense of nil , nil and RMB1.1 million (US$0.2 million), for \nthe years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We \nhave not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in market interest rates. However, our \nfuture interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market interest rates. \nMarket Price Risk \nWe are exposed to market price risk primarily with respect to investment securities held by us which are reported at fair value. A \nsubstantial portion of our investment in equity investees are held for long-term appreciation or for strategic purposes. And are accounted \nfor under equity method or measurement alternative and not subject to market price risk. We are also exposed to commodity price risk \nin our AI business as increase of component price may in turn increase our cost in robots sales and operations. \nItem 12.

(a) Consider the five\nvisual stimuli from Fig. 2.1, whose representation in a visual cortical area can\nbe characterized by its representational geometry. If the response patterns are all\naffected by isotropic noise (or the noise has been whitened by a transform), then the\nEuclidean distances monotonically reflect the discriminabilities. Variation among\nlarge distances, however, is not associated with great differences in discriminability,\nbecause all pairs of well-separated stimuli are nearly perfectly discriminable (dashed\nlines). Similarly, variation among very small distances is not associated with great\ndifferences in discriminability, because all pairs of neighboring stimuli are indis-\ncriminable (thick black edge). This suggests that variation among small distances\nand variation among large distances can be suppressed in favor of emphasizing the\ntransition from small to large distances. (b) To emphasize the transition from small\nto large distances while suppressing variation among small distances and variation\namong large distances, we can threshold the distances, such that small distances are\npushed to zero and large distances are pushed to the maximum. We can either use a\nhard threshold (upper row) or a soft threshold (lower row). A hard threshold yields\na binary matrix whose complement is the adjacency matrix of a graph that connects\nneighboring stimuli. A soft threshold creates a continuous transition, reflecting the\ngraded increase in discriminability as the distance grows, and defines a weighted\ngraph, where the weights reflect distances, but the pairs of stimuli that are furthest\nfrom each other are not directly connected (dashed lines in (a)).\n. . . . . . . . . .\n29\n2.3\nA family of geo-topological transforms of the RDM. (a) The geo-topological\n(GT) transform is formulated as a linear piecewise function, such that any distances\nsmaller than a lower bound l will be mapped to zero, and any distances bigger\nthan an upper bound u will be mapped to 1. Between l and u, the transition is\nlinear. (b) By varying the thresholds l and u, we select among a family of GT\ntransforms. (c) By applying different GT transforms to the RDM, we obtain so-\ncalled representational geo-topological matrices (RGTMs). (d) To interpret the way\nthe GT transforms reflect geometric and topological properties of the representation,\nwe group the family members in different zones of the plane spanned by l and u.\nThe closer a GT transform is to the upper left corner (l = 0, u = max), the more\nsimilar the RGTM is to the RDM. As we approach the diagonal line (l = u), the\nGT transform approaches a hard threshold, emphasizing the topology rather than\nthe geometry. As we move diagonally from the bottom left to the upper right, the\nRGTMs go from emphasizing the local neighbor relationships among the stimuli to\nemphasizing the global structure of the representation.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n31\n2.4\nModules and pipelines in RSAToolbox Python package.

In order to suppress noise, we would like to find a lower threshold l\nbelow which we consider stimuli as co-localized (i.e. the distance is 0). In order to abstract from\nidiosyncrasies of individual brains and highlight the representational properties that are key to their\ncomputational function, we would like to find an optimal upper distance threshold u above which\nwe consider stimuli maximally distinct (i.e. we do not consider differences between larger distances\nmeaningful). Two stimuli whose distance is larger than u are disconnected in the graph capturing\nthe topology.\nBetween the two thresholds we place a continuous transition so as to retain geometrical sensitiv-\nity in the range where it is meaningful (Fig. 2.3a). For simplicity, we propose a piecewise linear\nfunction as the monotonic distance transform. Note, however, that alternative monotonic transforms,\nsuch as the logistic function or a cosine transition, could be applied here. Given an original distance\ndi,j between the two neural signatures of two objects in the representational space, the piecewise\nlinear geo-topological (GT) transform is defined as:\nGTl,u(di,j) =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\nif di,j \u2264l\ndi,j\u2212l\nu\u2212l ,\nif l < di,j < u\n1,\nif u \u2264di,j\n(2.1)\n30\n\n\nFigure 2.3: A family of geo-topological transforms of the RDM. (a) The geo-topological (GT)\ntransform is formulated as a linear piecewise function, such that any distances smaller than a lower\nbound l will be mapped to zero, and any distances bigger than an upper bound u will be mapped to\n1. Between l and u, the transition is linear. (b) By varying the thresholds l and u, we select among a\nfamily of GT transforms. (c) By applying different GT transforms to the RDM, we obtain so-called\nrepresentational geo-topological matrices (RGTMs). (d) To interpret the way the GT transforms\nreflect geometric and topological properties of the representation, we group the family members\nin different zones of the plane spanned by l and u. The closer a GT transform is to the upper left\ncorner (l = 0, u = max), the more similar the RGTM is to the RDM. As we approach the diagonal\nline (l = u), the GT transform approaches a hard threshold, emphasizing the topology rather than\nthe geometry. As we move diagonally from the bottom left to the upper right, the RGTMs go from\nemphasizing the local neighbor relationships among the stimuli to emphasizing the global structure\nof the representation.\n31\n\n\nBy varying the lower bound l and upper bound u, we obtain a family of GT transforms (Fig.\n2.3b). Each member of this family transforms the original dissimilarity matrix (RDM) into a\nrepresentational geo-topological matrix (RGTM), which provides a multivariate summary statistic\nwith particular degrees of topological and geometrical sensitivity (Fig. 2.3c). The RGTM replaces\nthe RDM in topological RSA. Note that the RDM is itself a member of the family, where l = 0 and\nu is set to the maximum (upper left corner in Fig. 2.3b, c, d). The RGTM, thus, generalizes the\nRDM.\nWhen applying topological RSA to neural data to understand a brain representation, we can\nbenefit from considering not only the RDM, but also other members of the RGTM family to gain\nan understanding of the geometrical and topological features of a brain representation. For the\nparticular purpose of model selection, we aim to choose thresholds l and u, so as to best recover the\ntrue (data-generating) model representation if it is among our models, or the best approximation\namong the models we are testing.\n2.2.2\nGeo-topological descriptor family captures both geometric and multi-scale topological\ninformation\nFor interpretation of the family of GT transforms, we can consider the two diagonal dimensions\nof the triangular set spanned by l and u (Fig. 2.3d): From the upper left corner (RDM) toward\nthe lower right, we go from geometrical to topological sensitivity, approaching the thresholding\ntransforms (l = u) along the diagonal. From the lower left to the upper right, we go from local to\nglobal distance sensitivity.\nFor instance, the original RDM is in the top left corner (l = 0, u = 1), and around it, we have\na region of RGTMs that is geometry-sensitive where l is small and u is big. On the bottom left\ncorner, where both l and u are small, we have local extractors, which are RGTMs that are sensitive\nto whether or not two items are very close neighbors. On the upper right corner, where both l and u\nare big, we have global extractors, which are RGTMs that are sensitive to whether or not two items\nare on opposite ends of the ensemble. If we go along the diagonal line from lower left to upper\n32\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Geo-Topological (GT) Transforms in AGTDM. (a) Similar to the GT Transforms in\ntRSA, to discard geometrical information that is either not meaningful or unreliable, we subject\neach distance di,j for stimuli i and j to a monotonic transform GTl,u(di,j). (b) We refer to this\nfamily of transforms as geo-topological, because it combines aspects of geometry and topology.\n(c) Depending on the choice of a lower and upper bound, the transform can threshold (l = u) at an\narbitrary level, adapting to the granularity of a data set. It can also preserve all (l = 0, u = max) or\nsome (l < u) geometrical information. (d) monotonically transformed distance matrices under a set\nof threshold pairs.\nFrom a data-analytical perspective, conversely, small distances may be unreliable given the\nvarious noise sources that may affect the measurements. From both theoretical and data-analytical\nperspectives, it seems possible that focusing our sensitivity on a particular range of distances turns\nout to be advantageous because is reduces the influence of noise and/or arbitrary variability (e.g., of\nthe global geometry) that does not reflect dependency function. In order to suppress these noise,\nwe would like to find a lower distance threshold l below which we consider certain data points as\nco-localized (i.e., the points have collapsed into the same node in the graph). Between the two\nthresholds we place a continuous linear transition to retain some geometrical sensitivity in the range\nwhere it matters, as in Fig. 4.2. This formulation encapsulates the special case of full geometry:\none possibility is that the ideal setting is l = 0, u = max, i.e., the original distances.\nThe novel contribution is the idea to extract the geometry and topology from pairwise distances\nfor independence testing. In the following sections, we introduce AGTDM, an attractive adaptive\ndependence measure, and the empirical merit of its robust power to detect different kinds of\nstatistical dependency.\n63\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does varying the lower bound l and upper bound u in the geo-topological (GT) transform affect the balance between geometric and topological sensitivity in the resulting representational geo-topological matrices (RGTMs)?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/255156f0901ba6096dffccec11a54691.png", "data/qwen_images/75f8bc3802d9a9d4dd8db8e9c1964147.png"]}

Relative Representations\n23\n4.2\nRelative Representations\nAssumption.\nIn this Chapter, we make the core assumption that T is the class of\ntransformations that preserve the norm of the angles between elements of the latent\nspace, namely |\u2220(e\nxi, e\nxj)| = |\u2220(T e\nxi, T e\nxj)| for every (xi, xj) \u2208X. By \u201cangle norm\u201d,\nwe mean the absolute value of the angle between two elements, which ensures that\nglobal reflections do not change the sign of the considered similarity. While this\nassumption might seem too restrictive, in practice it arises in several real scenarios, as\nwe show in the following sections. Indeed, in classification tasks, this assumption is\nfurther supported by Figures B.6 and B.7 which show that the embeddings scale does\nnot affect classification performance. Therefore, only the angle between embeddings\nis relevant. Additionally, in Chapter 7, we completely remove this assumption.\nMethod.\nTo build our representation, we start by selecting a subset A of the training\ndata X, which we denote as anchors. Every sample in the training distribution will\nbe represented with respect to the embedded anchors e\naj = E(aj) with aj \u2208A. As\na measure capturing the relation between the anchors and the other samples, we\nconsider a generic similarity function d : Rd \u00d7 Rd \u2192R, yielding a scalar score\nbetween two absolute representations d(e\nxi, e\nxj). Given the anchors A in an arbitrary\nordering a1, . . . , a|A|, we define the RR of xi \u2208X as:\nrxi = (d(e\nxi, e\na1), d(e\nxi, e\na2), . . . , d(e\nxi, e\na|A|)) ,\n(4.1)\nfor convenience, we equivalently define the relative projection function Rp:\nRp(e\nx; e\nA, d) =\nM\ne\nai\u2208e\nA\nd(e\nx, e\nai)\n(4.2)\nwhere L denotes row-wise concatenation and all embeddings are produced by\nthe same encoding function E. For notational convenience, we denote the relative\nprojection of a set of samples e\nX with Rp( e\nX; e\nA, d), which is defined as the collection\nof relative projections of individual samples e\nx \u2208e\nX. Figure 4.2 illustrates the key\ndifferences between absolute and RRs.\nChoice of the anchors.\nAnchors directly affect the expressivity of the RR space, and\nare related to the task at hand. For example, in a classification task, we should sample\nanchors from each class in the training set, in order to well represent each data sample\nin X. We refer to Appendix A.1 for an analysis of different anchor selection strategies.\nParallel anchors.\nOne case of interest arises when the data comes from different\ndomains or modalities X \u0338= Y, and we are given a partial correspondence \u03c0, as\ndefined in Section 3.1. In this case, we can obtain parallel anchors2 by sampling\nsimultaneously from both domains X and Y:\nAXY \u2286\u03c0\n(4.3)\nWe show an example of parallel anchors in Section 4.4.2, where X and Y are Amazon\nreviews in two different languages; illustrate a strategy to automatically expand\nthis correspondence in Chapter 8; and further explore a multimodal application\nin Section 9.1.\n2We use the term \u201cparallel\u201d to indicate they represent the same underlying meaning.\n\n\n53\nChapter 8\nLimited Semantic Correspondence\nBootstrapping Parallel Anchors for Relative Representations1\nThe previous Chapters 4, 5 and 7 presented potential solutions to solve\nthe LCP (Chapter 3). Nevertheless, they all rely on a certain amount of\nparallel anchors AXY \u2286\u03c0 to be given, which can be impractical to obtain\nin certain scenarios. To overcome this limitation, in this Chapter, we\npropose an optimization-based method to discover new parallel anchors\nfrom a limited known set \u039bXY, denoted as seed. Our approach expands\nthe semantic correspondence between different domains, enabling the\nsolution of the LCP in scenarios where it was previously not possible.\n8.1\nIntroduction\nThe previous Chapters presented potential solutions to solve the LCP, either by\nprojecting the latent manifold embeddings into a universal space U or by directly\napproximating a specific transformation T that relates \u03c6 e\nX( f\nMX) \u2286e\nX and \u03c6e\nY( f\nMY) \u2286\ne\nY. Nevertheless, they all rely on the existence of an abstract correspondence C,\nobservable directly in the input spaces through \u03c0 and provided in input as a certain\namount of parallel anchors AXY \u2286\u03c0. However, obtaining a sufficient number of\nparallel anchors in specific applications can be challenging or impossible, hindering\nthe use of the aforementioned methods.\nIn this Chapter, we focus on the scenario where only a very limited number of\nparallel anchors is available, denoted as seed \u039b, and we aim to expand this initial set\nthrough an AO (Anchor Optimization) process. Our method achieves competitive\nperformance in NLP and Vision domains while significantly reducing the number of\nrequired parallel anchors by one order of magnitude.\n8.2\nMethod\nIn this Section, we introduce an optimization procedure that reduces the required\nnumber of parallel anchors by one order of magnitude. This method does not\nrequire complete knowledge of AXY but only of few initial seed anchors, denoted\nas \u039bXY \u2286AXY, where |\u039b| \u226a|AXY|. With no prior knowledge of AY, we initialize\nthe optimization process by approximating its embeddings e\nAY with the known\nseed embeddings: e\n\u039bY = L\na\u2208\u039bY EY(a), where L denotes row-wise concatenation,\n1Irene Cannistraci, Luca Moschella, Valentino Maiorca, Marco Fumero, Antonio Norelli, and\nEmanuele Rodol\u00e0 (2023). \u201cBootstrapping Parallel Anchors for Relative Representations\u201d.

WIS, designed to maintain the ability of a\nGNN to model interactions between input vertices, is compared against: (i) removing edges uniformly\nat random; (ii) a spectral sparsification method [198]; and (iii) an adaptation of UGS [39]. For Cora,\nwe run both 2-WIS, which is compatible with the GNN\u2019s depth, and 1-WIS, which can be viewed\nas an approximation that admits a particularly efficient implementation (Algorithm 2). For DBLP\nand OGBN-ArXiv, due to their larger scale only 1-WIS is evaluated. Markers and error bars report\nmeans and standard deviations, respectively, taken over ten runs per configuration. Note that 1-WIS\nachieves results similar to 2-WIS, suggesting that the efficiency it brings does not come at a significant\ncost in performance.

We also considered, but\nexcluded, the following datasets in which the accuracy difference was insignificant\n(less than five percentage points): Citeseer [190], PubMed [163], Coauthor CS and\nPhysics [194], and Amazon Photo [194].\nUsing depth L = 3 GNNs (with ReLU non-linearity), we evaluate over the Cora\n\n\n65\ndataset both 2-WIS, which is compatible with the GNNs\u2019 depth, and 1-WIS, which\ncan be viewed as an efficient approximation. Over the DBLP and OGBN-ArXiv\ndatasets, due to their larger scale only 1-WIS is evaluated. Figure 5.3 (and Figure D.5\nin Appendix D.6) shows that WIS significantly outperforms the following alternative\nmethods in terms of induced prediction accuracy: (i) a baseline in which edges are\nremoved uniformly at random; (ii) a well-known spectral algorithm [198] designed to\npreserve the spectrum of the sparsified graph\u2019s Laplacian; and (iii) an adaptation of\nUGS [39] \u2014 a recent supervised approach for learning to prune edges.11 Both 2-WIS\nand 1-WIS lead to higher test accuracies, while (as opposed to UGS) avoiding the\nneed for labels, and for training a GNN over the original (non-sparsified) graph \u2014 a\nprocedure which in some settings is prohibitively expensive in terms of runtime\nand memory. Interestingly, 1-WIS performs similarly to 2-WIS, indicating that the\nefficiency it brings does not come at a sizable cost in performance.\n11UGS [39] jointly prunes input graph edges and GNN weights. For fair comparison, we adapt it to\nonly remove edges.\n\n\n178\nFigure D.5: Comparison of GNN accuracies following sparsification of input edges \u2014 WIS, the edge\nsparsification algorithm brought forth by our theory (Algorithm 1), markedly outperforms alternative\nmethods. This figure supplements Figure 5.3 from Section 5.5.2 by including experiments with: (i) a\ndepth L = 3 GIN over the Cora, DBLP, and OGBN-ArXiv datasets; (ii) a depth L = 10 ResGCN over the\nCora, DBLP, and OGBN-ArXiv datasets; and (iii) a depth L = 3 GCN over the Chameleon, Squirrel, and\nAmazon Computers datasets. Markers and error bars report means and standard deviations, respec-\ntively, taken over ten runs per configuration for GCN and GIN, and over five runs per configuration\nfor ResGCN (we use fewer runs due to the larger size of ResGCN). For further details see caption\nof Figure 5.3 as well as Appendix D.6.2.\nimprove by at least 0.01 over 1000 consecutive epochs or 10000 epochs elapsed.\nThe learning rates used for GCN, GAT, and GIN were 5 \u00b7 10\u22123, 5 \u00b7 10\u22123, and 10\u22122,\nrespectively.\nHyperparameter tuning. For each model separately, to tune the learning rate we\ncarried out five runs (differing in random seed) with every value in the range {10\u22121, 5 \u00b7\n10\u22122, 10\u22122, 5 \u00b7 10\u22123, 10\u22123} over the dataset whose essential partition has low walk\nindex. Since our interest resides in expressiveness, which manifests in ability to fit\nthe training set, for every model we chose the learning rate that led to the highest\nmean train accuracy.\nD.6.2.2\nEdge Sparsification (Figures 5.3 and D.5)\nAdaptations to UGS [39]. [39] proposed UGS as a framework for jointly pruning\ninput graph edges and weights of a GNN. At a high-level, UGS trains two differen-\ntiable masks, mg and m\u03b8, that are multiplied with the graph adjacency matrix and the\nGNN\u2019s weights, respectively. Then, after a certain number of optimization steps, a\n\n\n179\npredefined percentage pg of graph edges are removed according to the magnitudes\nof entries in mg, and similarly, p\u03b8 percent of the GNN\u2019s weights are fixed to zero\naccording to the magnitudes of entries in m\u03b8. This procedure continues in iterations,\nwhere each time the remaining GNN weights are rewinded to their initial values,\nuntil the desired sparsity levels are attained \u2014 see Algorithms 1 and 2 in [39]. To\nfacilitate a fair comparison of our (L \u22121)-WIS edge sparsification algorithm with\nUGS, we make the following adaptations to UGS.\n\u2022 We adapt UGS to only remove edges, which is equivalent to fixing the entries in\nthe weight mask m\u03b8 to one and setting p\u03b8 = 0 in Algorithm 1 of [39].\n\u2022 For comparing performance across a wider range of sparsity levels, the number\nof edges removed at each iteration is changed from 5% of the current number of\nedges to 5% of the original number of edges.\n\u2022 Since our evaluation focuses on undirected graphs, we enforce the adjacency\nmatrix mask mg to be symmetric.\nSpectral sparsification [198]. For Cora and DBLP, we used a Python implementa-\ntion of the spectral sparsification algorithm from [198], based on the PyGSP library\nimplementation.1 To enable more efficient experimentation over the larger scale\nOGBN-ArXiv dataset, we used a Julia implementation based on that from the Lapla-\ncians library.2\nModels. The GCN and GIN models had three layers of width 64 with ReLU non-\nlinearity. As in the experiments of Section 5.4.3, we added layer normalization [12]\nafter each one. Every GIN layer had a trainable \u03f5 parameter and contained a two-\nlayer feed-forward network, whose layers comprised a linear layer, batch normal-\nization [105], and ReLU non-linearity. For ResGCN, we used the implementation\nfrom [39] with ten layers of width 64. In all models, a linear output layer was applied\nover the last hidden embeddings for prediction.\nData. All datasets in our evaluation are multi-class vertex prediction tasks, each\nconsisting of a single graph. In Cora, DBLP, and OGBN-ArXiv, vertices represent\nscientific publications and edges stand for citation links. In Chameleon and Squirrel,\nvertices represent web pages on Wikipedia and edges stand for mutual links between\npages. In Amazon Computers, vertices represent products and edges indicate that\ntwo products are frequently bought together. For simplicity, we treat all graphs\nas undirected. Table D.1 reports the number of vertices and undirected edges in\neach dataset. For all datasets, except OGBN-ArXiv, we randomly split the labels of\nvertices into train, validation, and test sets comprising 80%, 10%, and 10% of all labels,\nrespectively. For OGBN-ArXiv, we used the default split from [99].\nTable D.1: Graph size of each dataset used for comparing edge sparsification algorithms in Figures 5.3\nand D.5.\n# of Vertices\n# of Undirected Edges\nCora\n2,708\n5,278\nDBLP\n17,716\n52,867\nOGBN-ArXiv\n169,343\n1,157,799\nChameleon\n2,277\n31,396\nSquirrel\n5,201\n198,423\nAmazon Computers\n13,381\n245,861\n1See https://github.com/epfl-lts2/pygsp/.\n2See https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl.\n\n\n180\nTable D.2: Optimization hyperparameters used in the experiments of Figures 5.3 and D.5 per model and\ndataset.\nLearning Rate\nWeight Decay\nEdge Mask \u21131 Regularization of UGS\nGCN\nCora\n5 \u00b7 10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\nDBLP\n10\u22123\n10\u22124\n10\u22122\nOGBN-ArXiv\n10\u22123\n0\n10\u22122\nChameleon\n10\u22123\n10\u22124\n10\u22122\nSquirrel\n5 \u00b7 10\u22124\n0\n10\u22124\nAmazon Computers\n10\u22123\n10\u22124\n10\u22122\nGIN\nCora\n10\u22123\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\nDBLP\n10\u22123\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\nOGBN-ArXiv\n10\u22124\n0\n10\u22122\nResGCN\nCora\n5 \u00b7 10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22124\nDBLP\n5 \u00b7 10\u22124\n10\u22124\n10\u22124\nOGBN-ArXiv\n10\u22123\n0\n10\u22122\nOptimization. The cross-entropy loss was minimized via the Adam optimizer [121]\nwith default \u03b21, \u03b22 coefficients and full-batches (i.e. every batch contained the whole\ntraining set). Optimization proceeded until the validation accuracy did not improve\nby at least 0.01 over 1000 consecutive epochs or 10000 epochs elapsed. The test\naccuracies reported in Figure 5.3 are those achieved during the epochs with highest\nvalidation accuracies. Table D.2 specifies additional optimization hyperparameters.\nHyperparameter tuning. For each combination of model and dataset separately,\nwe tuned the learning rate, weight decay coefficient, and edge mask \u21131 regulariza-\ntion coefficient for UGS, and applied the chosen values for evaluating all methods\nwithout further tuning (note that the edge mask \u21131 regularization coefficient is rel-\nevant only for UGS). In particular, we carried out a grid search over learning rates\n{10\u22123, 5 \u00b7 10\u22124, 10\u22124}, weight decay coefficients {10\u22123, 10\u22124, 0}, and edge mask \u21131\nregularization coefficients {10\u22122, 10\u22123, 10\u22124}. Per hyperparameter configuration, we\nran ten repetitions of UGS (differing in random seed), each until all of the input\ngraph\u2019s edges were removed. At every edge sparsity level (0%, 5%, 10%, . . . , 100%),\nin accordance with [39], we trained a new model with identical hyperparameters, but\na fixed edge mask, over each of the ten graphs. We chose the hyperparameters that\nled to the highest mean validation accuracy, taken over the sparsity levels and ten\nruns.\nDue to the size of the ResGCN model, tuning its hyperparameters entails significant\ncomputational costs. Thus, over the Cora and DBLP datasets, per hyperparameter\nconfiguration we ran five repetitions of UGS with ResGCN instead of ten. For the\nlarge-scale OGBN-ArXiv dataset, we adopted the same hyperparameters used for\nGCN.\nOther. To allow more efficient experimentation, we compute the edge removal order\nof 2-WIS (Algorithm 1) in batches of size 100. Specifically, at each iteration of 2-WIS,\ninstead of removing the edge e\u2032 with maximal walk index tuple s(e\u2032), the 100 edges\nwith largest walk index tuples are removed.

Fundamentals\n38\nSome successful sensor constellations for AINS are, e.g., loosely-coupled barometric\nfusion [15], tightly-coupled UWB-aided inertial odometry [61], tightly-coupled GNSS-aided\ninertial odometry [22], VIO [110], VINS [46], radar-aided inertial odometry [107], LIDAR-\naided inertial odometry [155], thermal camera-aided inertial odometry [33], loosely-coupled\nvisual inertial SLAM [150], and other multi-sensor based approaches, e.g., [18, 36, 58, 87].\nIn the following sections, we briefly describe the system- and sensor models used in the\nfilter-based aided INS for our evaluations. As the Jacobians in indirect filter formulations\ndepend on the error-state definition, it can be a laborious process to derive Jacobians.\nTherefore, we provide a generic set of Jacobians for our error definition (the type-1 error\nas discussed in Section 2.4.1) and filter formulations.\n2.9.1\nInertial Measurement Unit (IMU)\nAs state propagation sensor, an IMU is used to predict the position, velocity and orienta-\ntion based on noisy and biased accelerometer and gyroscope measurements.\nThe measured linear acceleration and angular velocity of the IMU\u2019s body, are assumed\nto be noisy and biased\n\u2110a# = \u2110a + (\ud835\udca2R\u2110)T\n\ud835\udca2g + \u2110ba + na = \u2110a + \u2110g + \u2110ba + na,\n(2.79a)\n\u2110\ud835\udf14# = \u2110\ud835\udf14+ \u2110b\ud835\udf14+ n\ud835\udf14,\n(2.79b)\nwith na \u223c\ud835\udca9(0, \u03a3a) and n\ud835\udf14\u223c\ud835\udca9(0, \u03a3\ud835\udf14). \u2110ba and \u2110b\ud835\udf14are the accelerometer and\ngyroscope biases, respectively.

We assume that the origin of both sensor, the\naccelerometer and gyroscope, coincide.\nWe assume that the additive white Gaussian noise on the IMU measurements is equal\non all three axes, meaning that the noise and perturbations are isotropic.

A1 receives global pose measurements, while A2 receives correction from joint relative\nposition measurements with A1, starting from \ud835\udc61= 5.05 s on.

Note:\nDCSE-DACC and DCSE-DAH should perform in this setup equivalently. Due to random\nnoise on measurements a slight deviation is given. Adapted from [76].\n3.5.2\nScalability of DCSE algorithms for Aided Inertial Navigation\nThe main motivation of the proposed DCSE-DAH approach is to reduce the maintenance\neffort for estimators with high propagation and update rates, as extension to DCSE-DACC.\nThe following evaluation is adapted from our evaluation conducted in [76]. In simulation\nwith 20 agents arranged in a circle, we compare different DCSE fusion techniques, as shown\nin Figure 3.13. Each performs a unique take-off (altitude of 20 m, circle (diameter of 10 m,\nwith a height variation of \u00b12.5 m), and landing procedure. The duration of a trajectory is\n60 s.\nThe problem formulation and assumptions made, are identical to those of the previous\nevaluation, see Section 3.5.1.\nTo stress the maintenance effort, each agent observes relative position measurements\nwith three other agents (counter clock-wise on the formed circle), as shown in the measure-\nment activity on agent A1 in Figure 3.15. Thus, each agent know/met in total six other\nagents and all agents are directly correlated or indirectly correlated through others. A quar-\nter of the agents are provided with noisy absolute IMU position measurements, meaning\nthat 14 agents rely on IMU and relative IMU position measurements only. The absolute\nposition update is received at a rate of 10 Hz, with a standard deviation of \ud835\udf0eabs = 0.3 m,\nfrom \ud835\udc61= 0.1 s on, and with a random message drop rate of 20 %. Local relative position\nobservations are obtained at a rate of 10 Hz, with \ud835\udf0erel = 0.1 m, and a random message\ndrop rate of 60 %. All receive unbiased and very noisy IMU measurements at 200 Hz with\na standard deviation of \ud835\udf0eacc = 0.01 m/s2 and \ud835\udf0egyr = 0.01 rad/s for the accelerometer and\ngyroscope, respectively. All measurements are generated from the ground truth trajectory.\nAll agent\u2019s states are initialized correctly with a reasonable uncertainty. The size of the\ncorrection buffer \u212cwas set to 100 elements, which corresponds to a time horizon of 0.5 s.\nFigure 3.16 and Table 3.5 show that DCSE-DAH outperforms DCSE-DACC in terms\nof total execution time. Using DCSE-DAH, the execution time of the estimator was in\ntotal 7.87 s, while using DCSE-DACC, it was 11.26 s which is\n43 % slower. It can also\nbe seen, that the processing time of joint observations are in DCSE-DAH approximately\n33 % higher as in DCSE-DACC. Concluding, DCSE-DAH keeps constant maintenance\ncomplexity for propagation and private filter steps, if the buffer size satisfies the period\nof joint observations. The estimation performance of DCSE-DAH seems to be a bit worse\nthan DCSE-DACC, despite there should be no difference . Figure 3.14 shows a snapshot\nat \ud835\udc61= 8.5 s of the simulation performing DCSE-DAH.\n\n\n4. Filter-based Modular Multi-Sensor Fusion\n109\n4.4\nEvaluation\nThe experiments are done in our custom MATLAB framework, that allows to load real\ndata from the EuRoC dataset [20] by Burri et al. , as shown in Figure 4.2. Exteroceptive\nmeasurements (private or joint observations) are generated based on the ground truth\ntrajectory modified by the sensors\u2019 calibration states and noise parameters. The noisy and\nbiased real-world IMU samples provided by the datasets are used without modifications.\nFinally, all measurements are processed in the instance handler H. It is maintaining multi-\nple IKF instances/nodes S, while communication between instances is handled locally. The\nfilter instances and handler support different fusion strategies as listed in Section 4.4.1.\nFor the scalability and accuracy evaluation, we add different exteroceptive sensors to\na modular ESEKF using an IMU as propagation sensor. The sensor suite\u2019s state vector\nmight consist of a varying number of (i) absolute position sensors, e.g., a GNSS sensor,\n(ii) a barometers, (iii) an atmospheric sensors (ATM):\nx\u2110=\n[\ufe01\n\ud835\udca2\n\ud835\udca2p\u2110, \ud835\udca2\n\ud835\udca2v\u2110, \ud835\udca2q\u2110, \u2110b\ud835\udf14, \u2110b\ud835\udc4e\n]\ufe01\n(4.1)\nx{\ud835\udc9c\u212c\ud835\udcae,\u212c\ud835\udc9c\u211b\ud835\udcaa} =\n[\ufe01\n\u212c\n\u212cp\ud835\udcae\n]\ufe01\n(4.2)\nx\ud835\udc9c\ud835\udcaf\u2133= [\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a]\n(4.3)\nwith \ud835\udca2\n\ud835\udca2p\u2110, \ud835\udca2\n\ud835\udca2v\u2110, and \ud835\udca2q\u2110as the position, velocity and orientation of the IMU \u2110referring to\nthe global frame \ud835\udca2. \u2110b\ud835\udf14and \u2110b\ud835\udc4eare the estimated gyroscope and accelerometer biases to\ncorrect the related IMU readings. \u212c\n\u212cp\u2110and \u212cq\u2110as constant position and orientation of the\nIMU \u2110referring to the body frame \u212c.

The evaluation is performed single-threaded in MATLAB\non an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU with a 32 GB DDR4 RAM.\n4.4.1\nStrategy Overview\nWe ported different CSE strategies to a MMSF formulation with support for delayed\nmeasurements: Centralized equivalent (MMSF-C), decoupled propagation (MMSF-DP),\ndecoupled approximated cross-covariance (MMSF-DACC) and tested them as well as a\nstate-of-the-art native modular approach (MMSF-MaRS) against our here proposed de-\ncoupled approximated history (MMSF-DAH) approach.\n1. MMSF-C: Modularized, but centralized equivalent implementation and corresponds\nto CCSE (see Section 3.4.2).\n2. MMSF-DP: Using the cross-covariance factorization proposed by Roumeliotis and\nBekey [121], allowing decoupled propagation. Observations are performed on the full\nstate thus it corresponds to DCSE-DP* (see Section 3.4.4).\n3. MMSF-MaRS: Decoupled on-demand propagation of cross-covariance factors using a\nbuffer for \u03a6. Originally, it is considering just cross-covariance between a core sensor\nand other sensors. Missing interdependencies between sensors and missing correction\nterms may lead to invalid joint covariances, which are then corrected by different\nEigenvalue correction strategies as described by Brommer et al. in [18].\n4. MMSF-DACC: Like MMSF-DP with approximations proposed by Luft et al. [95]\ndirectly applied on cross-covariance factors, to perform observation isolated and cor-\nresponds to DCSE-DACC (see Section 3.4.5).\n\n\n5. Filter-based Modular Ultra-Wideband Aided Inertial Navigation\n129\nT-A ranging\nIn this experiment, IMU and T-A measurements are fused in the modular estimator frame-\nwork using three different fusion strategies. The effective T-A measurement rate for each\nanchor is 2 Hz due to the Round Robin scheduling performed. As shown in Table 5.2,\nMMSF-DAH is the fastest approach that allows to significantly reduce the total filter\nexecution time by a factor of 22.3 and a factor of 15.6 over MMSF-C and MMSF-DP, re-\nspectively. MMSF-DAH seems to be slightly more confident than the other two approaches\nand the ANEES converges slower to the desired mean value. Nonetheless, the ANEES plots\nof the weakly observable accelerometer bias b\ud835\udc4e, the IMU orientation \ud835\udca2q\u2110, and the position\nof the sixth (as a representative and also random choice for space reasons) anchor \ud835\udca2p\ud835\udc9c6 for\nall strategies shown in Figure 5.4, behave similarly. Summarized, the ARMSE of anchor\npositions reduced from an initial RMSE of 30 cm (see Table 5.1) below to approximately\n12 cm on average over the entire trajectory using either fusion strategy in Table 5.2.\nT-A and A-A ranging\nIn this experiment, IMU, T-A and A-A range measurements were fused using MMSF-DP\nand MMSF-DAH. MMSF-C was excluded due to the huge single run computation time.\nThe effective T-A and A-A measurement rate for each device is 1 Hz due to the time\nscheduling performed to avoid network congestion. As shown in Table 5.2, MMSF-DAH is\n21.8 times faster then MMSF-DP. It can be clearly seen in the same table, that A-A range\nmeasurements significantly reduce the estimation error of the anchor positions down to\n1.6 cm. The inclusion of these measurements comes at the cost of higher complexity, leading\nto 5.6 times higher computation time in the case of MMSF-DAH. This could motivate to\nperform a two-stage approach: first, performing an accurate anchor localization, then once\nthe system is calibrated, only highly efficient T-A measurements are performed.\nIn Figure 5.5, the ANEES of the accelerometer bias, the 17th anchor position \ud835\udc9c17\nand the 19th anchor position \ud835\udc9c19 is shown. Interestingly, the A-A measurements have a\npositive impact on the ANEES of the accelerometer bias, and it also seems to converge\nfaster, compared to the T-A-only experiment. The ANEES of the 17th and 19th anchor are\nchosen as they show both under-confidence and over-confidence, which is independent of\nthe selected fusion strategy. Apart from a position/constellation related dependency issue\ndue to PDOP, the major impact stems form lacking observability in areas with no direct\nlink to fixed anchors. Nonetheless, the state plots in Figure 5.6 of the first Monte Carlo\nsimulation run using MMSF-DAH, show an exemplary and satisfying estimation behavior\nof the navigation states, while the estimated anchor position \ud835\udc9c19 is not converging, as it\nis not globally observable as discussed later in Section 7.5.4.\nT-A and pressure\nIn this experiment, we evaluate the impact of fusing pressure readings of a rigidly at-\ntached barometer loosely coupled in the modular estimation framework using MMSF-DP\nand MMSF-DAH. The calibration state between the barometer and the body reference\nframe are assumed to be known a-priori and are fixed. Pressure readings are processed\nat a rate of 20 Hz with measurement standard deviation of \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udcab= 1 Pa, translating to ap-\nproximately 8.4 cm standard deviation at sea-level and is slightly beyond commercially\nintegrated pressure sensors. Again, 10 % of pressure readings are dropped randomly. As\nshown in Table 5.2, MMSF-DAH is again 21.8 times faster as MMSF-DP. Fusing pressure\nreading tightly leads to more accurate IMU estimate in case of MMSF-DP than fusing\nA-A measurements. Interestingly, the pressure readings are not improving the anchor po-\nsition estimates across approaches and is subject to future investigations. In Figure 5.5, the\nANEES of the accelerometer bias, the 7th and 18th UWB anchor are depicted, indicating\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Given the isotopic sensor noise characteristics outlined in Table 3.3, if an engineer wanted to improve the system's accuracy in estimating the orientation, should they prioritize reducing the noise in the accelerometer or the gyroscope, and why?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/af10862fe36d431083c69976d8b34cb2.png", "data/qwen_images/c6f55c69fd30180d67bb863e8e3f2a00.png", "data/qwen_images/61791f52a02609b9a9527018a1d6d088.png", "data/qwen_images/c7f0c37f42b7b381093b7830204a22d3.png", "data/qwen_images/4914e191147811032d2ba862a3a552ed.png"]}

As a consequence, the prices we \nreceive for crude oil and our heavier liquid products move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it \nreacts to supply and demand factors. \nThe prices of our lighter liquid products move up and down independently of \nany relationship between the crude oil and natural gas markets. \nTransportation costs related to moving crude oil and \nliquids are also generally deducted from the price received for crude oil and liquids.\nOur natural gas is sold under both long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas \nproduced by us is sold at various delivery points to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated \nmidstream companies. \nThe prices we receive are calculated based on various pipeline indices. When there is an \nopportunity to do so, we may have our natural gas processed at San Mateo\u2019s, Pronto\u2019s or third parties\u2019 processing \nfacilities to extract liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas. We are then paid for the extracted NGLs based on \neither a negotiated percentage of the proceeds that are generated from the sale of NGLs or other negotiated pricing \narrangements using then-current market pricing less fixed rate processing, transportation and fractionation fees.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production fluctuate widely. Factors that, directly or \nindirectly, cause price fluctuations include, but are not limited to: the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand \nfor, oil, natural gas and NGLs; the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and certain \nother oil-exporting countries (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) and state-controlled oil companies; the prices and availability of competitors\u2019 \nsupplies of oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; the impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates; \ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts; \nthe availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing and transportation systems for oil, natural gas  \nand NGLs and gathering and disposal systems for produced water; the availability of refining capacity; the prices and \navailability of alternative fuel sources; weather conditions and natural disasters, including hurricanes and tropical \nstorms in the Gulf Coast region and severe cold weather in the Delaware Basin; political conditions or conflicts in or \naffecting oil and natural gas producing regions or countries, including the United States, the Middle East, South \nAmerica, Russia, Ukraine and China; the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and \n\n\n50\t\n\t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \nFORM 10-K PART I\nDeclines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices not only reduce our revenue, but could also reduce the amount of oil, \nnatural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our \nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves and our ability to comply with the financial \ncovenants under our Credit Agreement. Should oil, natural gas or NGL prices decrease to economically unattractive \nlevels and remain there for an extended period of time, we may elect to delay some of our exploration and \ndevelopment plans for our prospects, cease exploration or development activities on certain prospects due to the \nanticipated unfavorable economics from such activities or cease or delay further expansion of our midstream \nprojects, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations \nand reserves. In addition, such declines in commodity prices could cause a reduction in our borrowing base. If the \nborrowing base were to be less than the outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement at any time, we would \nbe required to provide additional collateral satisfactory in nature and value to the lenders to increase the borrowing \nbase to an amount sufficient to cover such excess or repay the deficit in equal installments over a period of six months.\nOur industry and the broader U.S. economy have experienced higher than expected inflationary pressures \nin recent years related to increases in oil and natural gas prices, continued supply chain disruptions, labor \nshortages and geopolitical instability, among other pressures. Should these conditions persist, it may \nimpact our ability to procure services, materials and equipment on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and, as a \nresult, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and \nadversely affected.\nInflation in the U.S. has become much more significant in recent years. \nThroughout 2022 and 2023, we \nexperienced significant increases in the costs of certain oilfield services, materials and equipment, including diesel, \nsteel, labor, trucking, sand, personnel and completion costs, among others, as a result of the recent increases in oil \nand natural gas prices, as well as availability constraints, supply chain disruptions, increased demand, labor shortages \nand wage increases associated with a low U.S unemployment rate, inflation and other factors. Supply and demand \nfundamentals have been aggravated by disruptions in global energy supply caused by multiple geopolitical events, \nincluding the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, as well as related actions \nof the U.S. and other governments and governmental organizations relating to oil, natural gas and NGLs, including \nthrough sanctions, embargoes, import restrictions and commodity price caps. Should oil and natural gas prices \nremain at their current levels or increase, we expect to be subject to additional supply chain constraints and service \ncost inflation in future periods, which may increase our costs to drill, complete, equip and operate wells. In addition, \nsupply chain disruptions and other inflationary pressures being experienced throughout the U.S. and global economy \nand in the oil and natural gas industry may limit our ability to procure the necessary products and services we need \nfor drilling, completing and producing wells in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in reduced \nmargins and delays to our operations and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict the impact of the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and \nHamas and the related humanitarian crises on the global economy, energy markets, geopolitical stability \nand our business.\nAlthough our leasehold acreage is located primarily in the Delaware Basin, the broader consequences of the \nconflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, \nsupply chain disruptions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, may have adverse effects on global macroeconomic \nconditions, increase volatility in the price and demand for oil and natural gas, increase exposure to cyberattacks, \ncause disruptions in global supply chains, increase foreign currency fluctuations, cause constraints or disruption in \nthe capital markets and limit sources of liquidity. We cannot predict the extent of either conflict\u2019s effect on our \nbusiness and results of operations as well as on the global economy and energy markets.\n\n\n112\t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY \nFORM 10-K PART II\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $110.9 million to $1.87 billion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2023, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.98 billion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022. Excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities, net cash provided by operating  \nactivities decreased to $1.82 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2.10 billion for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2022. \nThis decrease was primarily attributable to lower realized oil and natural gas prices for the year \nended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, which was partially offset by the \n25% increase in total oil equivalent production during 2023, as compared to 2022. Changes in our operating assets \nand liabilities between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 resulted in a net increase of approximately \n$168.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to \nthe year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur operating cash flows are sensitive to a number of variables, including changes in our production and the \nvolatility of oil and natural gas prices between reporting periods. Regional and worldwide economic activity, the actions \nof OPEC+ and other large state-controlled oil producers, weather, infrastructure capacity to reach markets and \nother variable factors significantly impact the prices of oil and natural gas. \nThese factors are beyond our control and \nare difficult to predict. From time to time, we use commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate our \nexposure to fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.

Low oil, natural gas and NGL prices and the continued volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial \ncondition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations.\n\u201d\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $2.17 billion to $3.21 billion for the year ended December 31, \n2023 from $1.04 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in net cash used in investing \nactivities was primarily due to (i) an increase between the periods of $1.68 billion in expenditures related to the \nAdvance Acquisition, (ii) an increase between the periods of $421.0 million in D/C/E capital expenditures primarily \nattributable to our operated and non-operated drilling, completion and equipping activities in the Delaware Basin  \nand (iii) an increase between the periods of $85.7 million in midstream capital expenditures. \nThese increases were \npartially offset by a decrease of $75.8 million related to the Pronto Acquisition in 2022.\nCash Flows Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $1.38 billion to $902.3 million for the year ended December 31, \n2023, from net cash used in financing activities of $480.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. During \nthe year ended December 31, 2023, our net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to  \n(i) proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes of $494.8 million, (ii) net borrowings under our Credit Agreement \nof $500.0 million and (iii) net borrowings under the San Mateo Credit Facility of $57.0 million, which were partially \noffset by (x) dividends paid of $77.2 million and (y) net distributions related to non-controlling interest owners of \nless-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries of $15.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our net cash used \nin financing activities was primarily attributable to (i) the repurchase of an aggregate principal of $350.8 million  \nof the 2026 Notes for $344.3 million, (ii) net repayments under our Credit Agreement of $100.0 million, (iii) net \ndistributions related to non-controlling interest owners of less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries of $57.7 million and \n(iv) dividends paid of $35.2 million, which were partially offset by net borrowings under the San Mateo Credit \nFacility of $80.0 million.\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for a summary of our debt, including \nthe Credit Agreement, the San Mateo Credit Facility, the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes.\n\n\n126\t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \nImpact of inflation.

The terrific re-up \nrate for Almanac\u2019s latest fund, Almanac Realty \nSecurities IX, indicates that clients appreciate \nour philosophy and recognize this opportunity. \nRelying on Our Strengths to \nSustain Investment Through \nVolatile Times\nAll of this suggests that tough times in the \neconomy are also often times of opportunity. So \nhow is our industry responding to the economic \nheadwinds of 2022 \u2013 23, and how is it preparing \nfor these opportunities?\nMost firms have responded to reduced revenues \n(and typically net outflows from clients) with \ncuts in headcount, office footprint, research data \ncosts, travel and compensation, likely spread \nacross 2022 and 2023.\nNB has chosen a different path, a luxury afforded \nby two fundamental attributes. \nClient support, evident in flows through both \n2021 and 2022, meant that our revenues grew by \n2% last year, despite the big drops in equity and \nbond markets.3 Making the top three in Barron\u2019s \n2022 Best Fund Family Rankings\u2014and taking \nthe top spot in the key U.S. Equity category\u2014is \none indicator of why clients continue to reward \nus with that valuable support. \nOur ownership structure is important, too. With \nno corporate parent and no external shareholder, \nwe can focus on the long term, building the \ncapabilities required to meet client objectives, \ndespite the tougher market conditions. We \ninvested in our people and in research and data \nscience in 2022, and continue to do so in 2023, \nas we believe those investments will enable us \nto outperform peers in the years ahead. It is why \nwe exist.\nOur headcount grew by 248 people, or 10%, \nglobally during 2022, and total compensation \nand benefits increased.

Our team\u2014led by established value investors Eli Salzmann and \nDavid Levine\u2014has 31 years of experience on average, and works closely \nwith the Neuberger Berman Global Equity Research Department. \nInvesting With Conviction\nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, an extended period of artificially low \ninterest rates tilted investor bias toward growth stocks with naturally \nlonger durations. Our team believes that the easy-money era is over and \nvalue-oriented stocks, with shorter durations, will play an increasingly \nimportant role in prudently diversified portfolios. \nOur disciplined investment philosophy is based on a blend of three core \ntenets (see chart on the next page):\n\u2022 \u0007\nNormalized earnings have historically been more effective than point-in-\ntime earnings as an indicator of long-term company health.\n\u2022 \u0007\nIndustries hampered by capacity constraints tend to face less competition, \nenhancing some companies\u2019 ability to earn better margins in future years.\n\u2022 \u0007\nWhile some stocks are cheap for a reason, emphasis on potential \ncatalysts\u2014such as new product launches, management changes and \ncorporate spinoffs\u2014can help avoid value traps.\nOur team also employs a combination of fundamental research, data \nscience and engagement with company management to uncover value \nthat, in our view, is not captured by financial characteristics alone. \nFinally, we believe that maintaining long-term investment horizons can \nhelp identify attractive investments by putting near-term anomalies into \nclearer perspective.\nThe Large Cap Value Team\nSPOTLIGHT\n\n\nNEUBERGER BERMAN ANNUAL REPORT \u2013 JUNE 2023\n28\nBringing Transparency and Accountability to \nProxy Voting\nIn 2020, we launched NB Votes, an advance proxy vote disclosure \ninitiative in which our firm announces our voting intentions in advance of \nthe annual general meetings (AGMs) of a select group of companies in \nwhich we invest on behalf of clients. Now in its third year, this program \nseeks to share our opinions and provide insight to our analysis by pre-\nannouncing our proxy-voting intentions on an array of voting topics that, \nwe believe, have material economic consequences for our clients. The \nprogram underscores our commitment to bringing more transparency into \nthe proxy voting decision-making process.\nNB Votes has three main goals:\n\u2022 \u0007\nEncourage companies in which we invest for our clients to improve their \ngovernance practices, thereby enhancing long-term value for our clients\n\u2022 \u0007\nImprove the transparency of our voting process\n\u2022 \u0007\nDemonstrate how our long-term, active-management approach drives \nour voting decisions \nMeeting those goals often means going against the grain. In 2022, we \nannounced our voting intentions on 63 key votes and sided against \nmanagement on 54% of them, compared with announcing 60 votes and \npushing back on 52% in 2021. In this latest proxy season, we focused \non proposals addressing a host of issues\u2014from board independence \nand ESG oversight, to incentive schemes and capital allocation\u2014that \nwe believe ultimately shape companies\u2019 long-term financial performance. \nAt Neuberger Berman, we believe sound corporate governance policies \nand transparent reporting are essential for navigating the cross-currents \nof this challenging economy. That is why we will continue to urge \ncompanies and their boards to embrace what we see as best practices \nthrough our NB Votes program, while also assessing our own ability to \nidentify the most salient issues and use our voice effectively.\nPre-announcement of proxy voting intentions may still not be common \npractice. Yet as an active manager with voting responsibility on behalf \nof our clients, we believe we are well positioned to continue serving \nour clients by being transparent in encouraging companies to raise their \ngovernance standards and enhance their financial performance.\nFor a full list of the votes disclosed as part of our NB Votes initiative in \n2022, please see our NB Votes website.\nOur Approach to \nProxy Voting\nWe believe that proxy voting is an integral aspect of active investment management. Many of our clients \nentrust us with the responsibility of proxy voting on their behalf, and we take that responsibility seriously. \nAccordingly, we believe proxy voting must be conducted with the same degree of prudence and loyalty \naccorded any fiduciary or other obligation of an investment manager. Neuberger Berman has developed \ncustom Proxy Voting Guidelines that comprehensively lay out our voting positions, including the potential \nfinancial impact on a company from corporate governance, environmental and social issues. These \nGuidelines are updated as deemed appropriate and reviewed at least on an annual basis. \n\n\nNEUBERGER BERMAN ANNUAL REPORT \u2013 JUNE 2023\n40\nAs an active manager, our purpose is to deliver compelling investment \nresults for our clients over the long term, supporting them to achieve \ntheir investment objectives. We have a longstanding belief that material \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) factors may be an important \ndriver of long-term investment returns. From our first application of \n\u201cavoidance screens\u201d in the early 1940s and the launch of our U.S. \nSustainable Equity team in 1989 to launching our Net-Zero Alignment \nIndicator in 2022 Neuberger Berman has been at the forefront of \nproviding clients with choice.\nOur ESG philosophy clearly distinguishes between process-focused \ninvesting and outcome-focused investing. Our ESG-Integrated strategies \nare process-focused, which means that we consider financially \nmaterial ESG factors as one investment input alongside many other \ntraditional factors. This could enable our identification of key risks that \n\nindividual issuers may face in the near term or over the long haul. As an \nactive manager, we believe this is not inconsistent with our duties as \na fiduciary and may in fact be required to fulfill those duties in certain \nmarkets. We also recognize that many clients desire a more outcomes-\nbased approach, which is why we also offer outcome-oriented strategies \nwhich are appropriately labeled in the product name, for example by \nusing the term \u201csustainable\u201d or \u201cimpact\u201d. This allows clients to make an \ninformed, conscious decision to invest in those strategies.\nToday, we continue to innovate, driven by our commitment to our clients \nand their choices. We also continue to deepen the robustness of our \nproprietary, analyst-led insights and engagement efforts across process-\nfocused and outcome-focused investment strategies in order to best serve \nour clients. \nOur ESG Philosophy\nWE CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, DRIVEN BY OUR \nCOMMITMENT TO OUR CLIENTS AND THEIR CHOICES.\n\n\nNEUBERGER BERMAN ANNUAL REPORT \u2013 JUNE 2023\n44\nLeveraging Our Robust Engagement Platform \nThe Neuberger Berman High Yield team invests in short-duration U.S. high \nyield fixed income securities and engages with issuers based on the UN \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in seeking investment returns and \na positive social and environmental impact.\nWe believe consistent engagement with issuers can result in effective \ndialogue and ultimately provide a greater probability of successful \noutcomes. Such engagement also helps build long-term relationships \nbetween our research team and managements. We leverage our deep \nresearch capabilities on a global basis to access both public and private \nissuers. Approximately 30% of U.S. high yield issuers are privately owned1 \nand not commonly reached by investors. We believe that our access to \nthese issuers provides a unique platform within fixed income markets.\nThe team sets engagement objectives for each issuer with the intention \nof driving change, in a process that often starts with education and \nknowledge sharing. This past year, we guided issuers on which ESG issues \nwe believe are most material to their business and operations, worked \nwith them to measure and publicly disclose ESG data, and directed them \nto establish objectives with the aim of contributing to the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.\nDetermining Engagement Potential\nOur research and ESG Investing teams collaborate on engagement \nobjectives aimed at amplifying each issuer\u2019s contribution to the UN \nSDGs. We closely monitor our engagement activity for progress toward \nobjectives with a multistage tracking system.\nThe opportunity for engagement is critical in deciding whether to \npurchase an issuer. If an existing holding fails to meet our ESG goals \nwithin two or three years, the investment team will consider divestment. \nOUR ACCESS TO PRIVATE ISSUERS PROVIDES \nA UNIQUE PLATFORM WITHIN FIXED INCOME \nMARKETS\n \nThe High Yield Team\u2019s \nSDG Engagement\nSPOTLIGHT\n1 \u0007\nJ.P.

We hypothesize that the monotonic transforms of distance matrices associated with\nthe two variables offers an additional attention mechanism to the traditional distance correlation,\nsuch that data points with small distances are treated as identical (one collapsed node within a\ntopological graph) and data points with large distances are considered disconnected (no matter\nhow distant they are from each other). Rather than simply thresholding the distance matrix, which\nreplaces a geometrical summary with a topological summary, we explore transforms that can\nsuppress variations among small distances (which tend to be dominated by noise) and among large\ndistances (which may not reflect mutual information between the two variables), while preserving\ngeometrical information (which may boost sensitivity to simple relationships). We refer to these\ntransforms as geo-topological transforms, because they combine aspects of geometry and topology.\nDepending on the choice of the lower and upper bounds, these transforms can threshold (lower\nbound l = upper bound u) at arbitrary levels, adapting to the granularity of the dependency present\nin a data set. They can also, optionally, preserve geometrical information (lower bound l < upper\nbound u).\n70\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Statistical power of AGTDM in multivariate association patterns.

For each pattern, an asterisk indicates that the test retains 50%-power\nat a noise level within 25% of the most sensitive test.\n4.3\nEmpirical Evaluation of AGTDM in Real-World Data\nEvaluation metric and benchmarks. In spirit of no free lunch in Statistics, [136] stressed\nthe importance of statistical power to evaluate the capacity to detect bivariate association. In our\ncontext, the statistical power of a dependence measure is the fraction of data sets generated from a\ndependent joint distribution that yield a significant result (with the false-positives rate controlled\nat 5%). [136] and [143] compared several independence measures and showed that dCor [124,\n125] and KNN mutual information estimates (MI) [126] have substantially more power than MIC\n[132, 133], but adaptive approaches like ADIC were neither proposed nor tested. To understand the\nbehavior of these adaptive dependence measures, we investigated whether their statistical power\ncan compete with dCor, MIC, MI and representational dissimilarity matrix correlation (rdmCor) [9].\nAs a fair comparison, other than the nonparametric or rank-based methods, here we adopted our\nmaximum selection subroutines to one of the popular parametric dependence measure, K-nearest\n71\n\n\nTable 4.2: Empirical evaluation of AGTDM.

{"query": "<image><image>Context:\n\n\u25a0\nOur business could\nl\nbe adverse\nr\nly impac\nm\nted by changes in consumer purchasing behavior, consumer prefer\nf\nences,\ntechnological changes, and market\nk\ntrends\nConsumer prefe\nf rences for produc\nd\nts and the methods in which they purchase products are constantly changing based on,\namong other factors, cost, perfor\nf\nmance, convenience, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. Consumer\npurchasing behavior may shift\nf the product mix in the markets in which we participate or result in a shift\nf to other distribution\nchannels, for example e-commerce. Consumer prefer\nf ences and broader trends, such as decarboni\nr\nzation and electrification\neffo\nf\nrts in response to climate change, may result in reduced demand for gas or fossil fuel-powered products and increased\ndemand for higher effi\nf ciency produc\nd\nts and/or more electric powered products. In addition, technologies are ever changing.\nOur ability to respond to these trends, timely transition our product portfol\nf io, develop new and innovative products, and\nacquire and protect the necessary intellectua\nt\nl property rights is essential to our continued success, but cannot reasonabl\na y be\nassured. It is possible that we will not be able to develop new technologies, products or distribution channels, or do so on a\ntimely basis, to align with consumer purchasing behavior and consumer prefer\nf ences, which could materially and adversely\naffe\nf ct our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u25a0\nOur operations could\nl\nbe adverse\nr\nly impac\nm\nted by material and component price volatility,\ny\nas well as suppl\nu\nier\nconcentration\nThe market prices for certain materials and components we purchase, primarily steel, have been volatile. In recent years we\nhave also experienced inflation-related increases in our transportation and other costs. Significant increases in the cost of any\nof the key materials and components we purchase would increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to\nlower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers.\nHistorically, there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers, and that lag, could\nnegatively impact our profita\nf\nbi\na lity. In some cases, we are dependent on a limited number of suppl\nu\niers for some of the raw\nmaterials and components we require in the manufact\nf\nur\nt\ning of our products. A significant disrupt\nr\nion or termination of the\nsuppl\nu\ny from one of these suppl\nu\niers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effe\nf ct on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u25a0\nBecause we participat\ni\ne in market\nk s\nt that are highl\ni\ny\nl competitive, our revenues and earnings could\nl decline as we respond to\ncompetition\nWe sell all of our products in highly competitive and evolving markets. We compete in each of our targeted markets based on\nproduct design, reliability, quality of products and services, advanced technologies, product performance, maintenance costs\nand price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufact\nf\nur\nt\ning, research and development and\ndistribution resources than we have; others may invest little in technology or product development but compete on price and\nthe rapi\na d replication of featur\nt\nes, benefits, and technologies, and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing\nmanufact\nf\nur\nt\ning or geographic footpr\nt\nints. New technologies and new competitors have developed and continue to develop in\ncertain markets in which we participate, such as gas tankless and heat pump technologies in North America. While we design\nand manufact\nf\nur\nt\ne these and other products, we cannot assure that our products will continue to compete successful\nf ly with\nthose of our current competitors and new market participants and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our customer\nbase or improve or maintain our profit\nf\nmargins on sales to our customers. There is also increasing use of data analytics,\nmachine learning, and artificial intelligence software, which our competitors may be able to use more effe\nf ctively or\nimplement more successful\nf ly than we are able to do.\nFailure to adapt to the evolving competitive environment could\nmaterially and adversely affe\nf ct our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u25a0\nBecause approximately\nl\n22 percent of our sales in 2023 were attributable to China, adverse\nr\neconomic conditions or\nchanges in consumer behavior in China could\nl impac\nm\nt our business\nOur sales in China increased four percent in local currency in 2023 compared to 2022. Our 2022 sales in China were\nimpacted by lower consumer demand driven by COVID-19 related disrupt\nr\nions. We derive a subs\nu\ntantial portion of our sales in\nChina from premium-tier products. Changes in consumer prefer\nf ences and purchasing behaviors including prefer\nf ences for e-\ncommerce and manufac\nf\nturer emphasis on brand ecosystems and connectivity, weakening consumer confid\nf ence and\nsentiment, as well as economic uncertainty, sociopolitical and demographic risks, and increased competition from Chinese-\nbased companies may prompt Chinese consumers to postpone purchases, choose lower-priced products or different\nalternatives, or lengthen the cycle of replacement purchases. Further deterioration in the Chinese economy may adversely\naffe\nf ct our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n8\n\n\nBusiness, Operational, and Strategic Risks\n\u25a0\nWe sell our products and operate outsi\nt de the U.S., and to a lesser extent, rely on impor\nm\nts and exports, which may\na present\nadditional risk\ni\ns\nk to our business\nApproximately 33 percent of our sales in 2023 were attributable to products sold outside of the U.S., primarily in China and\nCanada, and to a lesser extent in Europe and India. We also have operations and business relationships outside the U.S. that\ncomprise a portion of our manufact\nf\nur\nt\ning, suppl\nu\ny, and distribution. Approximately 5,000 of our 12,000 employees as of\nDecember 31, 2023 were located in China. At December 31, 2023, approximately $292 million of cash and marketable\nsecurities were held by our foreign subs\nu\nidiaries, subs\nu\ntantially all of which were located in China. International operations\ngenerally are subj\nu ect to various risks, including: political, religious, and economic instability; local labor\na\nmarket conditions;\nnew or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions, or changes to trade agreements; the impact of foreign government\nregulations, actions or policies; the effe\nf cts of income taxes; governmental expropriation; the changes or imposition of\nstatut\nt ory\nr\nrestrictions which prohibit repatriation of cash; the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on\nremittances and other payments by foreign subs\nu\nidiaries; labor\na\nrelations problems; the imposition of environmental or\nemployment laws, or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments; and differences in business practices. Unfavorable\nchanges in the political, regulatory,\nr\nor trade climate, diplomatic relations, or government policies, particularly in relation to\ncountries where we have a presence, including Canada, China, India and Mexico, could have a material adverse effe\nf ct on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the U.S.\n\u25a0\nA material loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay\na in purchases by one or more of our largest customers\nr could\nl harm our\nbusiness\nSales to our five largest customers represented approximately 42 percent of our sales in 2023. We expect that our customer\nconcentration will continue for the foreseeable future. Our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers\nmakes our relationships with each of these customers important to our business. We cannot assure that we will be able to\nretain our largest customers. Some of our customers may shift\nf their purchases to our competitors in the future. Our customers\nmay experience financial instability, affe\nf cting their ability to make or pay for future purchases. Further, a customer may be\nacquired by a customer of a competitor which could result in our loss of that customer. The loss of one or more of our largest\ncustomers, any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers, or our inability to successful\nf ly develop relationships\nwith additional customers could have a material adverse effe\nf ct on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u25a0\nA portion of our business could\nl\nbe adverse\nr\nly affe\nf cted by a decline in North\nt\nAmerican new residential or commercial\nconstruction or a decline in repl\ne acement-related volume of water heaters\nr and boilers, including a decline in demand for\ncommercial spaces\nResidential new construc\nr\ntion activity in North America and industry-\nr\nwide replacement-related volume of water heaters had\ngrowth in 2023 afte\nf r a decline in 2022. New residential housing starts in the U.S. are projected to be approximately flat in\n2024 compared to 2023. Commercial construc\nr\ntion activity in North America grew in 2023, although at a slower rate than\n2022. We believe that the significant majo\na rity of the markets we serve are for the replacement of existing products, and\nresidential water heater replacement volume have been strong. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses and\ncommercial spaces have experienced and may experience in the future, fluctuation in demand and in occupa\nu\nncy that may\nreduce demand for our products, and commercial sectors, such as the restaurant and hospitality industries in which we have\ncustomers, may experience long-term shifts\nf\nin consumer behavior which could negatively impact demand or capacity and\nmay not return to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the acceptance of remote work arrangements could negatively impact\ndemand for commercial construc\nr\ntion. Changes in the replacement volume and in the construc\nr\ntion market in North America\ncould negatively affe\nf ct us.\n\u25a0\nAn inability to adequately\nl\nmaintain our info\nn rmation syst\ny ems and their security,\ny as well as to protect data and othe\nt\nr\nconfid\nf en\nd\ntial info\nn rmation, could\nl adverse\nr\nly affe\nf ct our business and reput\ne\nation\nIn the ordinary course of business, we utilize information systems for day-to-day operations, to collect and store sensitive\ndata and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifia\nf bl\na e information of\nour customers, suppl\nu\niers and business partners, as well as personally identifia\nf bl\na e information about our employees. Our\ninformation systems are susceptible to outages due to system failures, cybersecurity threats, failures on the part of third-party\ninformation system providers, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, fraud, theft,\nf\nmalicious\nactors or breaches of security. Like many companies, we, and some third parties upon which we rely, have experienced\ncybersecurity incidents and attacks on information technology networks and systems, products and services in the past but, to\ndate, none have resulted in a material breach or had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of\noperations, or cash flows. We may experience such incidents and attacks in the future, potentially with increasing frequency\n9\n\n\nindefinite-lived intangible asset impairments. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or\nindefinite-lived intangible assets would negatively affe\nf ct our results of operations and total capitalization, the effe\nf ct of which\ncould be material. A significant reduction in our stockholders\u2019 equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived\nintangible assets may affe\nf ct our ability to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements.\nWe have identifi\nf ed the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy.

The holders of Common Stock\ncurrently are entitled, as a class, to elect only one-third of our Board of Directors. The holders of Class A Common Stock are\nentitled, as a class, to elect the remaining directors. Certain members of the founding family of our company and trus\nr\nts for\ntheir benefit (Smith Family) have entered into a voting trus\nr\nt agreement with respect to shares of our Class A Common Stock\nand shares of our Common Stock they own. As of December 31, 2023, through the voting trus\nr\nt, these members of the Smith\nFamily own approximately 66.2 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and\nCommon Stock, taken together as a single class, and approximately 96.9 percent of the voting power of the outstanding\nshares of our Class A Common Stock, as a separate class. Due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our\nCommon Stock (one-tenth of one vote per share) and shares of our Class A Common Stock (one vote per share), the Smith\nFamily voting trus\nr\nt is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote, including\nthe adoption of amendments to our certific\nf ate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of\ncontrol. This ownership position may increase if other members of the Smith Family enter into the voting trus\nr\nt agreement,\nand the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our Class A Common Stock held by\nstockholders who are not parties to the voting trus\nr\nt agreement are converted into shares of our Common Stock. The voting\ntrus\nr\nt agreement provides that, in the event one of the parties to the voting trus\nr\nt agreement wants to withdraw from the trus\nr\nt or\ntransfer\nf\nany of its shares of our Class A Common Stock, such shares of our Class A Common Stock are automatically\nexchanged for shares of our Common Stock held by the trus\nr\nt to the extent availabl\na e in the trus\nr\nt. In addition, the trus\nr\nt will\nhave the right to purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Common Stock proposed to be withdrawn or\ntransfer\nf red from the trus\nr\nt. As a result, the Smith Family members that are parties to the voting trus\nr\nt agreement have the\nability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the Smith Family decide to\ntransfer\nf\ntheir shares.\nITEM 1B \u2013 UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n12\n\n\nA.

Our sales projection is driven\nby continued end-market demand in water heating and a rebound in boiler and water treatment volumes afte\nf r 2023\ncorrections in end-market inventories. In our Rest of the World segment, we see overall growth with stability in China as the\neconomy continues to work through its challenges. We expect to achieve full-year earnings of between $3.90 and $4.15 per\nshare. Our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are governed by a number of federal, foreign, state, local and environmental laws concerning the generation\nand management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by\nthe Company or third parties. We have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures\nrelated to environmental matters were not material in 2023 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year. We\nhave reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with\navailabl\na e insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonabl\na y anticipated remediation costs. Although we believe that our\noperations are subs\nu\ntantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedur\nd\nes designed to maintain compliance, there\nare no assurances that subs\nu\ntantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However, since the same\nlaws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nRisk Management\nWe evaluate risk to our business in a number of ways, primarily through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process,\nwhich we conduct enterprise-wise on a periodic basis, and seeks to identify\nf\nand address significant and material risks. Our\nERM process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the Enterprise\ni\nRisk\ni\nManagement-Integr\ne\nated Framework\nr\n(2017) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO). We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. Our goal is to manage\nrisks prude\nr\nntly rather than avoid risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on our company only to a limited extent.\n26\n\n\nA team of senior executives prioritizes identifie\nf d risks, including decarboni\nr\nzation, new technologies and cyber threats among\nothers, and assigns an executive to address each majo\na r identifie\nf d risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. Our Board\nof Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and reviews significant identifie\nf d risks. The Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and\nmanage them. Our other Board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.\nOur goal is to proactively manage risks using a structur\nt\ned approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to\npreserve and enhance shareholder value. However, the risks set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affe\nf ct us and cause our results to vary materially from\nrecent results or from our anticipated future results.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to various types of market risks, primarily currency. We monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous\nbasis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures. We do not engage in speculation in our\nderivatives strategies. Further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in Note 1, \u201cOrganization and\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effe\nf ct of fluctuating foreign currencies. At December 31,\n2023, we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of $118.8 million. Assuming a hypothetical ten\npercent movement in the respective currencies, the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in\nexchange rates would amount to $11.9 million. However, gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offs\nf et by gains\nand losses in the underlying transactions being hedged.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis filing contains statements that the Company believes are \u201cfor\nf\nward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We perceive our recurring\ncustomer payments as high-quality assets given the broad and relatively inelastic demand for electricity and because our\ncustomers typically have high credit scores. As of December 31, 2023, our customers had, at the time of signing the customer\nagreement, an average FICO\u00ae score of 741. The purpose of our stringent credit approval policy is to ensure reliability of\ncollecting payment over the duration of the customer agreements. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 0.9% of our\ncustomers were in default (over 120 days past due) under their agreements.\nOur lease and PPA agreements typically include an opportunity for customers to renew for up to an additional 10 years via\ntwo five-year or one 10-year renewal options. The customer is obligated to make monthly payments to us, and we operate and\nmaintain the solar energy system and energy storage system, if applicable, in good condition throughout the duration of the\nagreement. Under our lease agreements and PPAs, the customer's monthly payment or price per kilowatt hour (\"kWh\") is set\nbased on a calculation that takes into account the life of the equipment and/or expected solar energy generation. The customer\nhas an option of choosing a flat rate without an escalator or a lower initial rate with an escalator. As of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 40% of our lease agreements and PPAs contained a price escalator, ranging from 0.9% to 3.9% annually.\nCustomer Agreements\n11\n\n\nHolders\nAs of February 19, 2024, there were approximately 31 holders of record of our common stock. Certain shares are held in\n\"street\" name and, accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing\nnumber.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds\nand any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not expect to pay any dividends on our capital stock in\nthe foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board, subject to\napplicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital\nrequirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors our Board may deem relevant. In addition,\nthe terms of our credit agreements and indentures contain restrictions on the payment of dividends and we may also enter into\nother credit agreements, indentures or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay\ncash dividends on our capital stock.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following stock performance graph compares our total stock return with the total return for (a) the NYSE Composite\nIndex and the (b) the Invesco Solar ETF, which represents a peer group of solar companies, for the period from July 25, 2019\n(the date our common stock commenced trading on the NYSE) through December 31, 2023.

We calculate the weighted average number of systems based on the number of\nmonths a customer and any additional service obligation related to a solar energy system is in-service during a given\nmeasurement period. The weighted average number of systems reflects the number of systems at the beginning of a period, plus\nthe total number of new systems added in the period adjusted by a factor that accounts for the partial period nature of those new\nsystems. For purposes of this calculation, we assume all new systems added during a month were added in the middle of that\nmonth. The number of systems for any end of period will exceed the number of customers, as defined above, for that same end\nof period as we are also including any additional services and/or contracts a customer or third party executed for the additional\nwork for the same residence or business. We track the weighted average system count in order to accurately reflect the\ncontribution of the appropriate number of systems to key financial metrics over the measurement period.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023\n2022\n2021\nWeighted average number of systems (excluding loan agreements and cash sales)\n219,100\n168,400\n125,100\nWeighted average number of systems with loan agreements\n120,400\n56,500\n27,200\nWeighted average number of systems with cash sales\n9,300\n4,000\n600\nWeighted average number of systems\n348,800\n228,900\n152,900\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding the impacts of interest expense, income\ntax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash compensation expense, asset retirement obligation\n(\"ARO\") accretion expense, financing deal costs, natural disaster losses and related charges, net, acquisition costs, losses on\nunenforceable contracts, losses on extinguishment of long-term debt, realized and unrealized gains and losses on fair value\ninstruments and equity securities, amortization of payments to dealers for exclusivity and other bonus arrangements, legal\nthe non-cash value attributable to the solar energy systems and energy storage systems, which includes accelerated depreciation\nand Section 48(a) ITCs or Section 48E ITCs, as applicable; however, we typically receive a majority of the cash distributions,\nwhich are typically paid quarterly. After the tax equity investor receives its contractual rate of return or after a specified date,\nwe receive substantially all of the cash and tax allocations.\nWe have determined we are the primary beneficiary in these tax equity funds for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we\nconsolidate the assets and liabilities and operating results of these partnerships in our consolidated financial statements. We\nrecognize the tax equity investors' share of the net assets of the tax equity funds as redeemable noncontrolling interests and\nnoncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets. The income or loss allocations reflected in our consolidated\nstatements of operations may create significant volatility in our reported results of operations, including potentially changing\nnet loss attributable to stockholders to net income attributable to stockholders, or vice versa, from quarter to quarter.\nWe typically have an option to acquire, and our tax equity investors may have an option to withdraw and require us to\npurchase, all the equity interests our tax equity investor holds in the tax equity funds starting approximately five years after the\nlast solar energy system in the applicable tax equity fund is operational. If we or our tax equity investors exercise this option,\nwe are typically required to pay at least the fair market value of the tax equity investor's equity interest and, in certain cases, a\ncontractual minimum amount. From our inception through December 31, 2023, we have received commitments of\napproximately $2.7 billion through the use of tax equity funds, of which an aggregate of $2.1 billion has been funded and\n$439.4 million remains available for use.\nKey Financial and Operational Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operational and financial metrics, to evaluate our\nbusiness, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate our financial projections and make\nstrategic decisions.\nNumber of Customers. We define number of customers to include every unique premises on which a Sunnova product or\nSunnova-financed product is installed or on which Sunnova is obligated to perform services for a counterparty. We track the\ntotal number of customers as an indicator of our historical growth and our rate of growth from period to period.\n68\n\n\nwith Atlas), (g) add European Union bail-in provisions and (h) add certain syndication-related provisions. In August 2023, we\namended the TEPH revolving credit facility to, among other things, (a) increase the aggregate commitment amount from $700.0\nmillion to $769.3 million, (b) increase the uncommitted maximum facility amount from $789.7 million to $859.0 million and\n(c) extend the maturity date from November 2024 to November 2025. In November 2023, we amended and restated the TEPH\nrevolving credit facility to, among other things, (a) increase the aggregate commitment amount from $769.3 million to $1.309\nbillion and (b) increase the uncommitted maximum facility amount from $859.0 million to $1.575 billion. In December 2023,\nan additional lender joined the TEPH revolving credit facility and the aggregate commitment amount was increased from\n$1.309 billion to $1.311 billion. In February 2024, we amended the TEPH revolving credit facility to, among other things,\nreflect an assignment of commitments occurring within the Atlas Lender Group (as defined by such revolving credit facility)\nwithout increasing the existing commitments and the appointment of a new Atlas funding agent for the Atlas Lender Group. As\nof December 31, 2023, we had $272.4 million of available borrowing capacity under the TEPH revolving credit facility.\nIn September 2020, one of our subsidiaries, Sunnova Asset Portfolio 8, LLC (\"AP8\"), entered into a secured revolving\ncredit facility with Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, as agent, and the lenders party thereto. The AP8 revolving credit facility was\npreviously amended in 2021 and 2022 and was amended in 2023 as described below. Under the amended AP8 revolving credit\nfacility, AP8 may borrow up to an initial aggregate committed amount of $215.0 million, subject to a borrowing base calculated\nbased on the sum of a specified advance rate applied to the net outstanding principal balance of the solar loans securing the AP8\nrevolving credit facility and the aggregate value of the solar energy systems owned by AP8's subsidiaries, which are primarily\ntax equity funds, subject to certain concentration limitations. The AP8 revolving credit facility has a maturity date occurring in\nSeptember 2024. The proceeds of the loans under the AP8 revolving credit facility are available for funding the purchase of\nsolar loans, making deposits in AP8's reserve account and paying fees in connection with the AP8 revolving credit facility. The\nAP8 revolving credit facility bears interest at an annual rate based on Term SOFR (as defined by such revolving credit facility)\nplus 3.00% per annum. Sunnova Energy Corporation guarantees the performance obligations of certain affiliates under\nagreements entered into in connection with the AP8 revolving credit facility, as well as certain indemnity and repurchase\nobligations. In March 2023, we amended the AP8 revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the aggregate\ncommitment amount from $75.0 million to $150.0 million. In June 2023, we amended the AP8 revolving credit facility to,\namong other things, increase the aggregate commitment amount from $150.0 million to $185.0 million. In August 2023, we\namended the AP8 revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the aggregate commitment amount from $185.0\nmillion to $215.0 million. We believe we will be able to satisfy this obligation due in September 2024 through refinancing of\nthe facility or alternatively through the use of our existing cash resources and liquidity. As of December 31, 2023, we had no\navailable borrowing capacity under the AP8 revolving credit facility.\nIn March 2023, one of our subsidiaries, Sunnova Inventory Supply, LLC (\"IS\"), entered into a secured revolving credit\nfacility with Texas Capital Bank, as agent, and the lenders party thereto, for an aggregate commitment amount of $50.0 million\nwith a maturity date of the earlier of (a) March 2026 and (b) six months from the latest maturity date of any material parent\ncredit facility (defined as a parent credit facility with a commitment of $250.0 million or more that, if terminated could\nindividually be expected to result in a liquidity event (as defined by such revolving credit facility)). The proceeds of the loans\nunder the IS revolving credit facility are available to purchase or otherwise acquire certain accounts receivable and inventory,\nfund certain reserve accounts that are required to be maintained by IS in accordance with the revolving credit agreement and\npay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the IS revolving credit facility. Interest on the borrowings under the IS\nrevolving credit facility is due monthly. Borrowings under the IS revolving credit facility bear interest at an annual rate based\non Term SOFR (as defined by such revolving credit facility). As of December 31, 2023, we had $18.7 million of available\nborrowing capacity under the IS revolving credit facility.\nIn September 2023, one of our subsidiaries, Sunnova Asset Portfolio 9, LLC (\"AP9\"), entered into a secured revolving\ncredit facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, for an aggregate commitment amount\nof $65.0 million, subject to a borrowing base calculated based on the sum of a specified advance rate applied to the net\naggregate balance of the home improvement loans securing the AP9 revolving credit facility. The AP9 revolving credit facility\nhas a maturity date occurring in October 2027. The proceeds of the loans under the AP9 revolving credit facility are available\nfor funding the purchase of home improvement loans and the related home improvement assets, making deposits in AP9's\nreserve account and paying fees and expenses in connection with the AP9 revolving credit facility. Interest on the borrowings\nunder the AP9 revolving credit facility is due monthly. Borrowings under the AP9 revolving credit facility bear interest at an\nannual rate based on Term SOFR (as defined by such revolving credit facility) plus a margin specific to each lender. In\nconnection with the AP9 revolving credit facility, one of our affiliates receives a fee for servicing the home improvement loans\nand related home improvement assets pursuant to a servicing agreement. In addition, Sunnova Energy Corporation guarantees\nthe performance obligations of certain affiliates under agreements entered into in connection with the AP9 revolving credit\nfacility, as well as certain indemnity and repurchase obligations. Obligations of AP9 under the AP9 revolving credit facility are\nsecured by first priority liens on substantially all of the assets of AP9. Certain obligations of AP9H under the sale and\ncontribution agreement are secured by a first priority lien on the equity of AP9 owned by AP9H. As of December 31, 2023, we\n84\n\n\n(8) Investments in Solar Receivables\nIn November 2021, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a Master Lease Agreement (the \"EAH Master\nLease\") with Energy Asset HoldCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of Lennar (\"EAH Lessor\"), to\nlease two pools of solar energy systems and assume the related PPA and lease obligations from EAH Lessor. In exchange for\nthe right to receive future customer cash flows as well as certain credits, rebates and incentives (including SRECs) under those\npooled agreements, we made an upfront payment to Lennar consisting of $35.0 million in initial cash consideration and\n1,027,409 shares of our common stock for net consideration of $79.4 million. Pursuant to the terms of the EAH Master Lease,\nadditional pools of solar energy systems may also be leased from EAH Lessor in the future in exchange for upfront lease\npayments. We will evaluate additional systems on a quarterly basis and, if eligible, are required to tranche the systems under the\nEAH Master Lease until March 2025.\nWe established criteria for eligibility that ensures each solar energy system is operational, in service, in good standing and\nno liens or encumbrances exist. We continue to provide all operations, maintenance and asset management services to EAH\nLessor related to the leased solar energy systems. EAH Lessor's residual interest in the solar energy systems comes from any\ncustomer renewal exercised after the twentieth anniversary of the contract term of the customer agreement, the remainder of the\nuseful life of the solar energy system after the termination of the customer agreement and any tax incentives (including Section\n48(a) ITCs) associated with the ownership of the solar energy system.\nAs the EAH Master Lease does not constitute or contain a lease under the criteria specified by ASC 842, the purchase of\nEAH Lessor's future revenue has been accounted for as an acquisition of financial assets and we have elected the fair value\noption under ASC 825. For the purposes of establishing the fair value of our investments in solar receivables, our analysis\nconsiders cash flows beginning in September 2021 (the effective date of the transaction). We estimated the fair value of our\ninvestments in solar receivables to be $84.3 million on the transaction date.\n(9) Long-Term Debt\nOur subsidiaries with long-term debt include Sunnova Energy Corporation, EZOP, HELII, RAYSI, HELIII, TEPH, SOLI,\nHELIV, AP8, SOLII, HELV, SOLIII, HELVI, HELVII, HELVIII, SOLIV, HELIX, HELX, IS, SOLV, HELXI, HELXII, AP9\nand HESI.

The Company's transit packaging products include \nautomation and equipment technologies, protective packaging solutions and steel and plastic consumables which are sold into \nthe metals, food and beverage, construction, agricultural, corrugated, and general industries. \nThe financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of \nAmerica (\"GAAP\") and reflect management\u2019s estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates, \nimpacting reported results of operations and financial position. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in \nconsolidation. In deciding which entities should be reported on a consolidated basis, the Company first determines whether the \nentity is a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d). If an entity is a VIE, the Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary \nand therefore, should consolidate the VIE. If an entity is not a VIE, the Company consolidates those entities in which it has \ncontrol, including certain subsidiaries that are not majority-owned. Certain of the Company\u2019s agreements with noncontrolling \ninterests contain provisions in which the Company would surrender certain decision-making rights upon a change in control of \nthe Company. Accordingly, consolidation of these operations may no longer be appropriate subsequent to a change in control of \nthe Company, as defined in the agreements.\nInvestments in companies over which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence \nover operating and financial policies, are accounted for by the equity method. The proportionate share of the net income \nresulting from these investments is reported in Equity in net earnings of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe carrying values of the Company's equity method investments are reported in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets. Equity method investments are reported at cost and adjusted each period for the Company's share of the \ninvestee's income or loss and dividends paid, if any. The Company classifies distributions received from equity method \ninvestees using the cumulative earnings approach. The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. \nForeign Currency Translation. For non-U.S. subsidiaries which operate in a local currency environment, assets and liabilities \nare translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income, expense and cash flow items are translated at average \nexchange rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments for these subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate \ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income in equity. For non-U.S. subsidiaries that use a U.S. dollar functional \ncurrency, local currency inventories and property, plant and equipment are translated into U.S. dollars at rates prevailing when \nacquired; all other assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Inventories charged to cost of sales and \ndepreciation are remeasured at historical rates; all other income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates \nprevailing during the year. Gains and losses which result from remeasurement are included in earnings.\nRevenue Recognition.  The majority of the Company\u2019s revenues from metal packaging products are derived from multi-year \nrequirement contracts with leading manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products for can sets, comprising a can \nand an end.   As requirement contracts do not typically include fixed volumes, customers often purchase products pursuant to \npurchase orders or other communications which are short-term in nature.  The can and the end are considered separate \nperformance obligations because they are distinct and separately identifiable.  Revenues from Transit Packaging are generally \nderived from individual purchase orders which may include multiple goods and services which are separate performance \nobligations because they are distinct and separately identifiable.\nThe Company manufactures certain products that have no alternative use to the Company once they are printed or manufactured \nto customer specifications.  If the Company has an enforceable right to payment for custom products at all times in the \nmanufacturing process, revenue is recognized over time.  In each of the Company\u2019s geographic markets, revenue from beverage \ncans is primarily recognized over time using the units produced output method as beverage cans are generally printed for a \nspecific customer in a continuous production process.  The timing of revenue recognition for the Company\u2019s other products, \nincluding beverage ends and three-piece products, which includes food cans and ends and aerosol cans and ends, may vary as \nthese products may be printed or customized depending upon customer preferences which can vary by geographic market.  \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n52\n\n\nRevenue that is recognized over time for the Company\u2019s three-piece products and equipment business is generally recognized \nusing the cost-to-cost input method as these products involve an intermediary step that results in customized work-in-process \ninventory.  For products that follow a point in time model, revenue is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfer.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or \nproviding services.  Standalone selling prices for each performance obligation are generally stated in the contract.  When the \nCompany offers variable consideration in the form of volume rebates to customers, it estimates the most likely amount of \nrevenue to which it is expected to be entitled and includes the estimate in the transaction price, limited to the amount which is \nprobable will not result in reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the variable consideration is resolved.  When the \nCompany offers customers options to purchase additional product at discounted prices, judgment is required to determine if the \ndiscounted prices represent material rights.  If so, the transaction price allocated to the discount is based on its relative \nstandalone price and is recognized upon purchase of the additional product.  Customer payment terms are typically less than \none year and as such, the Company has applied the practical expedient to exclude consideration of significant financing \ncomponents from the determination of transaction price.\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.  Shipping and handling \nfees and costs from product sales are reported as cost of products sold and are accrued when the Company recognizes revenue \nover time before the shipping and handling activities occur.  Costs to obtain a contract are generally immaterial but the \nCompany has elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred if the duration of the contract is one year or less.\nUnbilled receivables are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control has passed \nto the customer but the customer has not yet been invoiced because the Company does not have present right to payment.  The \nCompany generally has a present right to payment when title of product transfers.  Unbilled receivables are included in \nreceivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding decrease to inventory.\nContract assets are recorded for revenue recognized over time when the Company has determined that control for a \nperformance obligation has passed to the customer, but the right to invoice the customer is contingent upon the completion of \nthe performance obligations included in the contract.  Contract assets are classified as current as they are expected to be \ninvoiced within one year and may not exceed their net realizable value.  \nContract liabilities are established if the Company must defer the recognition of a portion of consideration received because it \nhas to satisfy a future obligation.  Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on when the Company \nexpects to recognize revenue.\nStock-Based Compensation. For awards with a service or market condition, compensation expense is recognized over the \nvesting period on a straight-line basis using the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are \nexpected to vest.  For awards with a performance condition, the Company assesses the probability of vesting at each reporting \nperiod and adjusts compensation cost based on its probability assessment.  The Company\u2019s plans provide for stock awards \nwhich may include accelerated vesting upon retirement, disability, or death of eligible employees. The Company considers a \nstock-based award to be vested when the service period is no longer contingent on the employee providing future service. \nAccordingly, the related compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals, or \nover the period from the grant date to the date that retirement eligibility is achieved if less than the stated vesting period.\n \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with maturities of three \nmonths or less from the time of purchase and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short maturity of \nthose instruments. Outstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit are included in accounts payable.  The Company generally \nclassifies any cash that is legally restricted as to withdrawal or usage as restricted cash.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and \ndo not bear interest. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on past events, including historical experience, current \nconditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of accounts receivable.  \nInventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined under \nthe first-in, first-out (\u201cFIFO\u201d) or average cost method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment (\u201cPP&E\u201d) is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and \nincludes expenditures for new facilities and equipment and those costs which substantially increase the useful lives or capacity \nof existing PP&E. Cost of constructed assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction and development \nperiod. Maintenance and repairs, including labor and material costs for planned major maintenance such as annual production \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n53\n\n\nline overhauls, are expensed as incurred. When PP&E is retired or otherwise disposed, the net carrying amount is eliminated \nwith any gain or loss on disposition recognized in earnings at that time.\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets described below (in years).  The \nCompany periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its PP&E and, where appropriate, changes are made prospectively. \n                       \n  \nLand improvements\n25\nBuildings and building improvements\n25 \u2013 40\nMachinery and equipment\n3\u2013 18\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of \naccounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned \nto the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is carried at cost and reviewed for impairment \nannually in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired.  Goodwill is \nallocated to the reporting units at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair values of the reporting units.  In \nassessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of \nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than \nits carrying amount.  Further quantitative assessment may then be required.   The quantitative assessment involves a number of \nassumptions and judgments, including the calculation of fair value for the Company\u2019s identified reporting units.   The Company \ndetermines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on an average of the estimated fair values using an income and \na market approach. The income approach utilizes significant assumptions, including revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (a non-\nGAAP item defined by the Company as net customer sales, less cost of products sold excluding depreciation and amortization, \nless selling and administrative expenses) margin growth rates, discount rates and terminal year exit multiples. If the carrying \nvalue of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying value of the \nreporting unit to its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.   \nFinite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.  Finite-lived intangibles are amortized on a \nstraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives described below (in years).  \nCustomer relationships\n10 - 18\nTrade names\n8 - 27\nTechnology\n6 - 8\nLong-term supply contracts\n15\nPatents\n8\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of \nlong-lived assets, primarily PP&E and finite-lived intangible assets, may be impaired, the Company performs a recoverability \nevaluation.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash \nflows, an impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value, based on discounted cash \nflows. Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are presented in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying value or fair \nvalue less cost to sell.\nLeases.  The Company has operating and finance leases for land and buildings related to certain manufacturing facilities, \nwarehouses and corporate offices, vehicle fleets and certain office and manufacturing equipment. Leases with an initial term of \n12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.  The Company's lease terms include options to extend the lease when it \nis reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option.  Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at \ncommencement of the lease, such as increases in index rates, are not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities and \ncorresponding right-of-use assets and are recognized in the period those payments are incurred.  The Company separates lease \nand non-lease components of lease arrangements and allocates contract consideration based on standalone selling prices.  \nVariable consideration is allocated to the lease and non-lease components to which the variable payments specifically relate.   \nThe discount rate implicit within the Company's leases is often not determinable and therefore the Company generally uses its \nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of the lease in determining the \npresent value of the lease payments.  The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on lease term and the currency in \nwhich lease payments are made.  The Company's leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material \nrestrictive covenants.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n54\n\n\nTaxes on Income. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Deferred taxes represent \nthe future expected tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based \nupon enacted tax rates and laws.  The Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future U.S. \ninclusions of certain intangible income of foreign subsidiaries as a current period expense when incurred.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be \nrealized.  Investment tax credits are accounted for using the deferral method. Income tax-related interest and penalties are \nreported as income tax expense.\nDerivatives and Hedging. All outstanding derivative financial instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair \nvalues. The impact on earnings from recognizing the fair values of these instruments depends on their intended use, their hedge \ndesignation and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging.  Changes in the \nfair values of instruments designated to reduce or eliminate adverse fluctuations in the fair values of recognized assets and \nliabilities are reported currently in earnings along with changes in the fair values of the hedged items. Changes in the effective \nportions of the fair values of instruments used to reduce or eliminate adverse fluctuations in cash flows of anticipated or \nforecasted transactions are reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts in \naccumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings when the related hedged items impact earnings or the \nforecasted transactions become probable of not occurring. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not \ndesignated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are reported currently in earnings. Amounts reported in \nearnings are classified consistent with the item being hedged.\nThe effectiveness of derivative instruments in reducing risks associated with the hedged exposures is assessed at inception and \non an ongoing basis. Time value, a component of an instrument\u2019s fair value, is excluded in assessing effectiveness for fair value \nhedges, except hedges of firm commitments, and included for cash flow hedges.\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when (i) the instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in fair value \nor cash flows of the underlying hedged item, (ii) the instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or (iii) designating the \ninstrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate.\nThe Company formally documents all relationships between its hedging instruments and hedged items at inception, including \nits risk management objective and strategy for establishing various hedge relationships. Cash flows from hedging instruments \nare classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the items being hedged.\nResearch and Development. Research, development and engineering costs of $33 in 2023, $34 in 2022, and $47 in 2021 were \nexpensed as incurred and reported in selling and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nSubstantially all engineering and development costs are related to developing new products or designing significant \nimprovements to existing products or processes. Costs primarily include employee salaries and benefits and facility costs.\nReclassifications.  Certain reclassifications of prior years\u2019 data have been made to conform to the current year presentation. \nRecent Accounting and Reporting Pronouncements.  \nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures of supplier finance programs.  \nThe guidance requires buyers in a supplier finance program to disclose sufficient information about the program\u2019s nature, \nactivity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. \nThe Company has various supplier finance programs under which the Company agrees to pay banks the stated amount of \nconfirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices.  Suppliers, at their sole \ndiscretion, have the opportunity to sell their receivables due from the Company earlier than contracted payment terms.  The \nCompany or the banks may terminate the agreements upon at least 30 days' notice. The Company does not have assets pledged \nas collateral for supplier finance programs. The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the programs \ntypically have payment terms of 150 days or less, consistent with the commercial terms and conditions as agreed upon with \nsuppliers.  The Company had $862 and $1,037 confirmed obligations outstanding under these supplier finance programs as of \nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 included in Accounts Payable.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n55\n\n\nThe Company is not obligated to acquire any shares of its common stock and the share repurchase program may be suspended \nor terminated at any time at the Company's discretion. Share repurchases are subject to the terms of the Company's debt \nagreements, market conditions and other factors.\nThe Board of Directors has the authority to issue, at any time or from time to time, up to 30 million shares of preferred stock \nand has authority to fix the designations, number and voting rights, preferences, privileges, limitations, restrictions, conversion \nrights and other special or relative rights, if any, of any class or series of any class of preferred stock that may be desired, \nprovided the shares of any such class or series of preferred stock shall not be entitled to more than one vote per share when \nvoting as a class with holders of the Company's common stock. \nDividends are payable when declared by the Company's Board of Directors and in accordance with the restrictions set forth in \nthe Company's debt agreements. While the Company's debt agreements impose restrictions on the Company's ability to pay \ndividends and repurchase common stock, the debt agreements generally permit dividends and common stock repurchases \nprovided that the Company is in compliance with applicable financial and other covenants and meets certain liquidity \nrequirements.\nU.

These factors, crucial for crafting ef-\nfective video summaries, align with the criteria valued by human annotators.\nThe primary focus of these advanced methods is on effectively incorporating\nvisual elements to meet these objectives. An interesting observation arises\nwhen scrutinizing the three score patterns of human-annotated video sum-\nmaries for the same video. It\u2019s apparent that these patterns differ, suggest-\ning that in the process of video summarization, humans not only consider\nvisual factors but also account for non-visual elements. Discarded frames\nare highlighted in red bars, while grey bars denote the selected frames used\nin constructing the video summary. The video comprises 199 frames, with\nnumbers indicating frame indices. The term \u201cWeight of visual factor\u201d is de-\nfined as the percentage or proportion of common visual objects present in a\nframe.\nsessment involves constructing both a prior joint distribution and its posterior\napproximation, based on the aforementioned four random variables. During\ntraining, the method is optimized by minimizing the distance between the\nprior distribution and the posterior approximation. However, accurately pre-\ndicting the behaviors of the data intervention and the model outcome can\nprove challenging in practice, given factors such as video noise or motion/lens\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the visualization technique used in this figure demonstrate the relationship between the original video frames, the model's predictions, and the generated video summary?

Using this observation, we show how to program modules\nwith encodings that allow them to selectively mate with other cubes to self assemble in\na unique target structure. Formulated as matrices, we demonstrate the number of unique\nencodings that can be programmed given criteria on attraction and agnosticism.\nFigure 6.2: Overview of our stochastic self assembly approach. (Left) Magnetic Pixels: Cu-\nbic modules are programmed with matrices of magnetic pixels. These permit module faces to\nmate selectively to assemble target geometries. 3x3 Matrices shown for clarity; our modules\nutilize 8x8. (Center left) Scalability: Our binary-valued, 8x8 matrices can encode 264 module\nfaces with unique permutations, and modules are inexpensive ($0.23). (Center right) Selec-\ntivity Guarantees: We leverage Hadamard matrices to encode magnetic pixels on faces with\n2 criteria. \"Locally\", mating faces attract in only one configuration; \"globally\", non-mating\nfaces attract in no configuration. (Right) Reconfigurability: Encodings are \"programmed\"\nas magnetic pixels using magnets installed on a 3-axis CNC. Modules can be re-programmed\nto self assemble into new target geometries.\nOur modules consist of PLA cubes, with squares of soft magnetic material (inexpensive\nCOTS fridge magnets) bonded to their sides (Fig. 6.2 center left). The encodings on these\nfaces generate both near-field forces and selectivity. This selectivity lets us use homogeneous\ncubic modules with planar faces, making modules both non-jamming and inexpensive to\nmass fabricate across scales. Key to our approach is the generation of selective encodings,\nfor which we leverage Hadamard matrices (Fig. 6.2 center right), and similar procedures\nmay have been used to create industrial-grade magnets with tailored selectivity properties\nin industry [147]. The two polarities of the magnetic pixels we encode onto faces correspond\nto elements of these binary-valued matrices. Our matrices enforce two key criteria. A local\ncriterion dictates behavior between faces intended to mate. If every pixel on one face, face\nA, is magnetically opposite to pixels on another, then we call that face its mate, A\u2019. These\nfaces thus form a maximally attractive mating pair. Our matrix pairs are designed to exhibit\nmaximal attraction in this one configuration, while placing guarantees on agnosticism in all\nother translations and rotations. A global criterion dictates behavior between two faces not\nintended to mate. For this, we ensure that any given matrix pair, A and A\u2019, cannot mate\nwith any other faces B, B\u2019, C, C\u2019 etc., in any configuration, and we place guarantees on\nthis agnosticism. We further demonstrate how to program module faces using a magnetic\n85\n\n\nplotter consisting of an electromagnet affixed to a 3-axis CNC. Crucially, these soft magnetic\nfaces are re-programmable, and thus modules can be repeatedly re-programmed with new\nencodings in order to self-assemble into new target geometries in 3 dimensions. Finally, we\ndesign and fabricate a set of 8 modules and demonstrate their stochastic self-assembly in a\nwater tank.\nThe chapter is structured as follows. We begin by introducing a procedure to generate\nselective magnetic encodings, and derive bounds on the number of modules that can be\nutilized given a threshold on agnosticism between programmed encodings.\nWe describe\nthe physical modules themselves, and the magnetic plotting technique used to program\nthem. We demonstrate our ability to make predictions with regard to the attraction and\nagnosticism between various magnetic encodings, and verify these experimentally. Finally,\nwe demonstrate stochastic self-assembly of our system using 8 modules in a water tank.\n6.1\nEncoding generation\nThis section describes how we generate encodings that satisfy the global and local criteria\ngiven above. Our encodings are based on Hadamard matrices, whose unique properties have\nlent their use to applications including Code Division Multiple Access and error correcting\ncode. The Hadamard matrix is a square matrix whose rows are all mutually orthogonal\nand whose elements are either 1 or \u22121 (here representing magnetic pixel polarization). As\na consequence of its row orthogonality, it follows that its columns are mutually orthogonal\ntoo. As a result, the dot product of any pair of rows, or any pair of columns, is equal to 0.\nIn addition, if a single row or column is multiplied by -1 before taking the dot product, the\nproduct remains 0.\nDefining the mate of matrix A as A\u2019=-A, the Hadamard product (6.1) between a matrix\nA of order N and its mate, normalized by the number of elements N2, is -1. This implies\nmaximum magnetic attraction. Conversely, the normalized Hadamard product between A\nand itself is +1, connoting maximal repulsion.\nLet SG be a global score indicating the\nmaximum attraction between non-mating pairs A and B in any configuration, and let SL be\nthe local score indicating maximum attraction between mating pairs A and A\u2019 in all wrong\nconfigurations. To permit self assembly, satisfying the global and local agnosticism criteria\nrequires the force enacted by our fluid Ff to satisfy \u22121 < Ff < min(SL, SG) in order to\nboth break apart unintended misassemblies and allow correct assemblies to survive. Because\ncontrolling the fluidic force is challenging, the goal is then to maximize min(SL, SG), making\nthem maximally agnostic, in order to place Ff between these values.\nNow, the row and column orthogonality described above yields that taking the Hadamard\nproduct between A and A\u2019 becomes 0 if one matrix is translated in only X or only Y, yielding\nmaximal agnosticism. However, agnosticism is not guaranteed for matrices translated in\nboth X and Y, or if they are rotated. To find matrices that maximize agnosticism in these\nconfigurations, we perform two searches. The first search shows that Hadamard matrices\nperform optimally among the set of all square matrices. The second search identifies the\nnumber of matrices that can be generated for a given bound on agnosticism performance.\n(A \u2299B)ij = (A)ij(B)ij\n(6.1)\n86\n\n\nFigure 6.14: Pixel-wise attraction and repulsion of a normalized order-8 Hadamard matrix\nduring rotation with its mate. For rotations of 90n\u25e6, attraction and repulsion cancel exactly;\nelsewhere, approximately.\nand we use the rotation matrix (6.4) to compute its new location (x\u2019,y\u2019) after an arbitrary\nrotation of \u03b8. We smooth the result using a 3x3 averaging kernel to remove artefacts from\nthe discretization, then evaluate the Hadamard product to evaluate the net force, assigning\na value of 0 (non-overlap, or agnosticism) where pixels do not overlap.\nFig.\n6.13 plots\nthis force for 10 matrices from -180\u25e6to 180\u25e6in 10\u25e6increments. While our search procedure\noptimized only for rotations of multiples 90\u25e6, this procedure verifies performance for arbitrary\nrotations. The attractive force is bounded by -0.25 in all orientations besides the intended\nmating configuration (0\u25e6). Pure agnosticism is further enforced at 90\u25e6n, where the square\nmatrices line up.\nFig.\n6.14 visualizes the pixel-wise attraction and repulsion during the rotation of a\nnormalized Hadamard with its inverse. At 0\u25e6, 90\u25e6, 180\u25e6and 270\u25e6, locally attractive and\nrepulsive pixels sum to 0, producing agnosticism. Elsewhere, attractive and repulsive pixel\ninteractions cancel to within an attractive bound of -0.2.\n6.3.8\nGlobal agnosticism criterion\nIn this section, we evaluate the global agnosticism criterion between two emblematic matri-\nces from our clique. Using the same tools used in the local case above, Fig. 6.15 shows the\ncorrelation between two matrices, illustrating their agnosticism over all translations. Equiv-\nalently, Fig. 6.16 illustrates their agnosticism in rotation, with a negative bound of -0.36\nthat indicates that attraction between non-mating faces is never greater than 36% of the\nattractive force between mating faces in alignment, as derived in our search.\n6.3.9\nStochastic self-assembly\nWe built and programmed 8 cubes to stochastically self-assemble into a \"meta cube\" (Fig.\n6.17), to suggest how cubes could be programmed to assemble structures into recursively\n100\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Given the context of magnetically programmed modules for stochastic self-assembly, how might the concepts of \"local\" and \"global\" agnosticism (as described for Hadamard matrices) be applied to a different encoding scheme, and what trade-offs might be involved in choosing one scheme over another?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/ca43ef4d69afcdbfcf1bbf1e0625f638.png", "data/qwen_images/1943121fd30514511e255b42d9e3ec2d.png", "data/qwen_images/397729a75e6d3e8da27554bef7c53d4e.png", "data/qwen_images/cd4dc351da0080c5f30af80f26cd3a54.png"]}
{"query": "<image><image><image>Context:\n\n5. How can clear objectives such as optimizing network performance, maximizing cover-\nage, or minimizing costs be defined and achieved within the constraints of a ROBUST\nnetwork?\nBy addressing these questions, this research intends to contribute to a richer under-\nstanding and more sophisticated handling of complex networks. The ultimate goal is to\narticulate and apply novel strategies that not only meet the theoretical challenges posed by\nspatiotemporal and bipartite dynamics but also address practical considerations in deploying\nthese networks across various domains.\n1.6\nResearch Hypotheses\nThese hypotheses are central to the research objectives, guiding the investigative approach\nand laying the groundwork for the subsequent methodology, analysis, and discussion. They\nare designed to be tested through a series of controlled experiments and comparative analyses,\naiming to demonstrate the validity and utility of ROBUST networks in real-world scenarios.\nH1: Utilizing ROBUST networks for dataset analysis will result in more precise and ac-\ntionable insights than those achievable with conventional models, such as heuristic al-\ngorithms, Integer Linear Programming (ILP), Greedy Algorithms, Combinatorial Op-\ntimization.

This hypothesis will be tested by determining the optimal balance between\n6\n\n\nFigure D.1: Invader-Defender relationship\nD.1.1\nOperational Framework\nThe Defender-Invader dynamic is underscored by defenders\u2019 proactive strategies to safeguard spe-\ncific regions or assets from invaders aiming to compromise, breach, or exploit them. Defenders,\nacting as specialized observers, employ detection, interception, and neutralization tactics against\ninvaders.\nDefinition of a Defender\nA defender is tasked with the protection of a spatial area, utilizing a\ndual-layer strategy that encompasses both the anticipation of invader actions and their subsequent\ninterception.\nTheir effectiveness is measured by their ability to predict potential breaches and\nimplement effective countermeasures to prevent invader success.\nDefinition of an Invader\nAn invader seeks to penetrate defined protective barriers with\nthe goal of disruption or unauthorized access. The unpredictable and complex nature of invader\nstrategies demands a defense approach that is both dynamic and adaptable.\n412\n\n\nD.1.2\nNode Interactions: Prediction and Interception Cycle\nAt the heart of the Defender-Invader relationship is a continuous cycle of prediction and inter-\nception. Defenders leverage predictive analytics to forecast invader movements and strategize the\nallocation of defensive resources for effective interception.\nD.1.3\nStrategic Defense Optimization\nOptimization strategies for defense involve developing and executing algorithms that enhance de-\nfenders\u2019 capability to efficiently allocate resources, ensuring broad coverage and high rates of in-\nterception. This process includes real-time online convex programming and scalable hierarchical\niterative methods.\nD.1.4\nSpatiotemporal Considerations\nEffective defense against invaders hinges on strategic considerations of both space and time:\nSpatial Optimization: Identifies the optimal deployment of defenders to cover potential inva-\nsion paths and safeguard critical assets. Temporal Adaptability: Involves the real-time adjustment\nof defense strategies in response to evolving invader tactics and behaviors.\nD.1.5\nEfficiency Metrics\nThe efficiency of defense strategies in the Defender-Invader dynamic is crucial for maintaining the\nsecurity and functionality of the protected spatial area. This efficiency is quantified through several\nkey metrics:\nInterception Rate:\nThis metric measures the percentage of successfully intercepted invaders\nout of the total number of attempted breaches. A higher interception rate indicates a more effective\ndefense strategy.\nInterception Rate =\nNumber of Interceptions\nTotal Number of Invasion Attempts\n413\n\n\nTime to Neutralize Threats:\nThis metric assesses the average time taken by defenders to\ndetect, engage, and neutralize invaders from the moment of detection. Shorter times suggest a\nmore responsive and efficient defense system.\nTime to Neutralize Threats =\nP Time Taken to Neutralize Each Invader\nNumber of Neutralized Invaders\nIntegrity of the Protected Area Post-Interception:\nEvaluates the condition of the\nprotected spatial area after defense actions have been taken. This includes assessing any damages\nor breaches that occurred despite interception efforts. High integrity levels post-interception signify\nminimal damage and effective containment of threats.\nIntegrity = Uncompromised Area\nTotal Protected Area\nResource Efficiency:\nAnalyzes how effectively the defenders utilize their available resources,\nincluding personnel, technology, and energy, to maximize interception rates and minimize response\ntimes.\nResource Efficiency = Number of Successful Interceptions\nResources Expended\nAdaptability Score:\nReflects the defense system\u2019s ability to adapt to new or evolving threats\nover time. This includes incorporating lessons learned from past invasions to improve future defense\nresponses.\nAdaptability Score = Number of Adaptations to New Threats\nTotal Encountered Threats\nThese metrics together provide a comprehensive overview of a defense strategy\u2019s effec-\ntiveness, allowing for targeted improvements and adjustments to enhance overall security against\ninvader threats.\n414\n\n\nD.4.5\nEfficiency Metrics\nThe effectiveness of strategies against Host-Parasite dynamics is quantified through several key\nmetrics:\nInfection Rate:\nInfection Rate = Number of New Infections\nTime Interval\nRecovery Time:\nRecovery Time =\nP Time Taken for Hosts to Recover\nNumber of Recovered Hosts\nNetwork Integrity Post-Recovery:\nNetwork Integrity = Number of Fully Functional Hosts Post-Recovery\nTotal Number of Hosts\nD.4.6\nConclusion\nThe Host-Parasite dynamics within ROBUST Networks highlight a critical aspect of network man-\nagement, focusing on the balance between resource exploitation by parasites and the resilience\nmechanisms of hosts. Through strategic spatial and temporal planning, alongside effective infection\ncontrol strategies, networks can enhance their resilience against parasitic threats, ensuring sustained\nintegrity and functionality. This dynamic underscores the importance of continuous monitoring,\nrapid response, and adaptive strategies in maintaining network health and performance amidst\nongoing parasitic challenges.\n421\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How can the effectiveness of a dynamic defense strategy be quantitatively assessed, considering both its immediate impact and its long-term adaptability to evolving threats?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/9ab8e0ec8d6fe4123754a27b734d3597.png", "data/qwen_images/f28754e4ffcdb4609f597c37ca9b644d.png", "data/qwen_images/176ac70c5cb9ba4f4bff4343deb70bcf.png"]}

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have established processes and policies for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks arising from cybersecurity threats and have integrated these\nprocesses into our overall risk management systems and processes. We routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential\nunauthorized occurrence on, or conducted through, our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of\nour information systems or any information residing therein.\nWe conduct annual risk assessments to identify cybersecurity threats, as well as assessments in the event of a material change in our business practices that may\naffect information systems that are vulnerable to such cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and\nexternal risks, the likelihood and potential damage that could result from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, and\nsafeguards in place to manage such risks. We also utilize threat modeling to evaluate changes to our applications or environments for new threats or risks, and\nour cybersecurity team monitors the threat landscape regularly using security industry sources and certain threat intelligence information. Blend conducts daily\nvulnerability assessments, prioritizes remediation, and engages in routine system and application patching as well as other proactive measures, where deemed\nappropriate, to mitigate reasonably foreseeable risks.\nBlend maintains an incident response plan that is designed to contain and resolve any suspected security incident identified by the Company. This plan is tested\nat least annually. Our security operations team triages issues and invokes the incident response plan when necessary. This plan includes provisions for\nnotifications of internal and external parties, including Blend leadership and the Audit Committee as required.\nFollowing these risk assessments, or when we otherwise identify cybersecurity risks through the processes described in this \u201cRisk Management and Strategy\u201d\nsection, we evaluate whether and how to re-design, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize identified risks and reasonably address any\nidentified gaps in existing safeguards. We devote significant resources and designate high-level personnel, including our Information Security Officer, who\nreports to our Head of Finance and Administration, to manage the risk assessment and mitigation process.\nAs part of our overall risk management system, we monitor and test our safeguards and train our employees on these safeguards, in collaboration with our\nhuman resources and information technology functional groups. Personnel at all levels and departments are made aware of our cybersecurity policies through\ntraining. Specific training is required for users of higher-risk systems or individuals associated with specific security processes such as incident response.\nOur cybersecurity program includes processes for identifying and managing risks from third parties and is integrated into our overall risk management\nframework. Our program defines key risk objectives and if cybersecurity risk exceeds defined thresholds, risks are documented and escalated into the\nenterprise risk program and Blend\u2019s internal audit team. We require all third-party service providers with access to our systems or processing sensitive data on\nour behalf to align with our cybersecurity objectives and adhere to industry best practices via contractual obligations that are entered into in connection with as\na mandated review prior to engaging such service providers. We re-evaluate each such service provider at least annually and when the role or purpose of a\nservice provider changes, and have processes to require service providers maintaining sensitive data on our behalf to delete such data at the time of termination\nof the contract.\nWe engage assessors or other third-party service providers in connection with our risk assessment and cybersecurity assessment or audit processes. These\nservice providers assist us to evaluate risks and identify where our current security program may be\n56\n\n\nimproved. We consult with these service providers as required to verify mitigation approaches, to compare Blend\u2019s security posture against industry peers, and\nto provide overall feedback for the security program. Additionally, we utilize outside service providers, as well as a bug bounty program, to penetration test our\nnetwork infrastructure and applications and provide prioritized security vulnerability findings reports that we include as part of our risk assessment processes.\nSome Blend customers also perform annual security testing on Blend\u2019s infrastructure and applications.\nLike other technology companies, we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past. We have not, however, been materially impacted by any previous\ncybersecurity incidents. For additional information regarding whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity\nincidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition, please refer to Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,including the risk factors entitled \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and\nOperations: A cyberattack, security breach, or incident affecting us or the third parties we rely on or partner with could expose us or our customers and\nconsumers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\u201d\nGovernance\nOne of the key functions of our board of directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks from cybersecurity threats. Our board\nof directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our executive officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the\nmaterial risks we face. Our board of directors administers its cybersecurity risk oversight function through the Audit Committee.\nOur Information Security Officer and our cybersecurity team (which consists of our security policy manager, security operations manager, and red team lead)\nare primarily responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Information Security Officer has over 20 years of\nexpertise within the cybersecurity field, and manages an experienced team with expertise in relevant security practices such as penetration testing, security\noperations, policy, etc.\nOur Information Security Officer and our cybersecurity team oversee our cybersecurity policies and processes, including those described in \u201cRisk Management\nand Strategy\u201d above. The processes by which our Information Security Officer and our cybersecurity team are informed about and monitor the prevention,\ndetection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents include monitoring of network, system and application logs, review of vulnerability scans and\npenetration test results, review of industry sources for vulnerability and threat indicators, and use of third-party service providers for audit or assessment\npurposes. In the event of a significant cybersecurity incident that is identified by the Company, Blend leadership and the Audit Committee is informed by the\nInformation Security Officer or our manager of security operations to support swift and informed decision-making.\nOur Information Security Officer provides quarterly briefings to the Audit Committee regarding our cybersecurity risks and activities, including our progress\non mitigating threats identified by external cybersecurity risk audits, any recent cybersecurity incidents and related responses, cybersecurity systems testing,\nactivities of third parties, and the like, in each case as applicable. Our Audit Committee provides regular updates to the board of directors on such reports.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Francisco, California, where we currently occupy facilities totaling approximately 47,000 square feet under a lease\nagreement that expires in 2025. We also lease offices in Thousand Oaks, California, Newport Beach, California, Lewisville, Texas, Omaha, Nebraska,\nCoraopolis, Pennsylvania, and Chennai and Bangalore, India. We have supplemented our leased space with temporary or on demand available space in New\nYork City, New York, New Orleans, Louisiana, Little Rock, Arkansas, Las Vegas, Nevada, Montgomery, Alabama, and Mexico City, Mexico. We do not own\nany real property. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and we believe we can acquire suitable additional or alternative\nspace as needed.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the normal course of business. We are not presently party to\nany litigation that, if determined adversely to us, we believe would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, or cash flows.\n57\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does Blend's approach to cybersecurity risk management and governance demonstrate a proactive and multi-faceted strategy for mitigating potential threats?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/dc4ea45e064910b86e79b506541d5070.png"]}

In 1950,\nGleason extended Tietze\u2019s theorem to preserve symmetries with respect to compact groups\nby averaging over the Haar measure. The group of translations, unfortunately, is not\ncompact, though it is locally compact. In 1951, Dugundji extended Tietze\u2019s theorem to\nany Z which is a locally convex vector space. Later Jaworowski (1981) and more recently\nFeragen (2006) proposed extensions of Tietze\u2019s theorem which generalise in both directions.\nWe leave it to future work to determine whether an equivariant extension theorem can be\napplied to extend the decoder from H\u2032 to all of HK+1.\nFinally, we compare the form of convolution deep sets (Theorem 4.8) to the form deep\nsets (Theorem 4.5). There are two important differences. First, for deep sets, the encoder\nis implemented with an MLP, and the decoder is also implemented with an MLP. For\nconvolutional deep sets, the encoder only depends on a choice for k, like the Gaussian\nkernel. It can therefore trivially be implemented and, in particular, it does not depend on any\nneural network. Additionally, the decoder is now a translation-equivariant map between\ntranslation spaces. Crucially, such maps are exactly what CNNs approximate (Theorem 3.1;\nYarotsky, 2022)! Therefore, for convolutional deep sets, the decoder can be implemented\nwith a CNN. The second difference pertains to the choice of maximum data set size N. For\ndeep sets, the dimensionality of the encoding depends on N. For convolutional deep sets,\non the other hand, the encoding always lives in HK+1, regardless of the maximum data\nset size. We could therefore imagine applying Theorem 4.8 to a sequence of Ns going to\ninfinity to obtain a version of convolution deep sets that holds for data sets of all sizes. We\nleave such a construction for future work.\nAfter introducing Theorem 4.8 (Gordon et al., 2020), Xu et al. (2020) also introduced func-\ntional representations in the context of meta-learning for the purpose of improving rep-\nresentational capacity. Whereas Theorem 4.8 uses a functional encoding, Xu et al. argue\nthat the encoder in Theorem 4.8 is limited. We, however, emphasise that the simplicity of\nthe encoder is without loss of generality, because Theorem 4.8 applies to any continuous\nfunction [D\u2032] \u2192Z which is translation equivariant. The simplicity of the encoder can\ntherefore be seen as a feature rather than a downside.\n4.5\nDiagonal Translation Equivariance\nConvolutional deep sets (Theorem 4.8) characterise translation-equivariant functions on\ndata sets. In this section, we investigate a slightly more general class: functions on data\nsets which are equivariant with respect to diagonal translations. Before stating the definition\nof diagonal translation equivariance (DTE), we first explain where DTE comes from.\n59\n\n\nIn Section 3.4, we defined mean maps (Definition 3.18), functions of the form m: [D] \u2192YX,\nand kernel maps (Definition 3.19), functions of the form k: [D] \u2192RX\u00d7X. In Section 5.5, we\nwill encounter mean maps m which are translation equivariant:\nm \u25e6T\u03c4 = T\u03c4 \u25e6m\nfor all \u03c4 \u2208X.\n(4.16)\nTheorem 4.8 can be used to characterise such mean maps m. We will also encounter kernel\nmaps k which are translation equivariant. Kernel maps, however, turn out to be translation\nequivariant in a slightly different sense:\nk \u25e6T\u03c4 = T(\u03c4,\u03c4) \u25e6k\nfor all \u03c4 \u2208X.\n(4.17)\nCompared to (4.16), (4.17) has T(\u03c4,\u03c4) on the right-hand side instead of T\u03c4, where T(\u03c4,\u03c4) is\na translation on X \u00d7 X. Recall that the codomain of k consists of functions on X \u00d7 X,\nnot on X. Because (4.17) has different symbols on both sides, we cannot directly apply\nTheorem 4.8. We will see that the symmetry in (4.17) is closely related to the notion of\ndiagonal translation equivariance (Definition 4.10), which we later define. The main result\nof this section is a characterisation of functions which are diagonally translation equivariant\nin the sense of (4.17).\nTheorem 4.9 (Convolutional deep set for DTE). Let Y \u2286R be compact. Suppose that\n[D\u2032] \u2286[D] is closed, is closed under translations, has multiplicity K, and has maximum data\nset size N < \u221e. Let k: X \u00d7 X \u2192R be a continuous strictly-positive-definite function such\nthat (1) k(0) = \u03c32 > 0, (2) k \u22650, and (3) k(\u03c4) \u21920 as \u2225\u03c4\u22252 \u2192\u221e. Denote the reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space associated to k by H. Let Z be a topological (X \u00d7 X)-translation space.\nLet C be another topological (X \u00d7 X)-translation space, let c \u2208C be diagonally translation\ninvariant and anti-diagonal discriminating, and denote C\u2032 = {T\u03c4c : \u03c4 \u2208X \u00d7 X}. Then a\nfunction \u03c0: [D\u2032] \u2192Z is continuous and diagonally translation equivariant in the sense of\n\u03c0 \u25e6T\u03c4 = T(\u03c4,\u03c4) \u25e6\u03c0\nfor all \u03c4 \u2208X\n(4.18)\nif and only if it is of the form\n\u03c0 = dec \u25e6enc\nwhere\nenc(D) =\n\"P\n(x,y)\u2208C \u03d5(y)k( \u2022 \u2212(x, x))\nc\n#\n(4.19)\nwith enc: [D\u2032] \u2192H\u2032 \u00d7 C\u2032 continuous and translation equivariant, dec: HK+1 \u2192Z con-\ntinuous and translation equivariant, and \u03d5(y) = (0, y1, . . . , yK). Here H\u2032 = enc([D\u2032]) is a\nsubspace of HK+1 which is closed and closed under translations.\n60\n\n\nCrucially, (4.31) has T(\u03c4,\u03c4) on both sides, so we may try to characterise \u03c0dup by applying\nTheorem 4.8 with X \u00d7 X as the space of inputs! Having characterised \u03c0dup, we also find\na characterisation of \u03c0 = \u03c0dup \u25e6dup, which is what we are ultimately after. To apply\nTheorem 4.8 with X \u00d7 X as the space of inputs, however, we require \u03c0dup to be (X \u00d7 X)-\ntranslation equivariant, that is, equivariant with respect to all translations on X \u00d7 X:\n\u03c0dup \u25e6T(\u03c41,\u03c42)\n?\n= T(\u03c41,\u03c42) \u25e6\u03c0dup\nfor all \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2208X.\n(4.32)\nUnfortunately, (4.31) says that \u03c0dup is only equivariant with respect to translations along the\ndiagonal of the space X \u00d7 X: translations of the form T(\u03c41,\u03c42) where \u03c41 = \u03c42. This motivates\nthe general definition of diagonal translation equivariance.\nDefinition 4.10 (Diagonal translation equivariance; DTE). Consider a map \u03c0: A \u2192B\nwhere A and B are (X \u00d7X)-translation spaces. Then \u03c0 is equivariant with respect to diagonal\ntranslations or diagonally translation equivariant (DTE) if\n\u03c0 \u25e6T(\u03c4,\u03c4) = T(\u03c4,\u03c4) \u25e6\u03c0\nfor all \u03c4 \u2208X.\n(4.33)\nIf a map \u03c0 is (X \u00d7 X)-translation equivariant, then it is also diagonally translation equivari-\nant. The class of DTE functions is therefore larger than the class of (X \u00d7 X)-TE functions.\nWhereas the previous section characterised functions on data sets which are TE, this section\ncharacterises functions on data sets which are DTE.\nDiagonal translation equivariance is intimately related to (X \u00d7X)-translation equivariance.\nIn technical terms, the group of diagonal translations is a subgroup of the group of (X \u00d7 X)-\ntranslations. We will use this relationship to derive a characterisation of DTE functions\nfrom Theorem 4.8. The key idea is as follows. Consider a DTE map \u03c0: A \u2192B between\n(X \u00d7 X)-translation spaces A and B. If \u03c0 were also (X \u00d7 X)-TE, then we could apply\nTheorem 4.8, and we would be done. However, \u03c0 is not (X \u00d7 X)-TE; it is just DTE. The\nidea is to make \u03c0 (X \u00d7 X)-TE by defining what happens for non-diagonal translations:\n\u03c0(T(\u03c41,\u03c42)a) := T(\u03c41,\u03c42)\u03c0(a)\nfor all \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2208X, \u03c41 \u0338= \u03c42.\n(4.34)\nThis almost works. The problem is that (4.34) might clash with the original definition of\n\u03c0: for some a \u2208A and \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2208X, T(\u03c41,\u03c42)a might equal another a\u2032 \u2208A, and it might be\nthat T(\u03c41,\u03c42)\u03c0(a) \u0338= \u03c0(a\u2032). Fortunately, this problem can be circumvented, as we will now\nexplain.\nLet C be another (X \u00d7 X)-translation space, this time topological. Let e\u22a5= (1, \u22121).\nConsider c \u2208C such that, for all sequences (\u03c4i)i\u22651 \u2286Xdbl, the sequence (\u27e8\u03c4i, e\u22a5\u27e9)i\u22651 is\n62\n\n\npractical consequence. If D = \u2205, then \u03c8(\u2205) will be a constant function, so k\u03b8(\u2205) will be a\nconstant function too. Since conditioning on no data (D = \u2205) recovers the prior, this means\nthat the ConvGNP is unable to model the prior! This substantial flaw of the ConvGNP\nunderlines the importance fully basing neural process architectures on representation\ntheorems, which guarantee that such representational capacity issues cannot occur. For\nthe ConvGNP, we momentarily deviated from this recipe by assuming a TE model for the\neigenmap, and we immediately ran into problems.\nThe GNP and ConvGNP parametrise the kernel map k by parametrising the eigenmap \u03c8. For\nthe third and last model that we construct in the section, we directly parametrise the kernel\nmap k without going through the eigenmap \u03c8. In Section 4.5, we investigated the notation\nof diagonal translation equivariance. In particular, we developed Theorem 4.9, an extension\nof convolutional deep sets (Theorem 4.8) to functions on data sets D which are translation\nequivariant in the sense of Definition 5.10. The Fully Convolutional Gaussian Neural Process\n(FullConvGNP) uses Theorem 4.8 to parametrise the mean map and Theorem 4.9 to para-\nmetrise the kernel map. As suggested just below Theorem 4.9, for Theorem 4.9, we choose\nc to be a Gaussian which decays with the distance from the diagonal.\nModel 5.13 (Fully Convolutional Gaussian Neural Process; FullConvGNP). The Fully\nConvolutional Gaussian Neural Process (FullConvGNP) parametrises\nz(m) : X \u2192R2,\nm\u03b8(D) = dec(m)\n\u03b8 (z(m)),\nz(m)( \u2022 ) =\nX\n(x,y)\u2208D\n\"\ny\n1\n#\ne\u22121\n2\u21132 ( \u2022 \u2212x)2,\nenc(m)\n\u2113(D)\n(data channel)\n(density channel)\nz(k) : X \u00d7 X \u2192R3,\nk\u03b8(D) = dec(k)\n\u03b8 (z(k)),\nz(k)( \u2022 ) =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\nX\n(x,y)\u2208D\n\"\ny\n1\n#\ne\u22121\n2\u21132 \u2225\u2022 \u2212(x,x)\u22252\n2\ne\u2212\n1\n2\u21132 \u27e8\u2022 ,(1,\u22121)\u27e92\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\nenc(k)\n\u2113(D)\n(data channel)\n(density channel)\n(source channel)\nwhere \u2113> 0 are length scales and\ndec(m)\n\u03b8 : C(X, R2) \u2192C(X, R),\n(5.16)\ndec(k)\n\u03b8 : C(X \u00d7 X, R3) \u2192Cp.s.d(X \u00d7 X, R)\n(5.17)\nare translation-equivariant maps implemented by convolutional neural networks.\n77\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the concept of diagonal translation equivariance (DTE) differ from general (X \u00d7 X)-translation equivariance, and what is the significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/9c3845a2f46686edd0d28156a9c3f1b0.png", "data/qwen_images/46ed13aad403bde30c32c64db4592d74.png", "data/qwen_images/42bc3b38f65820f95cd58e10fd5c982a.png"]}

Consequently, the net assets related to the Fell Block were impaired to their known selling price.\nAdditionally, Management assessed impairment indicators for each of the other CGUs, such as future Brent oil prices based\non internal estimates and other available sources, the amounts of reserves certified by D&M, changes in market and tax\nconditions, between others, and concluded that there were no impairment indicators at year-end.\nAs a consequence of the evaluation, the following amounts of impairment loss were (recognized) reversed:\nAmounts in US$\u2018000\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\nChile (a)\n(13,332)\n\u2014\n(17,641)\nArgentina (b)\n\u2014\n\u2014\n13,307\n(13,332)\n\u2014\n(4,334)\n(a)\nRecognition of impairment loss in the Fell Block due to the known selling price of the related net assets in the context of\nthe transaction described in Note 36.1 in 2023, and due to the decline in the proved reserves estimation in 2021.\n(b)\nReversal of impairment loss in the Aguada Baguales and El Porvenir Blocks due to the known market price of the blocks\nin the context of the transaction described in Note 36.3.\nNote 38\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supplemental information on oil and gas activities (unaudited)\nThe following information is presented in accordance with ASC No. 932 \u201cExtractive Activities- Oil and Gas\u201d, as amended by\nASU 2010 - 03 \u201cOil and Gas Reserves.

Management believes it is more likely than not \nthat a certain category of foreign tax credit carryover will not reduce future years\u2019 tax liabilities. As such, valuation allowances of $1.0 million have \nbeen recorded on the deferred tax assets related to the foreign tax credit carryovers as of both February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023. \nThe Company had state income tax credit carryforwards of $8.0 million (net of federal tax) as of both February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, \nrespectively.

Awareness of such costs will impose a discipline on our\nwork, such that we opt for carbon-neutral cloud providers. In cases where models\nare developed on local infrastructure, this will encourage the use of more efficient\nGPUs and the utilisation of techniques that result in faster builds.\n5.8\nDiscussion\nValidation accuracy and model perplexity (PPL) in developing the baseline and op-\ntimal Transformer models are illustrated in Figures 5.5 and 5.6. Training a Trans-\nformer model with a 16k BPE subword model boosted the validation accuracy by\nover 8% compared to its baseline.\nRapid convergence was observed while training the baseline model such that\nlittle accuracy improvement occurred after 20k steps. Including a subword model\nled to slower converging models, with only marginal gains recorded after 60k steps.\nExamining Figures 5.5 and 5.6, we can see that PPL achieves a lower global minimum\nwhen the Transformer approach is used with a 16k BPE subword model.\nThe\nPPL global minimum (2.7) is over 50% lower than the corresponding PPL for the\nTransformer base model (5.5). This finding illustrates that choosing an optimal\nsubword model delivers significant performance gains.\nTranslation engine performance, at the corpus level, was benchmarked against\nGoogle Translate\u2019s6 EN\u2194GA translation service, which is freely available on the\ninternet. Four random samples were selected from the English source test file and\nare presented in Table 5.9.

These metrics indicate the accuracy\nof the translations derived from our NMT systems.\nCase-insensitive BLEU scores at the corpus level are reported.\nModel train-\ning was stopped after 40k training steps or once an early stopping criterion of no\nimprovement in validation accuracy for four consecutive iterations was recorded.\nPPL is often used to evaluate language models within NLP. It measures the ef-\nfectiveness of a probability model in predicting a sample. As a metric for translation\nperformance, it is important to keep low scores so that the number of alternative\ntranslations is reduced.\n7.7.3\nResults: Automatic Evaluation\nThe experimental results from LoResMT 2021 are summarised in Tables 7.5 and\n7.6. In the LoResMT2021 Shared Task, the highest-performing EN\u2192GA system\nwas submitted by the ADAPT team (Lankford et al. 2021a). The system uses an\nextended Covid dataset, which is a combination of the 2021 MT Summit Covid\nbaseline and a custom ADAPT Covid dataset. The model, developed within adapt-\nNMT, uses a Transformer architecture with 2 heads. It performs well across all\nkey translation metrics (BLEU: 36.0, TER: 0.531 and ChrF3: 0.6). The training of\nthis EN\u2192GA model is illustrated in Figure 7.9.

Business.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is the world\u2019s largest home improvement retailer based on net sales for fiscal 2023. We offer our customers a wide\nassortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, d\u00e9cor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and\noperations products. We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. As\nof the end of fiscal 2023, we operated 2,335 stores located throughout the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories\nof the U.S.\u00a0Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. The Home Depot stores average approximately 104,000\u00a0square feet of enclosed\nspace, with approximately 24,000 additional square feet of outside garden area. We also maintain a network of distribution and fulfillment\ncenters, as well as a number of e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. When we refer to \u201cThe Home Depot,\u201d the \u201cCompany,\u201d\n\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d in this report, we are referring to The Home Depot, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Home Depot, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1978. Our Store Support Center (corporate headquarters) is located at\n2455 Paces Ferry Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Our telephone number at that address is (770)\u00a0433-8211.\nOUR BUSINESS\nOUR STRATEGY\nThe retail landscape has changed rapidly over the past several years, with a complex macroeconomic environment and customer expectations\ncontinually evolving. In fiscal 2023, we experienced a year of moderation after the unprecedented growth of the prior three years, as we\nnavigated the continued shift in consumer consumption trends away from goods and towards services and the impact of a rising interest rate\nenvironment. Our ability to operate successfully and meet the needs of our customers in an efficient and cost-effective way was due in significant\npart to our investments over the past several years aimed at creating an interconnected, frictionless shopping experience that enables our\ncustomers to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Going forward, we will continue to leverage the momentum of these investments\nand invest in our business in support of the following goals:\n\u2022\nWe intend to provide the best customer experience in home improvement and develop differentiated capabilities for our customers;\n\u2022\nWe intend to extend our position as the low-cost provider in home improvement; and\n\u2022\nWe intend to be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.\nWe believe that these goals will help us grow faster than the market and deliver value to our shareholders. We are steadfast in this commitment,\nwhile also recognizing that exercising corporate responsibility and being informed by the needs of our other stakeholders, including our\ncustomers, associates, supplier partners, and communities, creates value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nDELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE\nWe deliver on our objective to create shareholder value through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our capital allocation principles\nare as follows:\n\u2022\nFirst, we intend to reinvest in our business to drive growth faster than the market.\n\u2022\nSecond, after meeting the needs of the business, we look to pay a quarterly dividend.\n\u2022\nThird, after reinvesting in our business and paying our dividend, we intend to return excess cash to our shareholders through share\nrepurchases.\nIn fiscal 2023, we invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures to support our business, advance our goals, and continue to build an\ninterconnected customer experience. We also focused on driving productivity throughout the business by lowering our product and transportation\ncosts and initiating a plan to reduce our fixed cost structure by approximately $500 million, which we expect will be realized in fiscal 2024. The\ncombination of reinvesting in the business to drive higher sales and supporting productivity to lower costs allows us to improve our customer\nexperience, increase our competitiveness in the market, and deliver shareholder value.\nFiscal 2023 Form 10-K\n1\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe believe our merchandising organization is a key competitive advantage, delivering product innovation, assortment and value, which\nreinforces our position as the product authority in home improvement. In fiscal 2023, we continued to invest in merchandising resets in our stores\nto refine assortments, optimize space productivity, introduce innovative new products to our customers, and improve visual merchandising to\ndrive a better shopping experience. At the same time, we remain focused on offering everyday values in our stores and online. To help our\nmerchandising organization keep pace with changing customer expectations and increasing desire for innovation, localization, and\npersonalization, we are continuing to invest in tools to better leverage our data and drive a deeper level of collaboration with our supplier\npartners. As a result, we have continued to focus on enhanced merchandising information technology tools to help us: (1)\u00a0build an\ninterconnected shopping experience that is tailored to our customers\u2019 shopping intent and location; (2)\u00a0provide the best value in the market; and\n(3)\u00a0optimize our product assortments. Our merchandising team leverages technology and works closely with our inventory and supply chain\nteams, as well as our supplier partners, to manage our assortments, drive innovation, manage the cost environment, and adjust inventory levels\nto respond to fluctuations in demand.\nTo complement our merchandising efforts, we offer a number of services for our customers, including installation services for our DIY and DIFM\ncustomers, as noted above. We also provide tool and equipment rentals at locations across the U.S. and Canada, providing value and\nconvenience for both Pros and consumers. To improve the customer experience and continue to grow this differentiated service offering, we are\ncontinuing to invest in more locations (including continuing to pilot rental locations in Mexico), more tools, and better technology.\nSourcing and Quality Assurance\nWe maintain a global sourcing program to obtain high-quality and innovative products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and around the\nworld. During fiscal 2023, in addition to our U.S. sourcing operations, we maintained sourcing offices in Mexico, Canada, China, India, Vietnam\nand Europe. To ensure that suppliers adhere to our high standards of social and environmental responsibility, we also have a global responsible\nsourcing program. Under our supplier contracts, our suppliers are obligated to ensure that their products comply with applicable international,\nfederal, state and local laws. These contracts also require compliance with our responsible sourcing standards, which cover a variety of\nexpectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, compliance with applicable laws and regulations\naddressing prohibitions on child and forced labor, health and safety, environmental matters, compensation, and hours of work. To drive\naccountability with our suppliers, our standard supplier buying agreement includes a factory audit right related to these standards, and we\nconduct factory audits and compliance visits with non-Canada and non-U.S. suppliers of private branded and direct import products. Our 2023\nResponsible Sourcing Report, available on our website at https://corporate.homedepot.com under \u201cResponsibility > Sourcing Responsibly,\u201d\nprovides more information about this program. In addition, we have both quality assurance and engineering resources dedicated to establishing\ncriteria and overseeing compliance with safety, quality and performance standards for our private branded products.\nIntellectual Property\nOur business has one of the most recognized brands in North America. As a result, we believe that The Home Depot  trademark has significant\nvalue and is an important factor in the marketing of our products, e-commerce, stores and business. We have registered or applied for\nregistration of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and internet domain names, both domestically and internationally, for use in our business,\nincluding our proprietary brands such as HDX , Husky , Hampton Bay , Home Decorators Collection , Glacier Bay , Vigoro , Everbilt  and\nLifeproof . The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed\nindefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nWe also maintain patent portfolios relating to our business operations, retail services, and products, and we seek to patent or otherwise protect\ninnovations we incorporate into our business. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio\nhas been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. Although our patents have value, no\nsingle patent is essential to our business. We continuously assess our merchandising departments and product lines for opportunities to expand\nthe assortment of products offered within The Home Depot\u2019s portfolio of proprietary and exclusive brands.\nCOMPETITION AND SEASONALITY\nOur industry is highly competitive, fragmented, and evolving. As a result, we face competition for customers for our products and services from a\nvariety of retailers, suppliers, service providers, and distributors and manufacturers that sell products directly to their respective customer bases.\nThese competitors range from traditional brick-and-mortar, to multichannel, to exclusively online, and they include a number of other home\nimprovement retailers; local,\n \n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nFiscal 2023 Form 10-K\n3\n\n\nTable of Contents\nincluding expansion of our last mile delivery capacity. We have also opened additional flatbed distribution centers, which handle large items like\nlumber and building materials that are transported on flatbed trucks. Our network is designed to create a competitive advantage with unique,\nindustry-leading capabilities for home improvement needs for both our Pros and consumers. We will continue to invest in our supply chain\nnetwork as needed to support our business.\nIn addition to our distribution and fulfillment centers, we leverage our stores as a network of convenient customer pickup, return, and delivery\nfulfillment locations. Our premium real estate footprint provides a distinct structural and competitive advantage. For customers who shop online\nand want to pick up or return merchandise at a store, or have it delivered from a store, we have four interconnected retail programs: BOSS,\nBOPIS, BODFS, and BORIS. We also provide curbside pickup to complement our BOPIS offerings, in addition to the self-service lockers at the\nfront entrance of many of our stores. We also offer car and van delivery service from the majority of our U.S. stores. For fiscal 2023,\napproximately 50% of our U.S. online orders were fulfilled through a store. We also continue to focus on developing new capabilities to improve\nboth efficiency and customer experience for delivery from our stores. Our strategic intent is to have a portfolio of efficient, timely and reliable\nsources and methods of delivery to choose from, optimizing order fulfillment and delivery based on customer needs, inventory locations, and\navailable transportation options.\nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nWe view corporate responsibility matters through the lens of our business, with an understanding that if we support our associates, our\ncustomers, our supplier partners, and the communities we serve, we also support our business and create long-term value for our shareholders.\nAs a result, we believe that what is commonly called ESG today is fundamentally embedded in our operations and culture. We organize our\nefforts around three pillars: (1) Focus on Our People, (2) Operate Sustainably, and (3) Strengthen Our Communities. Highlights of each of these\npillars are set forth below. For further information on our three pillars and other ESG-related matters, see our annual ESG Report, available on\nour website at https://corporate.homedepot.com/responsibility.\nFocus on Our People\nOur culture and our associates provide intangible and hard-to-replicate competitive advantages, which have been key to helping us navigate\nchallenging market conditions. Our associates are essential to providing the experience and service that our customers demand. To preserve\nand protect that customer experience, we focus on cultivating a compelling associate experience, which we believe supports our ability to attract\nand retain our associates. This includes investing in competitive wages and benefits while also providing the culture, tools, training and\ndevelopment opportunities that make working at The Home Depot an enjoyable and rewarding experience. These actions are the foundation of\nour key tenets of putting customers first and taking care of our associates.\nCulture and Values. The Home Depot has a strong commitment to ethics and integrity, and we are a values- and culture-centric business. Our\ncommitment to our core values drives our approach to human capital management. Our culture is based on our servant leadership philosophy\nrepresented by the inverted pyramid, which puts primary importance on our customers and our associates by positioning them at the top, with\nsenior management at the base in a support role. We bring our culture to life through our core values, which serve as the foundation of our\nbusiness and as the guiding principles behind the decisions we make every day.\nOur values also guide our efforts to create an environment that will help us attract and retain skilled associates in the competitive marketplace for\ntalent. We empower our associates to deliver a superior customer experience by living our values, and we position our associates to embody our\ncore values by integrating the importance of our culture into ongoing development programs and rewards programs.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as\nof January\u00a028, 2024 and January\u00a029, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period\nended January\u00a028, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January\u00a028, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March\u00a013, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthese consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our\naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\u00a0relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical\naudit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating\nthe critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEstimation of store shrink\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company\u2019s U.S. merchandise inventories are stated at the\nlower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns,\nand inventory losses (or shrink). Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. The\nCompany calculates shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and\nestimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical\ninventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results.\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in the period between physical inventory counts and fiscal year-end as\na critical audit matter.

We opened eight new hospitals, expanding our capacity to produce high-\nquality outcomes for medically complex, high-acuity patients in need of inpatient rehabilitative care. These \nresults derive from our highly competent and dedicated workforce and reflect our investments and strategic \ninitiatives over many years. We believe these efforts have established important and sustainable competitive \nadvantages.  \nOur value proposition continues to resonate with referral sources, payors and patients. In 2023, we cared for \nmore than 229,000 patients, resulting in total discharge growth of 8.7%, inclusive of 4.8% same-store growth. \nOur focus on recruiting and retention yielded significant benefits. Compared to 2022, we increased net \nsame-store nursing hires by 20%. We reduced nursing turnover by 500 basis points and therapy turnover \nby 130 basis points. Our improvements in hiring and retention facilitated a substantial reduction in premium \nlabor expenses evidenced by a 32.9% reduction in the aggregate of contract labor expense and sign-on and \nshift bonuses.\nPrudent expense management and increasing economies of scale drove the 18.5% increase in Adjusted \nEBITDA. We continued to generate significant levels of Adjusted free cash flow. In 2023, our Adjusted free \ncash flow of approximately $526 million was sufficient to fund capital expenditures and our cash dividend on \ncommon stock. Our year-end net leverage declined to 2.7x from 3.4x at the end of 2022.  \nOur investment in new hospitals and bed additions exceeded $350 million in 2023. We opened eight new \nhospitals with a total of 395 beds and added 46 beds to existing hospitals, for a net increase of 4.1% in \nlicensed beds. In 2024, we expect to open six new hospitals and add approximately 150 beds to existing \nhospitals. \nWe remain focused on providing best-in-class inpatient rehabilitative care and continue to invest in facility-\nbased technology through initiatives such as on-site dialysis services. Our on-site dialysis program is now \navailable in 83 of our hospitals, and we will continue to roll out additional locations throughout 2024. We \ncontinue to further our clinical innovations such as the use of predictive models that combine with our core \nclinical practice protocols to consistently produce high-quality patient outcomes. As an example, our fall \nprediction model has resulted in a 24% reduction in fall rates per 1,000 patient days since its implementation \nin 2021.\nThere is a significant unmet need for inpatient rehabilitation services in the United States. This demand \ncontinues to grow with the aging demographics of our country. In 2010, 39 million Americans were aged \n65 or older. That increased to 55 million in 2020 and is expected to reach 73 million by 2030. Despite the \ngrowing demand for inpatient rehabilitation services, inpatient rehabilitation capacity across the industry \nhas been relatively static. Currently, only approximately 13% of the patients in acute care hospitals that are \nneeds of our country s agin\ninclude our significant inve\ninformation systems, and o\n \nThank you for your continue\n \n \nSincerely, \n \nINSERT SIGNATURE \n \nDonald L.

While we treat patients of all ages, most of our patients are 65 and older, and the number of Medicare enrollees is \nexpected to grow approximately 3% per year for the foreseeable future, reaching approximately 73 million people over the age \nof 65 by 2030. More specifically, the average age of our Medicare patients is approximately 76, and the population group \nranging in ages from 75 to 79 is expected to grow at approximately 5% per year through 2026. We believe the demand for the \nservices we provide will continue to increase as the U.S. population ages. We believe these factors align with our strengths in, \nand focus on, inpatient rehabilitation services.\nDespite the growing demand for inpatient rehabilitation services, the number of inpatient rehabilitation facilities has \nremained relatively stable \u2014 increasing just 0.17% from 1,179 in 2010 to 1,181 in 2022. This supply-demand imbalance is \npartly responsible for the relatively low conversion rate of inpatient rehabilitation eligible patients. We believe the percentage \nof patients who are discharged from acute-care hospitals with one or more of 13 specified medical conditions that CMS ties to \nIRF eligibility and subsequently admitted to an IRF is approximately 13% based on Medicare fee-for-service data, which is the \nonly publicly available data on the subject. To respond to the strong demand for our services, we continue to develop our \ncurrent markets through bed additions and to construct or acquire hospitals in new markets. Since 2012, we have opened or \nacquired 61 new hospitals and increased the number of licensed beds we operate by approximately 62%, or 4,122 beds.\nStrategy and 2024 Strategic Priorities\nOur overall strategy is to expand our network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, add capacity to existing hospitals, \nfurther strengthen our relationships with healthcare systems, provider networks, and payors in order to connect patient care \nacross the healthcare continuum, and to deliver superior patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner. We believe this strategy, \nalong with our demonstrated ability to adapt to changes in healthcare, positions us for success in the evolving healthcare \ndelivery system. In pursuit of our strategy, we established the following priorities for 2024.\n\u2022\nGrowth. We target the addition of 6 to 10 new inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and 80 to 120 beds to existing\nhospitals per year. In 2023, we opened 8 new hospitals (395 beds total) and added 46 beds to existing hospitals. In\n2024, we plan to open 6 hospitals (approximately 280 beds) and add approximately 150 beds to existing hospitals\n(inclusive of a 40-bed freestanding satellite hospital). We also believe we will continue to have organic growth\nopportunities based on our track record of growth, planned bed additions at a number of existing hospitals, and the\nmaturation of newly opened locations.\n\u2022\nOperational Initiatives. Our priorities include operational initiatives that build on momentum from recent years. We\nbelieve our care coordination efforts have and will continue to contribute to fewer discharges to skilled nursing\nfacilities, more discharges to community, and improved patient experience. Our care coordination program is the\nintegrative approach to a patient\u2019s care that includes coordination with physicians, acute-care hospitals, and other post-\nacute providers to ensure the best overall care is provided to the patient.\nWe will continue to demonstrate our value proposition to Medicare Advantage payors by providing superior patient\noutcomes, including higher discharge to community rates and lower lengths of stay, compared to alternative sites of\ncare. The Medicare Advantage enrollment growth rate is greater than that of traditional Medicare fee-for-service, and\nour payor mix has shifted accordingly. Medicare Advantage payors represented 8.4% of our net operating revenues in\n2017 and 16.2% in 2023. We believe our outcomes and quality of care data have helped drive a significant\nimprovement in the payments we receive from Medicare Advantage payors. For example, reimbursement based on the\ntype of patient/treatment required, commonly referred to as the case mix group basis (\u201cCMG\u201d), is typically greater\nthan reimbursement on a per-diem rate basis, and we increased the percentage of our Medicare Advantage revenue\npaid based on CMG from approximately 58% in 2017 to approximately 90% in 2023.\nGiven the significant number of stroke patients in need of post-acute care, we will continue working to build our stroke\nmarket share through our strategic sponsorship of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, the\nIRF treatment recommendations published by the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs and the Journal of the American\nMedical Association, our care coordination, and our hospitals\u2019 participation in The Joint Commission\u2019s Disease-\nSpecific Care Certification Program. As of December 31, 2023, 136 of our 161 hospitals held stroke-specific\ncertifications that required us to demonstrate effective use of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to manage and\noptimize stroke care and an organized approach to performance measurement and evaluation of clinical outcomes.

{"query": "<image><image><image>Context:\n\n60\n\u25cf\nAt the San Jos\u00e9 Mine, Q4/23 production improved by 9% compared to Q3/23 due to a modest\nimprovement in processed tonnes. However, MSC\u2019s annual production was 5% lower than prior year,\nprimarily due to lower gold and silver head grades. MSC produced 19,155 attributable GEOs in Q4/23 and\n65,673 attributable GEOs in full year 2023 from the San Jos\u00e9 mine(1).\n\u25cf\nMcEwen Copper announced the results of an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) and\nInitial Assessment (\u201cIA\u201d) on the Los Azules copper project which were updated and \ufb01led as an exhibit to the 8-\nK dated October 3, 2023. The independently prepared mineral resource estimate increased to 10.9 billion lbs of\nCu (Indicated, grade 0.40%) and 26.7 billion lbs of Cu (Inferred, grade 0.31%). The base case economic model\nfor Los Azules now indicates a 27-year mine life with an after-tax net present value of $2.7 billion at an 8%\ndiscount rate, with a payback period of 3.2 years.\n\u25cf\nMcEwen Copper continued to advance its exploration program at Los Azules.  The 2022-2023 drilling\nprogram concluded on June 19, 2023, coinciding with the onset of winter in San Juan, Argentina. During this\nexploration season, 15 drill rigs completed approximately 131,000 feet (39,900 meters) of drilling across 138\nholes to evaluate geotechnical, hydrological, metallurgical, resource, and exploration-related parameters and\nopportunities. In the current drilling season for 2023-2024, McEwen Copper is targeting 157,000 feet (48,000\nmeters) of infill resource drilling. Over 74,000 feet (22,627 meters) was drilled in Q4/23.\n\u25cf\nWe continue to meet safety expectations at our 100% owned operations. During Q4/23, we did not have\nany lost-time incidents at our Fox Complex, Gold Bar Mine, and El Gallo operations.\nFinancial Highlights\n\u25cf\nWe reported consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $23.0 million and consolidated working capital of $22.7\nmillion as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $39.8 million and negative $2.5 million, respectively).\n\u25cf\nRevenue of $166.2 million was reported for full year 2023 from the sale of 88,699 GEOs from our 100% owned\noperations at an average realized price(2) of $1,927 per GEO. This compares to revenue of $110.4 million from\nthe sale of 63,825 GEOs from our 100% owned operations at an average realized price(2) of $1,788 per GEO\nduring full year 2022.\n\u25cf\nWe reported a gross pro\ufb01t of $17.8 million and cash gross pro\ufb01t (2) of $47.0 million for full year 2023, compared\nwith gross loss of $0.5 million and cash gross pro\ufb01t(2) of $19.2 million for full year 2022. Higher revenues, driven\nby a 34% increase in GEOs sold and an 8% increase in realized gold prices drove improvements in gross pro\ufb01t\nand cash gross pro\ufb01t. Including our 49% ownership of San Jos\u00e9 mine, we reported a total cash gross pro\ufb01t(2) for\nfull year 2023 of $85.1 million compared with $54.7 million for full year 2022.  \n\u25cf\nNet income for full year 2023 was $55.3 million, or $1.16 per share, compared to net loss of $81.1 million, or\n$1.71 per share for full year 2022. Our net income for full year 2023 was driven primarily by $222.2 million\naccounting gain recognized on the deconsolidation of McEwen Copper.\n\u25cf\nWe reported an adjusted net loss(2) of $23.0 million, or $0.48 per share for full year 2023 compared with an\nadjusted net loss(2) of $17.0 million, or $0.36 per share for full year 2022. Adjusted net loss (2) excludes the\nimpact of the results of McEwen Copper and MSC, and we believe this metric best represents the results of our\n100% owned precious metal operations.\n\u25cf\nCash costs(2) and AISC(2) per GEO sold for the Fox Complex for full year 2023 were $1,157 and $1,351,\nrespectively, which compared against full year 2023 guidance of $1,020 and $1,465, respectively.

See \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\u201d for a reconciliation to gross pro\ufb01t\n(loss), which we consider to be the nearest GAAP measure beginning on page 76.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we reported a net income of $55.3 million (or $1.16 per share) compared to a net\nloss of $81.1 million (or $1.71 per share) for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by an\naccounting gain recognized on the deconsolidation of McEwen Copper of $222.2 million. In addition, our revenues\nincreased by $55.8 million, driven by a 14.2% increase in GEOs sold and a higher average realized gold price compared\nto 2022. Partially o\ufb00setting these e\ufb00ects was a $28.0 million increase in our cost of sales, attributed to higher processed\nmineralized material, a $60.1 million loss recognized on our investment in McEwen Copper resulting from the impact of\nexploration expenditure, and a $37.8 million deferred income tax expense on our investments in McEwen Copper.\nWe reported an adjusted net loss of $23.0 million (or $0.48 per share) in 2023 compared to an adjusted net loss of $17.0\nmillion (or $0.36 per share) in 2022. Our adjusted net income excludes the impact of McEwen Copper and MSC\u2019s results\non our net income. We believe this metric best represents the results of our 100% owned precious metal operations.\nProduction from our 100% owned mines of 88,915 GEOs in full year 2023 increased by 24,696 GEOs as compared to\n64,219 GEOs produced in full year 2022. At our Fox Complex operations, production increased by 7,739 GEOs in 2023\nas compared to 2022 as a result of an increase in processed mineralized material, while at Gold Bar our production\nincreased by 17,059 GEOs as a result of higher average head grades and a significant increase in processed tonnes.\n\n\n63\nOur attributable share of the San Jos\u00e9 mine production was 65,673 GEOs in 2023, which was 5% lower than 69,129\nGEOs produced in 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower average gold and silver head grades year over\nyear.\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS REVIEW\nRevenue from gold and silver sales: For the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue from 100% owned operations\nincreased to $166.2 million, compared with $110.4 million in 2022. This 51% increase was driven by year-over-year\nproduction improvements at both of our 100% owned operations totaling 88,699 GEOs sold as well as an increase in\naverage realized gold prices. Our average realized price in 2023 was $1,927 per GEO, compared with $1,788 per GEO in\n2022.  \nProduction costs applicable to sales: For the year ended December 31, 2023, production costs applicable to sales\nincreased to $119.2 million, compared with $91.3 million in 2022. This 31% increase was primarily driven by the increase\nin GEOs sold.\nAdvanced project costs: Advanced project costs of $82.6 million in full year 2023 increased by $15.9 million compared to\nfull year 2022. Prior to our deconsolidation, the Company spent $80.0 million at the Los Azules project in Argentina\nprimarily to advance to feasibility. The remaining $6.3 million was related to the further advancement of Fenix Project in\nMexico.\nExploration costs: Exploration costs of $20.2 million in full year 2023 increased by $5.2 million compared to full year 2022.\nExploration expenditures of $13.6 million were incurred to advance our Stock West project at the Fox Complex.  At our\nGold Bar mine, we incurred $6.2 million of exploration costs primarily focused on de\ufb01ning the boundaries of our oxide pit\nlimit.\nLoss from investment in McEwen Copper: For full year 2023, we recorded a loss of $57.8 million from our investments in\nMcEwen Copper. This loss represents our proportion of McEwen Copper\u2019s net loss, which is driven primarily by\nexploration expenditure.\nIncome from investment in MSC : For full year 2023, we recorded an income of $0.1 million from our investments in MSC,\ncompared with $2.8 million income recorded in full year 2022. This decrease was a result of year-over-year declines in\nsilver and gold average head grades, impacting revenue, as well as higher depreciation and depletion. Details of MSC\u2019s\noperating results are presented in the \u201cOperations Review\u201d section of this MDA and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nInterest and other \ufb01nance income, net : Net interest and other \ufb01nance income of $36.9 million in full year 2023 increased\nby $44.7 million compared to an expense of $7.8 million in full year 2022. This change was driven by an increase in the\nCompany\u2019s average cash balance held in money market funds following the McEwen Copper \ufb01nancing in Q1/23, and\ntogether with our investments in equity securities in Argentina, served to mitigate impacts of foreign currency devaluation\non our financial statements prior to our deconsolidation of McEwen Copper.\nOther expense: Other expenses of $30.0 million in full year 2023 decreased from income of $22.9 million in full year 2022\ndue to devaluation of cash holdings denominated in ARS against USD. This is discussed further in Note 4 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements. As described above, McEwen Copper used money market funds and equity\ninstruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency devaluation in Argentina.\nGain on deconsolidation of McEwen Copper: In Q4/2023, the Company recognized an accounting gain due to the\ndeconsolidation of McEwen Copper of approximately $222.2 million, which is included in other income on the Statement\nof Operations. This is discussed further in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome and mining tax recovery (expense) : For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $33.9 million\nin income tax expense, compared to $5.8 million of income tax expense for the full year 2022, primarily due to the\ndeconsolidation of McEwen Copper and subsequent recognition of deferred income tax liability of $37.8 million, that was\n\n\n67\n2023 compared to 2022\nThe Gold Bar mine produced 19,797 and 43,678 GEOs in Q4/23 and full year 2023, respectively. This represents a 149%\nand 64% increase from 7,943 and 26,619 GEOs produced in Q4/22 and full year 2022, respectively. The substantial\nincrease in both quarterly and annual production was the result of the completion and commissioning of the heap leach\npad expansion in October 2023, an improvement in ore stacked and placed under leach, and consistent performance\nfrom our mine contractor and crushing operation.\nFurthermore, issues with carbonaceous gold bearing material experienced in 2022 did not a\ufb00ect our 2023 production, as\na revised mine plan completed in Q4/22 identi\ufb01ed and excluded such material. Carbonaceous material has been\nstockpiled separately from waste, and alternative treatment technologies are being reviewed and tested to determine if it\nis economically viable to recover gold from this material in the future.\nRevenue from gold and silver sales  was $37.9 million in Q4/23 compared to $13.6 million in Q4/22. The increase in\nrevenue was the result of higher GEOs sold during Q4/23 (19,245 GEOs in Q4/23 compared to 8,000 GEOs in Q4/22)\ntogether with a higher average realized gold price ($1,956 per GEO in Q4/23 compared with $1,674 per GEO in Q4/22).\nRevenue from gold and silver sales was $83.4 million for full year 2023 compared to $47.9 million for full year 2022, with\nthe increase driven by both higher GEO sales (43,034 GEO in 2023 compared to 26,810 GEO in 2022), and higher\nrealized gold prices ( $1,927 per GEO in 2023 compared with $1,788 per GEO in 2022).\nProduction costs applicable to sales were $25.9 million in Q4/23 compared to $8.7 million in Q4/22. The increase was\ndriven primarily by higher GEOs sold as described above. Production costs applicable to sales were $67.3 million for full\nyear 2023, compared to $43.5 million for full year 2022. The $23.8 million increase in costs year over year was the result\nof higher sales, o\ufb00set by lower realized operating costs due to higher mine contractor productivity, and the absence of\ncosts associated with adjustments to the mine plan in 2022 to account for the higher than anticipated carbonaceous\nmaterial encountered.\nCash cost and AISC per GEO  sold were $1,345 and $1,506 in Q4/23, respectively, compared to $1,083 and $1,395 in\nQ4/22, respectively. The increase in cash costs was driven by higher year-over-year mining costs as a result of lower\nmining activity in Q4/22 while Gold Bar onboarded our current mining contractor. AISC for the period was higher than\nQ4/22, largely driven by higher mining costs, partially o\ufb00set by lower capital expenditures. During Q4/23, capital projects\nconsisted of the completion of the heap leach pad expansion, compared to Q4/22 where capital was spent on determining\nthe extent of carbonaceous material in the Pick Pit.\nCash cost and AISC per GEO  sold were $1,565 and $1,891 for full year 2023, respectively, compared to $1,622 and\n$1,989 for full year 2022, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in AISC per GEO sold was driven by improved mine\ncontractor productivity, which directly increased GEOs sold.\nExploration Activities\nDuring Q4/23 drilling was focused on the Cabin Creek Complex and Pot Canyon target, following up positive near surface\nexploration work and mapping done in Q4/22. At Cabin Creek, drilling tested open mineralization southwest of Cabin\nNorth Pit, and a northeastern trending shear zone in the northern wall of the Cabin South pit. Strong gold mineralization\nwas encountered in these zones and will be an area of focus in 2024. At Pot Canyon drilling was focused on determining\ngeologic structure and targeting a favorable rock unit (Bartine) at depth. Drilling at Pot Canyon yielded some technical\nsuccess, intersecting elevated levels of gold, however, there is no work planned for 2024.\nDuring 2023, a total of 121 holes were drilled for a total of 68,020 feet at Cabin and Pot Canyon. Additional drilling was\ncompleted at Cabin North and South, and at Gold Bar South to further delineate mineralized zones, and increase the\ncon\ufb01dence in the resource estimate, respectively. De-risking drilling was also conducted on the East Pick area of the\nPick Pit, to improve resource definition, and location of gold bearing carbonaceous material within the pit area.\n\n\n71\nMSC Segment, Argentina\nThe MSC segment is comprised of a 49% interest in the San Jos\u00e9 mine, located in Santa Cruz, Argentina.\nMSC \u2013 Operating Results\nThe following table sets out operating results for the San Jos\u00e9 mine for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and\n2022, and for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (on a 100% basis):\nThree months ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\n    \n2023     \n2022     \n2023     \n2022  \n2021\nOperating Results\n(in thousands, except otherwise indicated)\nSan Jos\u00e9 Mine\u2014100% basis\nMined mineralized material (t)\n \n 173  \n 150  \n 563  \n 555  \n 532\nAverage grade mined (g/t)\nGold\n \n 4.69  \n 5.00  \n 4.83  \n 5.00  \n 5.4\nSilver\n \n 274  \n 320  \n 270  \n 345  \n 353\nProcessed mineralized material (t)\n \n 154  \n 153  \n 579  \n 507  \n 539\nAverage grade processed (g/t)\nGold\n \n 5.5  \n 5.4  \n 5.0  \n 5.6  \n 5.5\nSilver\n \n 297  \n 332  \n 270  \n 369  \n 344\nAverage recovery (%):\nGold\n \n 87.2  \n 86.3  \n 86.5  \n 87.0  \n 88.1\nSilver\n \n 88.1  \n 87.8  \n 88.0  \n 88.0  \n 88.0\nGold ounces:\nProduced\n \n 23.8  \n 22.8  \n 81.0  \n 78.8  \n 83.6\nSold\n \n 23.4  \n 22.5  \n 75.1  \n 77.2  \n 81.8\nSilver ounces:\nProduced\n \n 1,297  \n 1,430  \n 4,422  \n 5,292  \n 5,250\nSold\n \n 1,384  \n 1,435  \n 4,363  \n 5,303  \n 5,229\nGEOs:\nProduced\n \n 39.1  \n 39.6  \n 134.0  \n 141.1  \n 156.8\nSold\n \n 39.7  \n 39.3  \n 127.3  \n 139.5  \n 155.3\nRevenue from gold and silver sales\n$\n 76,979\n$\n 77,890\n$  242,461\n$  254,698\n$  271,863\nAverage realized price:\nGold ($/Au oz)\n$\n 1,941\n$\n 1,988\n$\n 1,985\n$\n 1,826\n$\n 1,760\nSilver ($/Ag oz)\n$\n 22.81\n$\n 23.16\n$\n 21.43\n$\n 21.45\n$\n 24.45\nCash costs(1)\n$\n 45,800\n$\n 51,963\n$  177,234\n$  182,195\n$  196,032\nCash cost per ounce sold ($/GEO)(1)\n$\n 1,155\n$\n 1,321\n$\n 1,393\n$\n 1,306\n$\n 1,262\nAll\u2011in sustaining costs(1)\n$\n 59,441\n$\n 66,939\n$  231,548\n$  239,146\n$  249,018\nAISC per ounce sold ($/GEO)(1)\n$\n 1,499\n$\n 1,701\n$\n 1,820\n$\n 1,714\n$\n 1,603\nGold : Silver ratio\n85 : 1\n \n85 : 1\n \n83 : 1\n \n84 : 1\n72 : 1\n(1)\nAs used here and elsewhere in this report, this is a Non-GAAP \ufb01nancial performance measure.

{"query": "<image><image>Context:\n\nfor components with standard pin spacings of 2.54mm.\nPick and place component criteria: We evaluated the criteria under which LaserFactory\ncan pick and place components. First, components require a minimum flat surface area of\n3x3mm above the component\u2019s center of mass for the suction tip\u2019s 2.5mm diameter nozzle\nto form a good contact. We found this could be increased or decreased by increasing or\ndecreasing the diameter of the pick-and-place nozzle, respectively. Second, components must\nhave a mass smaller than 65g for the pump suction to lift them. This threshold allows lifting\nlarge components, such as an Arduino Mega micro-controller (37g). A stronger pump could\nfurther raise this threshold. Third, their height cannot exceed 27 mm, currently limited by\nthe maximum extension of the linear potentiometer used to assess picking height. Given these\nconstraints, LaserFactory can pick large, heavy components, such as typical 3V batteries;\ntall components such as rotors; and a variety of small components, such as SMD resistors\ndown to size 2010. For future work, these constraints can be further lifted by using a smaller\nnozzle, larger pump, and longer lead screw.\nUse over time: During the course of fabrication, the peak power draw measured from\nthe two on-board parallel 9V lithium ion batteries was 13.5W. Between no-load cases of\ncutting/folding and variable-load cases of PCB-making, this is sufficient for approximately\n4 hours of continuous device creation. We detected no irregularities in laser carriage motion\nthat would indicate undue stress on the laser cutter during use.\n3.2\nLaser sintering: Curing Circuit Traces using a CO2\nlaser\nWhen both the silver paste has been deposited and the components have been placed onto\na substrate in the laser cutter, the silver is not yet conductive, nor does it rigidly bond\ncomponents to the substrate. For this, the silver requires curing via heating, traditionally\nachieved via baking the created device in an oven before it becomes functional. However, this\nhas several drawbacks, such as that the heat in the oven can damage the material substrate\nand the electronic components due to the thermal stresses. To solve this issue, we developed\na technique that uses the laser to cure the circuit traces and connect components electrically.\nA benefit of using the laser is that it allows for a fully integrated fabrication process with no\nmanual work required. In addition, heat is only applied locally to traces and thus affects the\nmaterial sheet only in the locations of the trace. Finally, using the laser is fast, approximately\n5 minutes in contrast to the 2 hours achieved via uniform heating in an oven [15]. Once the\nlast circuit trace is cured, the device is functional right off the fabrication bed.\n3.2.1\nFabrication Settings for Laser Sintering\nWe ran a set of experiments to determine the best power, speed, and z-axis settings for\ncuring silver traces. For the experiments, we used a Universal Laser Systems ULS.PLS.150D\nlaser cutter equipped with a 2.0 inch lens. For the silver, we used the silver paste from\nSunChemical (C2180423D2), which has a composition of 56.69% 24K silver and 43.31% a\nblend of resin and solvents.\n43\n\n\nof our pick-and-place mechanism with a laser cutter. In addition to placing electrical com-\nponents on a device, we can also pick-and-place pieces of the material substrate. To harvest\nthese pieces, shapes are first cut from the substrate and then the pick-and-place is used to\nstack them to create 3D structures (Figure 3.4b). By discretizing a structure into layers,\nthese layers can be cut using a focused laser, stacked via pick-and-place, and welded using a\ndefocused laser [113] to produce rigid 3D structures without manual intervention.\nFigure 3.4: LaserFactory can be used to create (a) 2.5D geometries via folding, (b) as well\nas discretized 3D geometries via cutting and pick-and-placing the material substrate itself.\n3.3\nAugmenting a Laser Cutter Through Motion-Based\nSignaling\nAugmenting existing fabrication devices reduces engineering effort by piggy-backing exist-\ning platforms rather than building hardware/software from scratch, and by making the new\nfunctionality available to a wide range of users who already own or operate the platform.\nHowever, interfacing with a commercial fabrication platform that is not built to accommodate\nan expansion of its functionality is challenging [15]. In building our hardware augmentation\nto a laser head, we investigated solutions that do not require access to the proprietary soft-\nware of the fabrication platform and that therefore could potentially be platform-agnostic to\npermit augmenting a range of different fabrication devices. To this end, our method involves\ntwo primary stages. First, our method embeds additional lines in the fabrication file. These\ninclude additional paths such as trajectories for navigating between electrical components,\nand also specific motion patterns that signal instructions to the add-on. Second, our method\ndetects these motion patterns using a motion-based classifer based on accelerometer data\nrunning locally on the add-on. Our method to transmit fabrication instructions thereby re-\nlies only on the fabrication platform\u2019s ability to execute motion in the X-Y plane; the add-on\nhas no explicit knowledge of the contents of the fabrication file itself. In the next section,\nwe provide more details on how we create the additional lines to produce carriage motion of\nthe laser cutter and how we signal the transition between different fabrication stages using\nthe motion patterns in the design file.\n46\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Functional Devices made with LaserFactory: (a) a quadcopter that can lift\nof the fabrication platform, (b) a sensor-equipped wristband capable of gesture recognition,\nand (c) a printed circuit board, specifically an H bridge.\ncreated capacitive sensors from traces themselves, showing how simple touch and humidity\nsensors as well as antennae can be fabricated without the need to procure dedicated external\ncomponents.\n3.5.3\nPrinted circuit boards\nWe fabricated an H bridge motor driver as an individual PCB (Figure 3.11c). H bridges are\ncircuits used to switch the polarity of a load, allowing them to directly drive a DC motor\nbidirectionally. They are frequently used by hobbyists and electronic novices because micro-\ncontrollers, such as the Arduino platform, cannot drive motors directly from their pins. The\nH bridge takes 12 minutes to fabricate and is made up of 13 components: two PNP transis-\ntors, two NPN transistors, four resistors and five female header connectors. These connectors\nare used to easily mate with the four required control signals and a motor. This application\ndemonstrates LaserFactory\u2019s capability to create ICs from basic SMD components, such as\ntransistors and resistors. Since transistors and resistors can be used to create a variety of\ndifferent ICs with different functionality (e.g., H bridges, Op Amps), this example showcases\nthat LaserFactory can create a diverse set of devices even when only basic components are\nloaded into the component storage area. Thus, rather than ordering the ICs, LaserFactory\ncan make them on demand. Moreover, as a single fabrication file encodes all fabrication\ninstructions, such files can be easily shared and downloaded in order to fabricate PCBs that\nother experts have designed.\n3.6\nDiscussion\nWe next discuss design decisions and their limitations for the LaserFactory system and\ncomment on opportunities for improvements.\nTransferability between different laser cutters: Just as power, speed and height settings\nmust be characterized for cutting the same material on two different laser cutters, the same\nis true for the settings of the LaserFactory add-on. The laser cutter settings in Table 3.1,\n3D printed clips for mounting the add-on, and the motion signal used are all calibrated for\nuse on our specific laser cutter machine, i.e. the ULS.PLS.150D system. Thus, the settings\nneed to be re-calibrated to work with the specific laser power, laser head shape, and carriage\n56\n\n\nmotion that is expected to differ between machines. Underlying this is the requirement for\nthe firmware to allow reading an SVG/PDF file line by line, and to not automatically smooth\nall accelerations. For laser sintering, we tested and confirmed its compatibility with a range\nof power, speed and height permutations. This suggests that laser cutters within a range\nof power ratings could potentially be compatible for use with laser sintering as long as they\nhave an adjustable platform height. While outside the scope of our work, it would be an\nimportant future work to validate this cross-device functioning.\nUnidirectional communication: The platform agnosticism gained by leveraging unidirec-\ntional communications comes with the trade-off that LaserFactory is not set up to transmit\ninstructions back to the laser cutter firmware. In its current state, this prevents LaserFactory\nfrom being able to communicate interrupts to the laser cutter software to allow for potential\ninterventions. Such interrupts would be useful to allow aborting fabrication in cases of mal-\nfunction or an unexpected contact detected by the pick-and-place sensor. One method of\nenabling bidirectional communication would be to fit the hardware add-on with an onboard\ntransceiver, however interfacing it with laser cutter firmware would necessarily be platform\nspecific.\nComponent Loading: In the current version of LaserFactory, we use a pre-loaded compo-\nnent storage inside the laser cutter that users can re-stock as needed. The storage consists of\nengraved footprints of electronic components that help the user align them correctly during\nloading. LaserFactory uses these positions to compute paths for the pick and place opera-\ntions. The current system thus relies on foreknowledge about what components will be used.\nFor future work, we plan to investigate how we can enable pre-stocking of a larger number\nof components and how to feed in components on-demand to accommodate real-time design\ndecisions. In addition, LaserFactory\u2019s hardware currently does not support electronic com-\nponent rotation. Thus, the orientation of pre-stocked components must match that of their\nvirtual counterparts. For future work, we plan to add a rotation axis to the pick-and-place\ntool to extend the degrees of freedom available to designers. We also plan to investigate\nstocking material sheet in the component storage area, which can be cut and stacked to\nform multimaterial structures.\nOn-Demand Device Programming: The microcontrollers that are picked-and-placed as\npart of the fabrication process are currently manually pre-programmed ahead of time, re-\nquiring foreknowledge of the device in which they will be used and its context. For future\nwork, we plan to explore methods for flashing programs on-demand to accommodate more\nversatile deployment; a promising candidate for this could be programming via infrared\nreceivers (Kilobots [139]).\n3.7\nSummary\nIn this chapter, we presented LaserFactory, an integrated fabrication platform that can\nrapidly create the geometry of a device, create its circuit traces and assemble components\nwithout manual intervention. We demonstrated how we can augment an existing laser cutter\nwith a hardware add-on without interfacing with its underlying firmware by using a motion-\nbased signaling technique that can inform the add-on when to start and stop its operation.\nWe illustrated the two main features of our hardware add-on, a silver dispenser used for\n57\n\n\nChapter 8\nDiscussion and Future Work\nThe ability to manufacture and assemble customized artefacts at points of need can signif-\nicantly enhance our ability to meet the technical and personal needs of diverse populations\nand use cases, respond rapidly to unforeseen events, and address critical gaps in supply chain\nsecurity. Towards that end, this thesis has introduced a set of consolidated manufacturing\ntechniques capable of assembling physical artefacts in situ. These techniques were parti-\ntioned into three classes of strategy: (1) multi-process manufacturing machines, (2) modular\nassembly platforms, and (3) programmable materials. Together, these illustrated how au-\ntomating fabrication in situ can be accomplished at three complementary levels: at the\nmachine level, the part level, and at the material level. In addition to showcasing hardware\nplatforms for each class, I introduced custom software tools that showed how non-expert end\nusers can design and define assembly protocols for each system. We used these platforms to\ndemonstrate fabrication of advanced, functional artefacts across both scales and use cases,\nincluding robots and space structures.\nBelow, I summarize the thesis and point toward\nfuture work.\n8.0.1\nSummary of Thesis and Contributions\nIn Chapter 3, we introduced a multi-process manufacturing machine called LaserFactory, an\nintegrated fabrication platform that can rapidly create the geometry of a device, create its\ncircuit traces and assemble components without manual intervention. We demonstrated how\nwe can augment an existing laser cutter with a hardware add-on without interfacing with its\nunderlying firmware by using a motion-based signaling technique that can inform the add-on\nwhen to start and stop its operation. We illustrated the two main features of our hardware\nadd-on, a silver dispenser used for circuit trace creation and a pick-and-place mechanism used\nfor assembling electronic components, and showed that the add-on can create high-resolution\ntraces of high conductivity and assemble a range of different electronic components. We then\nshowcased laser sintering, a technique that uses a CO2 laser to cure dispensed silver paste and\ndiscussed which laser cutter settings are most suitable to cure the traces. Finally, we showed\nour end-to-end design and fabrication pipeline consisting of a design tool, a visualization\ntool, and a post-processing script that transforms the design file into machine instructions\nfor LaserFactory. We also showed example applications that included a quadcopter with\nactuators, a sensor-enhanced wristband, and a PCB assembled from basic transistors and\n111\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the potential improvements that could be made to the LaserFactory's pick-and-place system to enhance its capability to handle a wider range of components, and how might these improvements address the current limitations?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/a58b8d1491b01e9e377e42ce6ca1bf1e.png", "data/qwen_images/83b4bc2ad99392d2b1eb31e35979d53c.png"]}
{"query": "<image><image><image><image>Context:\n\n\u00a0\ncustomers are generally incurred up front, while revenue is recognized ratably over the term of our subscription services. Alternatively, to the extent we are \nunsuccessful in increasing our customer base, we could also incur increased losses as costs associated with marketing programs and new products intended to \nattract new customers would not be offset by incremental revenue and cash flow. Changes in economic conditions may financially impact our existing and \nprospective customers and cause them to delay or reduce their technology spending, which may adversely affect our ability to attract new customers. For \nexample, our business has been impacted by pressure from customers\u2019 lower headcount growth and greater budget scrutiny on IT decisions since the second half \nof fiscal year 2023. All of these factors could negatively impact our future revenue and operating results.\nAdverse economic conditions have in the past and may in the future result in reduced sales, longer sales cycles, reduced renewal rates, slower adoption of \nnew technologies and increased price competition, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for cloud content management services and on the economic health of our current and prospective \ncustomers. The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time that have resulted in a significant \nweakening of the economy, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, and other difficulties that may affect the \nindustries to which we sell our services. An economic downturn, recession, or uncertainty about economic conditions, including volatility in the credit, equity \nand foreign exchange markets, inflation, rising interest rates, potential United States (U.S.) sovereign default, bank failures and financial instability, ongoing \nsupply chain disruptions, unemployment trends, the adverse effects of pandemics and geopolitical issues, such as the Hamas-Israel and Russia-Ukraine \nconflicts, could cause customers to delay or reduce their information technology spending. This has in the past and may in the future result in reduced sales, \nlonger sales cycles, reduced renewal rates, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition. Any of these events would likely have an \nadverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position. Since the second half of our fiscal year 2023, we have seen an impact from additional \ncustomer scrutiny being placed on deals due to the economic environment. In addition, there can be no assurance that cloud content management and \ncollaboration spending levels will increase following any recovery.\nIf we are not able to successfully launch new products and services or provide enhancements or new features to our existing products and services, our \nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nOur industry is marked by rapid technological developments and new and enhanced applications and services. If we are unable to enhance our existing \nservices or offer new services that achieve market acceptance or keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be adversely affected. \nThe success of any new services or enhancements to our existing services, such as Box AI and Box Hubs, depends on several factors, including their timely \ncompletion, introduction and market acceptance. We also may experience business or economic disruptions that could adversely affect the productivity of our \nemployees and result in delays in our product development process. We maintain a hybrid workforce (with a mix of employees working from offices and others \nworking remotely), which may lead to disruptions and decreased productivity that could result in delays in our product development process. Failure in this \nregard may significantly impair our revenue growth and our future financial results. Our product development efforts could also be impacted by our workforce \nlocation strategy as we hire an increasing number of our employees in countries such as Poland and the Netherlands. In addition, because our services are \ndesigned to operate on a variety of systems, we must continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, \nmobile operating systems, and other software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in developing these modifications \nand enhancements or bringing them to market in a timely fashion, which may negatively impact our customer renewal rates, limit the market for our solutions, \nor impair our ability to attract new customers. Furthermore, modifications to existing platforms or technologies will increase our research and development \nexpenses. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with existing or future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, \nresult in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.\n20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2022\nweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual \nproperty and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors, including economic tariffs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the geopolitical environment, the perception of doing business with U.S. based companies, and changes in regulatory requirements \nthat impact our operating strategies, access to global markets or hiring;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, \ntax, AI, privacy and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party resellers and other parties;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nunstable regional, economic, social and political conditions, such as the Hamas-Israel and Russia-Ukraine conflicts.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our operating results or financial position.\nWe sell our services and incur operating expenses in various currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the relative value of the U.S. dollar and foreign \ncurrencies, particularly the Japanese Yen, and to a lesser extent, the British pound and the Euro, may impact our operating results. For example, the Japanese \nYen, the British pound and the Euro have all experienced declines in value vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar, which negatively affected our results of operations during \nthe year ended January 31, 2024 and could continue to negatively impact our results of operations in future periods. We currently primarily manage our \nexchange rate risk by maintaining offsetting foreign currency assets and liabilities and by minimizing non-U.S. dollar cash balances, and we plan to implement \nhedging programs in fiscal year 2025 to further mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Such practices may not ultimately be available and/or effective at \nmitigating the foreign currency risk to which we are exposed. If we are unsuccessful in detecting material exposures in a timely manner, any hedging strategies \nwe deploy are not effective, or there are no hedging strategies available for certain exposures that are prudent given the associated risks and the potential \nmitigation of the underlying exposure achieved, our operating results or financial position could be negatively affected in the future.\nIf we are unable to maintain and promote our brand, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and promoting our brand is critical to expanding our customer base. Maintaining and promoting our brand will depend \nlargely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable and innovative services, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new features, \nproducts, services or terms of service that our customers do not like, which may negatively affect our brand and reputation. Additionally, the actions of third \nparties may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience using third-party apps or other services that are integrated with Box. \nMaintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not achieve the desired goals. If we fail to \nsuccessfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of cumulative losses, and we may not be able to sustain profitable growth.\nWe generated net income of $129.0 million and $26.8 million during the years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and incurred a net loss of \n$41.5 million during the year ended January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion. The loss in fiscal year 2022 and \nrelated accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we made to acquire new customers and develop our services. We intend to \n23\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe $5.2 million, or 2%, increase during the fiscal year was primarily due to increases of $6.9 million and $5.0 million in allocated overhead costs and \nemployee related costs, respectively, driven by a 4% increase in headcount, $3.8 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $1.2 million in subscription \nsoftware contract expenses. The increased employee headcount and related costs are driven by the growth in lower cost regions. This increase was partially \noffset by an increase of $9.9 million in capitalized internally developed software costs and a decrease of $1.8 million in public cloud hosting costs. Research \nand development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 60 basis points year-over-year. \nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we continue to \nmake significant improvements to our content cloud product offerings and services and shift research and development to lower cost regions.\nSales and Marketing\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n$ Change\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n% Change\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(dollars in thousands)\n\u00a0\nSales and marketing\n\u00a0 $\n348,638 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n331,400 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n17,238 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n5 %\nPercentage of revenue\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n33.6 % \u00a0 \u00a0\n33.4 % \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe $17.2 million, or 5%, increase during the fiscal year was primarily due to increases of $7.4 million in stock-based compensation expense and $3.2 \nmillion and $1.6 million in allocated overhead costs and employee related costs, respectively, driven by a 1% increase in headcount. Additionally, there were \nincreases of $2.9 million  in marketing expenses, driven by increased costs related to marketing events, and $0.6 million in commission expenses. Sales and \nmarketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 20 basis points year-over-year.\nWe expect to continue to invest in capturing our large market opportunity globally and capitalize on our competitive position with a continued focus on \nour profitability objectives. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as our \nexisting customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments and as we \ncontinue to focus on improving sales productivity.\nGeneral and Administrative\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n$ Change\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n% Change\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(dollars in thousands)\n\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative\n\u00a0 $\n128,971 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n126,549 \u00a0\n\u00a0 $\n2,422 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n2 %\nPercentage of revenue\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n12.4 % \u00a0 \u00a0\n12.8 % \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe $2.4 million, or 2%, increase during the fiscal year was primarily due to increases of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 \nmillion in subscription software contract expenses.

The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows \nduring this period were our net income of $129.0 million, stock-based compensation of $198.8 million, amortization of deferred commissions of $54.2 million, \nand depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and capitalized software of $51.2 million, partially offset by a non-cash income tax benefit \nfrom the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $75.2 million. Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended January 31, 2024 \nwas further adjusted by net cash outflows of $41.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. \nThe primary drivers for the changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $49.3 million decrease in operating lease liabilities due to recurring lease \npayments, a $44.5 million increase in deferred commissions resulting from capitalization of incremental commissions paid to our sales force, and a $21.9 \nmillion increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of our cash collections. This was partially offset by a $35.2 million decrease in operating \nright-of-use assets due to amortization, a $32.7 million increase in deferred revenue, and a $6.8 million decrease in other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities of $82.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by $169.4 million in purchases of short-term \ninvestments that were partially offset by $108.0 million in maturities of short-term investments, $16.6 million in capitalized internally developed software costs, \n$2.7 million in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $1.8 million of fixed asset purchases, net of sale proceeds.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities of $272.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by $177.1 million in repurchases of our \ncommon stock, $74.7 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock awards, $30.2 million of principal payments of finance \nlease liabilities, and $14.9 million of dividend payments to preferred stockholders. This was partially offset by $28.2 million from issuances of common stock \nunder our employee equity plans.\nDebt\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026. The Convertible Notes \nare senior unsecured obligations and do not bear regular interest. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes is convertible into 38.7962 shares of \nour Class A common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $25.78 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified \nevents.

{"query": "Context:\n\n6\t \t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \nFORM 10-K PART I\nWe completed and began producing oil and natural gas from 222 gross (99.6 net) horizontal wells in the Delaware \nBasin in 2023, including 119 gross (94.0 net) operated and 103 gross (5.6 net) non-operated wells. At December 31, \n2023, our total acreage position in the Delaware Basin was approximately 265,600 gross (152,200 net) acres, \nprimarily in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving and Ward Counties, \nTexas. We have focused our \nDelaware Basin operations on the following asset areas: the Stateline, Rustler Breaks and Arrowhead asset areas \nin Eddy County, New Mexico, the Antelope Ridge, Ranger and Twin Lakes asset areas in Lea County, New Mexico \nand the West Texas asset area in Loving and Ward Counties, \nTexas. Our Delaware Basin properties are the most \nsignificant component of our asset portfolio. Our average daily oil equivalent production from the Delaware Basin \nincreased approximately 27% to 126,720 BOE per day (96% of total oil equivalent production), including 74,697 Bbl of \noil per day (99% of total oil production) and 312.1 MMcf of natural gas per day (92% of total natural gas production), \nin 2023, as compared to 100,135 BOE per day (95% of total oil equivalent production), including 59,139 Bbl of oil  \nper day (98% of total oil production) and 246.0 MMcf of natural gas per day (90% of total natural gas production), in \n2022. We expect our Delaware Basin production to increase in 2024 as we continue the delineation and development \nof these asset areas.\nDuring 2023, we achieved all five significant and important operational milestones in the Delaware Basin we set \nat the beginning of the year. \nThese five operational milestones (as further described below in \u201c\u2014Exploration and \nProduction Segment\u2014Southeast New Mexico and West Texas\u2014Delaware Basin\u201d) were each achieved when we \nturned to sales:\n\u2022\t eight Rodney Robinson wells in the first half of 2023;\n\u2022\t eight Stateline wells in the first half of 2023;\n\u2022\t 21 Ranger wells on properties acquired in the Advance Acquisition in the second half of 2023, which was the \nlargest single batch development project in our history;\n\u2022\t 17 Stebbins wells in the second half of 2023; and\n\u2022\t 13 Wolf wells in the second half of 2023, including our first two \u201cU-Turn\u201d two-mile lateral wells.\nIn addition to achieving these five key operational milestones, other operational highlights in the Delaware Basin \n(as further described below in \u201c\u2014Exploration and Production Segment\u2014Southeast New Mexico and West Texas\u2014\nDelaware Basin\u201d) in 2023 included:\n\u2022\t continued drilling of longer laterals, with average completed lateral length for operated wells turned to sales \nin 2023 of approximately 9,800 feet; and\n\u2022\t capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping wells (\u201cD/C/E capital expenditures\u201d) for 2023  \nof $1.16 billion, which was below our estimated range for 2023 D/C/E capital expenditures of $1.18 to \n$1.32 billion as provided on February 21, 2023, and was in the middle of the revised estimated range of \n$1.10 to $1.22 billion, as provided on July 25, 2023.\nCapital Resources and Financing Highlights\nDuring 2023, we achieved several significant and important capital resources objectives, which included:\n\u2022\t the generation of free cash flow in all four quarters of 2023;\n\u2022\t the amendment of our dividend policy in the fourth quarter of 2023, pursuant to which we increased the \nquarterly cash dividend from $0.15 per share of common stock to $0.20 per share of common stock; and\n\u2022\t the receipt of $38.2 million in performance incentives directly from Five Point.\n\n\n8\t \t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \nFORM 10-K PART I\nDuring 2023, Pronto closed new natural gas gathering and processing transactions with counterparties in Eddy \nand Lea Counties, New Mexico, which are expected to generate additional natural gas gathering and processing \nvolumes in future periods. At December 31, 2023, Pronto\u2019s midstream system included a cryogenic natural gas \nprocessing plant with a designed inlet processing capacity of 60 MMcf per day (the \u201cMarlan Processing Plant\u201d), \nthree compressor stations and approximately 70 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in Eddy and Lea Counties, \nNew Mexico, spanning from the northeastern portion of the Arrowhead asset area into the Ranger asset area. \nPronto has also contracted to construct an additional natural gas processing plant with a designed inlet processing \ncapacity of 200 MMcf per day, including a nitrogen rejection unit and additional related facilities to be located near \nthe Marlan Processing Plant.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Initiatives\nWe are committed to creating long-term value in a responsible manner. Our aim is to reliably and profitably \nprovide the energy that society needs in a manner that is safe, protects the environment and is consistent with the \nindustry\u2019s best practices and highest applicable regulatory and legal standards. More recently, we have begun \nformally reporting on our stewardship efforts in our annual Sustainability Report using quantitative metrics aligned \nwith standards developed by an industry leader, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\nHighlights from our ESG initiatives, which generally relate to our operations in 2022 except as otherwise \nnoted, include:\n\u2022\t decreased direct greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 44% in 2022, as compared to 2019;\n\u2022\t decreased methane emissions intensity by 61% in 2022, as compared to 2019;\n\u2022\t decreased flaring intensity by 84% in 2022, as compared to 2019;\n\u2022\t increased use of non-fresh water to 99% of total water consumption in 2022;\n\u2022\t increased number of wells utilizing recycled produced water to 72% of total wells completed in 2022, as \ncompared to 16% in 2019;\n\u2022\t transported 98% of operated produced water and 94% of operated produced oil by pipeline in 2023; and\n\u2022\t provided approximately 22,000 hours of employee continuing education, equating to approximately 59 hours \nper employee in 2023.\nThese sustainability metrics have been calculated using the best information available to us. \nThe data utilized in \ncalculating such metrics is subject to certain reporting rules, regulatory reviews, definitions, calculation methodologies, \nestimates, adjustments and other factors. We expect to complete the review of fiscal year 2023 data from our ESG \ninitiatives in the second half of 2024 in connection with the preparation of our 2023 Sustainability Report.\nEXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION SEGMENT\nOur current operations are focused primarily on the oil and liquids-rich portion of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring \nplays in the Delaware Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We also operate in the Eagle Ford shale play in \nSouth \nTexas and the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley plays in Northwest Louisiana. During 2023, we devoted \nmost of our efforts and most of our capital expenditures to our drilling and completion operations and midstream \noperations in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin. Since our inception, our exploration  \nand development efforts have concentrated primarily on known hydrocarbon-producing basins with well-established \nproduction histories offering the potential for multiple-zone completions.\n\n\n10\t\n\t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \nFORM 10-K PART I\nSoutheast New Mexico and West Texas \u2014 Delaware Basin\nThe greater Permian Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas is a mature exploration and production \nregion with extensive developments in a wide variety of petroleum systems resulting in stacked target horizons in \nmany areas. Historically, the majority of development in this basin had focused on relatively conventional reservoir \ntargets, but the combination of advanced formation evaluation, 3-D seismic technology, horizontal drilling and \nhydraulic fracturing technology has enhanced the development potential of this basin, particularly in the organic rich \nshales, or source rocks, of the Wolfcamp formation and in the low permeability sand and carbonate reservoirs of \nthe Bone Spring, Brushy Canyon and Avalon formations.\nIn the western part of the Permian Basin, also known as the Delaware Basin, there are multiple horizontal targets \nin a given area that exist within the several thousand feet of hydrocarbon bearing layers that make up the Bone \nSpring and Wolfcamp plays. Multiple horizontal drilling and completion targets are being identified and targeted by \ncompanies, including us, throughout the vertical section, including the Brushy Canyon, Avalon and Bone Spring \n(First, Second and Third Sand and Carbonate) and several intervals within the Wolfcamp shale, often identified as \nWolfcamp A through D.\nAt December 31, 2023, our total acreage position in Southeast New Mexico and West \nTexas was approximately \n265,600 gross (152,200 net) acres, primarily in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving and Ward Counties, \nTexas. \nThese acreage totals included approximately 62,500 gross (36,200 net) acres in our Ranger asset area in  \nLea County, 58,000 gross (23,300 net) acres in our Arrowhead asset area in Eddy County, 45,700 gross (26,100 net) \nacres in our Rustler Breaks asset area in Eddy County, 31,900 gross (21,100 net) acres in our Antelope Ridge asset \narea in Lea County, 2,900 gross (2,900 net) acres in our Stateline asset area in Eddy County, 42,900 gross (27,100 net) \nacres in our Twin Lakes asset area in Lea County and 21,200 gross (15,000 net) acres in our Wolf, Jackson \nTrust and \nQuito asset areas in Loving and Ward County (collectively \u201cWest Texas\u201d) at December 31, 2023. We consider  \nthe vast majority of our Delaware Basin acreage position to be prospective for oil and liquids-rich targets in the Bone \nSpring and Wolfcamp formations. Other potential targets on certain portions of our acreage include the Brushy \nCanyon and Avalon formations, as well as the Abo, Strawn, Devonian, Penn Shale, Atoka, \nYeso and Morrow formations. \nAt December 31, 2023, our acreage position in the Delaware Basin was approximately 78% held by existing \nproduction. Excluding the undeveloped acreage acquired in the Bureau of Land Management New Mexico Oil and \nGas Lease Sale on September 5 and 6, 2018 (the \u201cBLM Acquisition\u201d), which has 10-year leases with favorable \nlease-holding provisions, and the \nTwin Lakes asset area, our acreage position in the Delaware Basin was approximately \n96% held by existing production at December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued the delineation and development of our Delaware Basin \nacreage. We completed and began producing oil and natural gas from 222 gross (99.6 net) horizontal wells in the \nDelaware Basin, including 119 gross (94.0 net) operated horizontal wells and 103 gross (5.6 net) non-operated \nhorizontal wells, throughout our various asset areas. At December 31, 2023, we had tested a number of different \nproducing horizons at various locations across our acreage position, including the Brushy Canyon, two benches of \nthe Avalon, two benches of the First Bone Spring, the Second Bone Spring Carbonate, three benches of the \nSecond Bone Spring Sand, three benches of the \nThird Bone Spring Carbonate, two benches of the \nThird Bone Spring \nSand, four benches of the Wolfcamp A, including the X, \nY and Z sands and the more organic, lower section of the \nWolfcamp A, three benches of the Wolfcamp B, the Wolfcamp D, the Strawn and the Morrow.\n\n\n66\t\n\t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \nFORM 10-K PART I\ncoverage in the future. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the levels or types of insurance we would have \notherwise obtained prior to these market changes, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not cover certain \nhazards or all potential losses that are currently covered, and may be subject to large deductibles. Losses and \nliabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delays in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause our reserves and production are concentrated in a few core areas, problems with production in \nand markets for a particular area could have a material impact on our business.\nAlmost all of our current oil and natural gas production and our proved reserves are attributable to our properties \nin the Delaware Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and the \nHaynesville shale in Northwest Louisiana. In recent years, the Delaware Basin has become an area of increasing \nfocus for us, and approximately 96% of our total oil and natural gas production for 2023 was attributable to our \nproperties in the Delaware Basin. Since 2016, the vast majority of our capital expenditures have been allocated to \nthe Delaware Basin. We expect that substantially all of our capital expenditures in 2024 will continue to be in  \nthe Delaware Basin, with the exception of amounts allocated to limited operations and certain non-operated well \nopportunities in our South Texas and Haynesville shale positions.\nThe industry focus on the Delaware Basin may adversely impact our ability to gather, transport and process our  \noil and natural gas production due to significant competition for access to gathering systems, pipelines, processing \nand refinery facilities and oil, condensate and produced water trucking operations. Due to the concentration of  \nour operations, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from \nour wells in our operating areas caused by transportation capacity constraints or interruptions, curtailment of \nproduction, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural \ndisasters, adverse weather conditions or plant closures for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance. Due to our \nconcentration of properties in the Delaware Basin, we are also particularly exposed to any differential between \nbenchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive for our production. See \u201c\u2014Risks Related \nto our Financial Condition\u2014A change in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil  \nand natural gas and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial \ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u201d\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by weather conditions and events such as hurricanes, tropical \nstorms and inclement winter weather, resulting in delays in drilling and completions, damage to facilities and \nequipment and the inability to receive equipment or access personnel and products at affected job sites in a timely \nmanner. For example, in recent years, the Delaware Basin has experienced periods of severe winter weather  \nthat impacted many operators. In particular, weather conditions and freezing temperatures have resulted in shut-ins \nof producing wells, power outages, curtailments in trucking, delays in drilling and completion of wells and other \nproduction constraints. Certain areas of the Delaware Basin have also experienced periods of severe flooding that \nimpacted our operations as well as many other operators in the area, resulting in delays in drilling, completing  \nand initiating production on certain wells. As we continue to focus our operations on the Delaware Basin, we may \nincreasingly face these and other challenges posed by severe weather.\nDue to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of \nthe same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they \nmight have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. For example, our operations in \nthe Delaware Basin are subject to particular restrictions on drilling activities based on environmental sensitivities and \nrequirements and potash mining operations. Such delays, interruptions or restrictions could have a material adverse \neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n110\t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \nFORM 10-K PART II\nIn February 2023, April 2023 and July 2023, our Board declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per share of \ncommon stock. In October 2023, the Board amended our dividend policy to increase the quarterly dividend to  \n$0.20 per share of common stock and also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock. \nOn February 13, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock payable  \non March 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2024.\nWe expect that development of our Delaware Basin assets will be the primary focus of our operations and capital \nexpenditures in 2024. We began 2024 operating seven contracted drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin and added  \nan eighth operated drilling rig in the first quarter of 2024. We have built significant optionality into our drilling program, \nwhich should generally allow us to decrease or increase the number of rigs we operate as necessary based on \nchanging commodity prices and other factors. Our 2024 estimated capital expenditure budget consists of $1.10 to \n$1.30 billion for D/C/E capital expenditures and $200.0 to $250.0 million for midstream capital expenditures,  \nwhich reflects our proportionate share of San Mateo\u2019s estimated 2024 capital expenditures as well as the estimated \n2024 capital expenditures for other wholly-owned midstream projects, including projects completed by Pronto.  \nThe midstream capital expenditure budget includes 100% of the costs associated with the Marlan Processing Plant \nexpansion noted above, although, at February 20, 2024, we were continuing to evaluate potential partners in \nPronto that would share in these capital expenditures and strategic opportunities. Substantially all of these 2024 \nestimated capital expenditures are expected to be allocated to (i) the further delineation and development of our \nleasehold position, (ii) the construction, installation and maintenance of midstream assets and (iii) our participation in \ncertain non-operated well opportunities in the Delaware Basin, South Texas and the Haynesville shale. Our 2024 \nDelaware Basin operated drilling program is expected to focus on the continued development of our various asset \nareas throughout the Delaware Basin, with a continued emphasis on drilling and completing a high percentage of \nlonger horizontal wells, including 99% with anticipated completed lateral lengths of greater than one mile.\nAs we have done in recent years, we may divest portions of our non-core assets, particularly in the Eagle Ford shale \nin South \nTexas and the Haynesville shale in Northwest Louisiana, as well as consider monetizing other assets, \nsuch as certain midstream assets and mineral and royalty interests, as value-creating opportunities arise. In addition, \nduring 2024, we intend to continue evaluating the opportunistic acquisition of producing properties, acreage and \nmineral interests and midstream assets, principally in the Delaware Basin. \nThese monetizations, divestitures and \nexpenditures are opportunity-specific, and purchase price multiples and per-acre prices can vary significantly based \non the asset or prospect. As a result, it is difficult to estimate these 2024 monetizations, divestitures and capital \nexpenditures with any degree of certainty; therefore, we have not provided estimated proceeds related to \nmonetizations or divestitures or estimated capital expenditures related to acquiring producing properties, acreage \nand mineral interests and midstream assets for 2024.\nOur 2024 capital expenditures may be adjusted as business conditions warrant and the amount, timing and \nallocation of such expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. \nThe aggregate amount of capital we \nwill expend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions, the actual costs to drill, complete and place  \non production operated or non-operated wells, our drilling results, the actual costs and scope of our midstream \nactivities, the ability of our joint venture partners to meet their capital obligations, other opportunities that may \nbecome available to us and our ability to obtain capital. When oil or natural gas prices decline, or costs increase \nsignificantly, we have the flexibility to defer a significant portion of our capital expenditures until later periods to \nconserve cash or to focus on projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate \nnear-term cash flows. We routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in prices, \navailability of financing, drilling, completion and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory \napprovals, the availability of rigs, success or lack of success in our exploration and development activities, contractual \nobligations, drilling plans for properties we do not operate and other factors both within and outside our control.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What strategic advantages might Matador Resources gain from its acreage distribution and pipeline infrastructure in the Delaware Basin, as depicted in the map?", "response": "", "images": []}

Grant of Award.  American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) hereby grants to the employee named on page 1 of this Notice and Agreement \n(\u201cEmployee\u201d) as a separate incentive in connection with Employee\u2019s employment and not in lieu of any salary or other compensation for Employee\u2019s services, an \nAward of the number of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) of Stock of the Company set forth on page 1 of this Notice and Agreement, which RSUs are granted on the \nGrant Date, subject to all the terms and conditions in this Notice and Agreement and in the Plan.  Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of Stock at a \nfuture point in time. \n2.  Rights of Employee with Respect to the Restricted Stock Units. \n \n2.1  No Stockholder Rights. The RSUs granted pursuant to this Award do not and shall not entitle Employee to any rights of a stockholder of Stock, including \nvoting rights with respect to shares of Stock underlying RSUs prior to the Company\u2019s issuance of such shares pursuant to Section 2.3. The rights of Employee with \nrespect to the RSUs shall remain forfeitable at all times prior to the date on which such rights become vested and the restrictions with respect to the RSUs lapse.\n2.2 Additional Restricted Stock Units. As long as Employee holds RSUs granted pursuant to this Award, the Company shall credit to Employee, on each date \nthat the Company pays a cash dividend to holders of Stock generally, an additional number of RSUs (\u201cAdditional RSUs\u201d) equal to the total number of whole RSUs \nand Additional RSUs previously credited to Employee under this Award multiplied by the dollar amount of the cash dividend paid per share of Stock by the \nCompany on such pay date, divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on such pay date.  Any fractional RSU resulting from such calculation shall be \nincluded in the Additional RSUs. A report showing the number of Additional RSUs so credited shall be sent to Employee periodically, as determined by the \nCompany. The Additional RSUs so credited shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the RSUs to which such Additional RSUs relate and the Additional \nRSUs shall be forfeited in the event that the RSUs with respect to which such Additional RSUs were credited are forfeited. \n\u00a0\n  2.3 Conversion of Restricted Stock Units; Issuance of Stock. No shares of Stock shall be issued to Employee prior to the date on which the RSUs vest, and the \nrestrictions with respect to the RSUs lapse, as set forth on page 1 of this Notice and Agreement. Neither this Section 2.3 nor any action taken pursuant to or in \naccordance with this Section 2.3 shall be construed to create a trust of any kind. After any RSUs vest as set forth on page 1 of this Notice and Agreement, the \nCompany shall as soon as administratively practicable (but no later than 30 days thereafter) cause to be issued one share of Stock for each RSU in book-entry form, \nregistered in Employee\u2019s name or in the name of Employee\u2019s legal representatives, beneficiaries or heirs, as the case may be, in payment of such vested whole RSUs \nand any Additional RSUs. The value of any fractional RSU shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share at the time shares are delivered to Employee in payment of \nthe RSUs and any Additional RSUs.\n3.  Termination of Service/Change in Control.  The RSUs as to which restrictions have not lapsed upon the date and time of Employee\u2019s termination of Service, \nfor a reason other than Employee\u2019s death, Disability or Retirement or following a Change in Control as specified in Section 9 of the Plan, shall terminate and \nthereupon revert to the Company automatically and without charge to the Company. Such RSUs shall thereafter be available for grant under the Plan.  In the event of \na termination of Service as a result of Employee\u2019s death, Disability or Retirement, or following a Change in Control as specified in Section 9 of the Plan, the Shares \nshall be vested in full as scheduled subject to proration based on the number of days of Employee\u2019s full time employment during the three year vesting period.  For \npurposes of clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change in Control, the provisions of Section 9 of the Plan shall control the vesting of the \nAward.\n\u00a0\n4.  Continuous Employment Required.  Subject to the provisions of Section 3 above, restrictions on RSUs shall not lapse and the RSUs shall not vest in \naccordance with any of the provisions of this Notice and Agreement unless Employee shall have been continuously employed by the Company or by one of its \naffiliates from the date of the Award until the date such restrictions are deemed to have lapsed. \n\u00a0\n5.  Forfeiture of Award.  Notwithstanding anything in this Notice and Agreement to the contrary, the RSUs represented by this Award may be forfeited in \naccordance with the provisions of Sections 3, 8 or 18 of this Notice and Agreement or Section 10 of the Plan.\n\u00a0\n2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Who signed the Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units Award Agreement on behalf of American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/77e34d64614f60c0a2818036ae22f3c2.png", "data/qwen_images/2e103fefd674caa6643b481e177f3fa2.png"]}

{"query": "<image><image><image>Context:\n\nInnovation \n \nHas a Name\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOur operations, including the manufact\nf\nur\nt\ne, packaging, labe\na\nling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our produc\nd\nts, are\nsubj\nu ect to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. In the U.S., many of our products are regulated by the\nDepartment of Energy, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission. State and local\ngovernments, through laws, regulations, and building codes, also regulate our water heating and water treatment produc\nd\nts.\nWhether at the federal, state, or local level, these laws are intended to improve energy effi\nf ciency and product safety, and\nprotect public health and the environment. In recent years, a number of states and local authorities have proposed or\nimplemented bans on gas-fired products in new construc\nr\ntion in an effo\nf\nrt to address greenhouse gas emissions. Similar laws\nand regulations have been adopted by government authorities in other countries in which we manufact\nf\nur\nt\ne, distribute, and sell\nour products. We offe\nf r a complete line of water and hydronic heating products, including electric-powered water heaters and\nboilers, and we believe that any reduction in fossil fuel-powered products would be counterba\nr\nlanced by a corresponding\nincrease in demand for our non-fossil fuel powered products. We are confid\nf ent that our continued emphasis on product\ndesign and innovation will keep us well positioned to deliver products demanded by customers, regardless of fuel source.\nIn addition, our operations are subj\nu ect to federal, state and local environmental laws. We are subj\nu ect to regulations of the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Occupa\nu\ntional Health and Safety Administration and their counterpa\nr\nrt state\nagencies. Compliance with government regulations and environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a\nmaterial effe\nf ct upon the capi\na tal expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of our company.

The information contained on our website is not included as a\npart of,\nf or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

All reports we file with the SEC are also availabl\na e free of charge via\nEDGAR through the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov.\nWe are committed to sound corporate governance and have documented our corporate governance practices by adopting the\nA. O. Smith Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance Guidelines, Criteria for Selection of Directors,\nFinancial Code of Ethics, the A. O. Smith Guiding Principles, as well as the charters for the Audit, Personnel and\nCompensation, Nominating and Governance and the Investment Policy Committees of the Board of Directors and other\ncorporate governance materials, may be viewed on the Company\u2019s website. Any waiver of or amendments to the Financial\nCode of Conduct or the A. O. Smith Guiding Principles would be posted on this website; to date there have been none.\nCopies of these documents will be sent to stockholders free of charge upon written request of the corporate secretary\nr\nat the\naddress shown on the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are also committed to growing our business in a sustainabl\na e and socially responsible manner consistent with our Guiding\nPrinciples. This commitment has driven us to design, engineer and manufact\nf\nur\nt\ne highly innovative and effi\nf cient products in an\nenvironmentally responsible manner that helps reduce energy consumption, conserve water and improve drinking water\nquality and public health. Consistent with this commitment, we issue our sustainabi\na lity report biennially detailing our\ncompany\u2019s historic and current effo\nf\nrts. We issued our third report, the 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\")\nReport in December 2022, documenting our ESG activities over the past two years. This report details the positive impact of\nour highly effi\nf cient products, highlights our company\u2019s commitment to employees and the communities in which we operate,\nand reports on our progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal of 10 percent by 2025. We have made\nsignificant progress toward our ESG emission reduction goal and prevented almost 500,000 metric tons of carbon\nr\nemissions\nin 2021 through the sale of our high effi\nf ciency water heaters and boilers. Our scorecard reflecting our progress is availabl\na e on\nour website. Our scorecard also provides information on our employee diversity, product stewardship, and recordabl\na e\nincident rate, among other items. We have also achieved WAVE water stewardship verification and achieved our fourth\nconsecutive Energy Star Partner of the Year Award. Our ESG report and ESG scorecard are availabl\na e on our website and not\nincluded as part of,\nf or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n6\n\n\nA. O.

O. SMITH CORPORAT\nR\nION\n2024 EPS Guidance and 2023 Adju\nd\nsted EPS\n(unaudited)\nThe following is a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adju\nd sted EPS (non-GAAP) (all items are net of tax):\n2024\nGuidance\n2023\nDiluted EPS (GAAP)\n$\n3.90 - 4.15 $\n3.69\nRestructur\nt\ning and impairment expenses\n\u2014\n0.12\n(1)\nAdju\nd\nsted EPS (non-GAAP)\n$\n3.90 - 4.15 $\n3.81\n(1) Includes pre-tax restructur\nt\ning and impairment expenses of $15.7 million and $3.1 million, within the Rest of World\nsegment and Corporate expenses, respectively.\nOutlook\nAs we begin 2024, we expect our consolidated sales to increase between three and five percent. Our sales projection is driven\nby continued end-market demand in water heating and a rebound in boiler and water treatment volumes afte\nf r 2023\ncorrections in end-market inventories. In our Rest of the World segment, we see overall growth with stability in China as the\neconomy continues to work through its challenges. We expect to achieve full-year earnings of between $3.90 and $4.15 per\nshare. Our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are governed by a number of federal, foreign, state, local and environmental laws concerning the generation\nand management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by\nthe Company or third parties. We have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures\nrelated to environmental matters were not material in 2023 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year. We\nhave reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with\navailabl\na e insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonabl\na y anticipated remediation costs. Although we believe that our\noperations are subs\nu\ntantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedur\nd\nes designed to maintain compliance, there\nare no assurances that subs\nu\ntantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However, since the same\nlaws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nRisk Management\nWe evaluate risk to our business in a number of ways, primarily through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process,\nwhich we conduct enterprise-wise on a periodic basis, and seeks to identify\nf\nand address significant and material risks. Our\nERM process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the Enterprise\ni\nRisk\ni\nManagement-Integr\ne\nated Framework\nr\n(2017) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO). We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. Our goal is to manage\nrisks prude\nr\nntly rather than avoid risks.

Smith Corporation\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria establ\na ished in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, A. O. Smith Corporation (the Company)\nmaintained, in all material respects, effe\nf ctive internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the\nCOSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Publ\nu ic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our\nreport dated Februa\nr\nry 13, 2024 expressed an unqualifie\nf d opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effe\nf ctive internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effe\nf ctiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report\non Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonabl\na e assurance about whether effe\nf ctive internal control over financial reporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effe\nf ctiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\nand performing such other procedur\nd\nes as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonabl\na e basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonabl\na e assurance regarding the\nreliabi\na lity of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purpos\nr\nes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedur\nd\nes\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonabl\na e detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonabl\na e assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effe\nf ct on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effe\nf ctiveness to future periods are subj\nu ect to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedur\nd\nes may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nFebrua\nr\nry 13, 2024\n60\n\n\n11270 West Park Place\nP.O.

{"query": "<image><image><image><image><image><image><image><image><image>Context:\n\n30\nmay also impact demand levels. Potential changes in global climate may produce, among other possible conditions, \nunusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in unusual weather conditions, more intense, \nfrequent and extreme weather events and other natural disasters. Some climatologists believe that these extreme \nweather events will become more common and more extreme, which will have a greater impact on our operations. \nNatural gas revenues typically increase in the first quarter due to increased heating demands and electricity revenues \ntypically increase in the third quarter due to increased air conditioning use. Approximately 48.1% and 39.7% of \nGRE\u2019s natural gas revenues for the relevant\u00a0years were generated in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, \nwhen demand for heating was highest. Although the demand for electricity is not as seasonal as natural gas (due, \nin part, to usage of electricity for both heating and cooling), approximately 32.5% and 30.5% of GRE\u2019s electricity \nrevenues for 2023 and 2022, respectively, were generated in the third quarters of those\u00a0years. GRE\u2019s REPs\u2019 revenues \nand operating income are subject to material seasonal variations, and the interim financial results are not necessarily \nindicative of the estimated financial results for the full year.\nIn addition to the direct physical impact that climate change may have on our business, financial condition and \nresults of operations because of the effect on pricing, demand for our offerings and/or the energy supple markets, \nwe may also be adversely impacted by other environmental factors, including: (i)\u00a0technological advances designed \nto promote energy efficiency and limit environmental impact; (ii)\u00a0increased competition from alternative energy \nsources; (iii)\u00a0regulatory responses aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions; and (iv)\u00a0litigation or regulatory \nactions that address the environmental impact of our energy products and services.\nPurchase of Receivable\nUtility companies offer purchase of receivable, or POR, programs in most of the service territories in which we \noperate. GRE\u2019s REPs reduce their customer credit risk by participating in POR programs for a majority of their \nreceivables. In addition to providing billing and collection services, utility companies purchase those REPs\u2019 \nreceivables and assume all credit risk without recourse to those REPs. GRE\u2019s REPs\u2019 primary credit risk is therefore \nnonpayment by the utility companies. In the year ended December\u00a031, 2023, the associated cost was approximately \n0.9% of GRE\u2019s revenue. At December\u00a031, 2023, 84.4% of GRE\u2019s net accounts receivable were under a POR program.\nConcentration of Customers and Associated Credit Risk\nGRE\u2019s REPs reduce their customer credit risk by participating in purchase of receivable programs for a majority \nof their receivables. In addition to providing billing and collection services, some utility companies purchase \nthose REPs\u2019 receivables and assume all credit risk without recourse to those REPs for those purchased receivables. \nGRE\u2019s REPs primary credit risk with respect to those purchased receivables is therefore nonpayment by the utility \ncompanies. Certain of the utility companies represent significant portions of our consolidated revenues and \nconsolidated gross trade accounts receivable balance during certain periods, and such concentrations increase our \nrisk associated with nonpayment by those utility companies.\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of consolidated trade receivable by customers that equal or exceed \n10.0% of consolidated net trade receivables at December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022 (no other single customer accounted for \n10.0% or greater of our consolidated net trade receivable as of December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022).\nDecember 31,\n2023\n2022\nCustomer A . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nna%\n10.2%\nna\u00a0\u2014\u00a0less than 10.0% of consolidated net trade receivables\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of consolidated revenues from customers that equal or exceed 10% \nor greater of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues in the period (no other single customer accounted for more than \n10% of consolidated revenues in these periods):\nYear ended December 31,\n2022\n2021\nCustomer A . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \nna%\n10.1%\nCustomer B . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n19.5\nna\nna\u00a0\u2014\u00a0less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues in the period\n\n\n34\nlikely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and \namounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a \nliability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset, \nor an increase in a deferred tax liability. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on \nour best estimate and judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To \nthe extent that the outcome of these tax positions is different from the amounts recorded, such differences may affect \nincome tax expense and actual tax payments.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note\u00a01 \u2014\u00a0Description of Business and \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual \nReport on Form\u00a010-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe evaluate the performance of our operating business segments based primarily on income (loss) from operations. \nAccordingly, the income and expense line items below income (loss) from operations are only included in our \ndiscussion of the consolidated results of operations.\nYear Ended December\u00a031, 2023 compared to Year Ended December\u00a031, 2022\nGenie Retail Energy Segment\nYear ended December 31,\nChange\n(amounts in thousands)\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\nRevenues:\nElectricity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n$ \n350,779\n$ \n241,828\n$ \n108,951\n45.1%\nNatural gas  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n55,988\n62,144\n(6,156)\n(9.9)\nOthers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n3,112\n\u2014\n3,112\nnm\nTotal revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n409,879\n303,972\n105,907\n34.8\nCost of revenues . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n266,519\n150,990\n115,529\n76.5\nGross profit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n143,360\n152,982\n(9,622)\n(6.3)\nSelling, general and administrative \n. . . . . . . \n71,449\n60,425\n11,024\n18.2\nIncome from operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n$ \n71,911\n$ \n92,557\n$ \n(20,646)\n(22.3)\nnm\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not meaningful\nRevenues. GRE\u2019s electricity revenues increased in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in electricity revenues in \n2023 compared to 2022 was the result of an increase in electricity consumption partially offset by a decrease in the \naverage price charged to customers. Electricity consumption by GRE\u2019s REPs\u2019 customers increased by 47.8% in 2023 \ncompared to 2022. The increase in electricity consumption reflected an increase in the average number of meters \nserved, which increased by 41.7% in 2023 compared to 2022 and a 4.3% increase in average electricity consumption \nper meter in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in meters served was driven by strong customer acquisitions \nduring 2023, while customer acquisition efforts had been reduced during 2022. Electricity consumption per meter \nincreased in 2023 due to warmer weather conditions in our service areas compared to 2022. The average rate per \nkilowatt hour sold decreased by 1.9% in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in the average rate per kilowatt hour \nsold is due to a decrease in the average wholesale price of electricity in 2023 compared to 2022.\nGRE\u2019\ns natural gas revenues decreased in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in natural gas revenues in 2023 compared \nto 2022 was a result of decreases in natural gas consumption and the average revenue per therm sold. Natural gas \nconsumption of GRE\u2019\ns REPs customers decreased by 0.4% in 2023 compared to 2022. Average consumption per meter \ndecreased by 6.6% in 2023 compared to 2022 while the average meters served increased by 6.6% in 2023 compared to \n2022. The average rate per therm sold decreased by 9.5% in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in the average revenue \nper therm sold is due to the decrease in the average wholesale price of natural gas in 2023 compared to 2022.\nOther revenues in 2023 included revenues from the sale of petroleum products in Israel.\n\n\n37\nRevenue. Genie Renewables\u2019 revenues increased in 2023 compared to 2022. The increases in revenues were the \nresult of increases in revenues from commissions from selling third-party products to customers by CityCom Solar \nand revenues from Diversegy that includes commissions, entry fees and other fees from our energy brokerage and \nmarketing services businesses.\nCost of Revenue. The variations in the cost of revenues in 2023 compared to 2022 are consistent with the variations \nin revenues of CityCom Solar and Diversegy. In 2023, we recorded a $1.1\u00a0million charge to the cost of revenues of \nGenie Solar to write down the carrying value of solar panel inventories to the estimated net realizable value.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2023 compared \nto 2022 primarily due to increases in headcount in Genie Solar and Diversegy and consulting fees and \nwarehousing costs at Genie Solar.\nCorporate\nAs discussed above, the remaining accounts of GRE International were transferred to corporate starting in the \nthird quarter of 2022. Entities under corporate do not generate any revenues, nor does it incur any cost of revenues. \nCorporate costs include unallocated compensation, consulting fees, legal fees, business development expense and \nother corporate-related general and administrative expenses.\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n(amounts in thousands)\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses . . . . . \n$ \n11,025\n$ \n9,209\n$ \n1,816\n19.7%\nProvision for captive insurance liability . . . \n45,088\n\u2014\n45,088\n100.0\nImpairment of assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n\u2014\n2,066\n(2,066)\n(100.0)\nLoss from operations \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n(56,113) $ \n(11,275) $ \n(44,838)\n397.7\nThe increase in Corporate general and administrative expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due \nincreases in employee related cost and stock-based compensation expenses. As a percentage of our consolidated \nrevenues, corporate general and administrative expenses slightly decreased from 2.9% in 2022 to 2.6% in 2023.\nIn December\u00a02023, we established a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the \u201cCaptive\u201d) with the primary \npurpose of enhancing our risk financing strategies. In December\u00a02023, we paid $51.2\u00a0million premiums to Captive, \nwhich amount is included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as of December\u00a031, 2023. The \nCaptive must maintain a sufficient level of cash to fund future reserve payment and secure the insurer\u2019s liabilities, \nparticularly those related to the insured risks. We also recognized a $45.1\u00a0million provision for captive insurance \nliability for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 related to Captive\u2019s exposure for the insured risks.\nIn December\u00a02022, the Company suspended the development of business operations of Petrocycle, Ltd. \n(\u201cPetrocycle\u201d), a pre-operating entity engaged in the development of a process to recycle used engine oil into \nusable gasoline, after it was determined that the current operations will not meet the expected results. Petrocycle \nprovided full impairment of its property and equipment and notes and other receivables from its minority interest \npartner for an aggregate amount of $2.1\u00a0million.\nConsolidated\nSelling, General and Administrative. Stock-based compensation expense included in consolidated selling, general \nand administrative expenses were $2.8\u00a0million and $3.0\u00a0million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December\u00a031, \n2023, aggregate unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation was $1.2\u00a0million. \nThe unrecognized compensation cost expected to be recognized over the average service period of 0.9\u00a0years.\nAs a percentage of our consolidated revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 23.8% in \n2022 to 21.3% in 2023.\n\n\nF-15\nGENIE ENERGY LTD. \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2014 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three\u00a0months or less when \npurchased to be cash equivalents.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in the \nconsolidated balance sheet that equals the total of the same amounts reported in the consolidated statement of cash \nflows:\nDecember 31,\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n107,609\n$ \n98,571\nRestricted cash \u2013 short-term . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n10,442\n6,007\nRestricted cash \u2013 long-term  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n44,945\n\u2014\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ \n162,996\n$ \n104,578\nRestricted cash\u00a0\u2014\u00a0short-term includes amounts set aside in accordance with the Amended and Restated Preferred \nSupplier Agreement with BP Energy Company (\u201cBP\u201d) (see Note\u00a016) and Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase \n(see Note\u00a010).\nRestricted cash\u00a0\u2014\u00a0long-term includes cash of a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the \u201cCaptive\u201d), which \nis restricted for use to secure the noncurrent portion of the insured liability program (see Note\u00a016).

By Theorem 102 there exists an extractor 2NMExt : [(n1, k1), (n2, k2) 7\u2192\nm \u223c\u03b51] such that:\n1. k1 \u226512 log(n2 \u2212k2) + 15\n2. n2 \u226530 log(n2) + 10 log(n1) + 20\n3. k2 \u2265(4\n5 + \u03b3)n2 + 3 log(n2) + log(n1) + 4\n4. \u03b51 \u22643 \u00b7 2\u22129\u03b3\n10 n2 + 40 \u00b7 \u03b5T where \u03b5T = 2\u2212\u2126(dc) with c < 1\n2\n5. m = \u2126(min{n2, k1})\nUsing Lemma 80, Tre : [(n1, k1), (m, m) 7\u2192\u2126(k1) \u223c\u03b52] is a strong seeded\nextractor with m = O(log2(n1) log(1/\u03b52)). Thus by Lemma 104 there exists a two\nsource non-malleable extractor 2NMExt\u2217: [(n1, k1), (n2, k2) 7\u2192\u2126(k1) \u223c\u03b51 + \u03b52].\nFurthermore, with n2 = o(n1) and k1, \u2113< n1\n2 , we get that 2NMExt\u2217has a rate\nof at most\nn1\n2(n1+n2) < 1\n2.\n4.10\nPrivacy Amplification against Memory Tam-\npering Active Adversaries.\nImagine Alice and Bob sharing some random but not uniform string W, they\nwould like to \"upgrade\" their random string W to uniformly random string. However\nEve is fully controlling a channel between Alice and Bob and can arbitrarily tamper\nwith the messages sent. The Privacy Amplification (PA) protocol guarantees that\neither Alice and Bob will end up with the same uniform string (unknown to Eve),\nor at least one of them will abort8.\nIn [11] the authors consider a stronger version of PA which they call a privacy\namplification resilient against memory-tampering active adversaries. In their model,\nAlice and Bob have access to a shared string W and their local sources of (not\nnecessarily uniform) randomness A and B respectively. At the beginning of the\nprotocol Eve can select one party, say Alice, and corrupt her memory F(W, A) =\n( \u02dc\nW, \u02dc\nA) (or F(W, B) = ( \u02dc\nW, \u02dc\nB) if Eve decides to corrupt Bob). If Eve did not corrupt\n8If one of the parties, say Alice, aborts but Bob generates random string RB then we require\nRB to be uniform and unknown to Eve.\n94\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. NON-MALLEABLE EXTRACTION, AND PRIVACY\nAMPLIFICATION\n\u2022\nIf Eve is passive: In this case, F is the identity function and Eve only\nwiretaps. Then, SA = SB \u0338= \u22a5with SA satisfying\nSA, C \u2248\u03b5 Um, C,\n(4.12)\nwhere C = (C1, C\u2032\n1, C2, C\u2032\n2, . . . , Cr, C\u2032\nr) denotes Eve\u2019s view.\n\u2022\nIf Eve is active: Then, with probability at least 1 \u2212\u03b4 either SA = \u22a5or\nSB = \u22a5(i.e., one of Alice and Bob detects tampering), or SA = SB \u0338= \u22a5with\nSA satisfying Equation 4.12.\nOne building block of our extension is MAC:\nDefinition 108. A family of functions MAC : {0, 1}\u03b3 \u00d7 {0, 1}\u03c4 \u2192{0, 1}\u03b4, Verify :\n{0, 1}\u03b3 \u00d7 {0, 1}\u03b4 \u00d7 {0, 1}\u03c4 \u2192{0, 1} is said to be a \u00b5\u2212secure one time message\nauthentication code if\n1. For ka \u2208R {0, 1}\u03c4, \u2200m \u2208{0, 1}\u03b3, Pr[Verify(m, MACka(m), ka) = 1] = 1,\nwhere for any (m, t), Verify(m, t, ka) :=\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1 if MAC(m, ka) = t\n0 otherwise\n2. For any m \u0338= m\u2032, t, t\u2032, Pr\nka [MAC(m, ka) = t|MAC(m\u2032, ka) = t\u2032] \u2264\u00b5, where ka \u2208R\n{0, 1}\u03c4.\nLemma 109. [116, 72] For any \u03b3, \u03b5 > 0 there is an efficient \u03b5\u2212secure one time\nMAC with \u03b4 \u2264(log(\u03b3) + log(1\n\u03b5)), \u03c4 \u22642\u03b4, where \u03c4, \u03b3, \u03b4 are key, message, tag length\nrespectively.\nIn the [11] protocol Alice and Bob exchange the random strings A and B and\nthen locally compute R = 2NMExt(A \u25e6B, W). They then split R into 3 parts,\nAlice sends the first part to Bob to prove she has gotten the right output, Bob then\nsends the second part to Alice to do the same. If this phase was successful then last\npart of R is the shared uniform string. Figure 4.1 illustrates the protocol.\nSince one of the sources of randomness might be faulty, even if the original\nA, B were uniform, one requires a left-strong non-malleable extractor 2NMExt to\nremain secure for the first source with entropy below 0.5, the construction of such\nan extractor prior to this work was unknown9.\n9Authors of [11] proceed to construct a computational non-malleable extractors with parameters\nthat would allow for this protocol to go through.\n96\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Privacy amplification protocol against memory-\ntampering active adversaries. In the above, for an n-bit string x we define [x]i =\n(x1, x2, . . . , xi), [x]i:j = (xi+1, . . . , xj), and [x]j: = (xj+1, . . . , xn).\nThe above protocol obtains very short output compared to entropy of W, whereas\nideally we would like to obtain something close to entropy of W. If Alice and Bob\nhave access to uniform randomness, one can extend this protocol to output almost as\nmany bits as W\u2019s entropy (see Figure 4.2). After the execution of the [11] protocol\nwe have the additional guarantee (see proof of Theorem 6, point (b)) that if SA \u0338= \u22a5\nand SB \u0338= \u22a5then we know that SA = SB and are close to uniform and moreover\nEve did not tamper with W of either of the parties (this is only achieved with\nstandard notion of non-malleability, not the one from [105]). If Alice and Bob have\naccess to some extra uniform bits (if A and B were uniform to start with then we\ncould cut them in half A = A1 \u25e6A2 and B = B1 \u25e6B2, use the first half to run the\noriginal protocol by [11] and save the other half for later) then we can continue the\nprotocol (in the spirit of [79]): Alice will send A2, \u03c3A to Bob, where \u03c3A is a Message\nAutentication Code of A2 with first half of SA as a key. Bob will do the same: send\nB2, \u03c3B to Alice using other half of SB as a MAC key. There is a one final problem,\nwe know that one of A2 or B2 is uniform but we don\u2019t know which (Eve could have\nleft W unchanged but could have tampered with random coins A and B), moreover\none of them might depend on W. Notice that A2 and B2 will remain independent,\nand one of them is independent of W and uniform. Therefore A2 + B2 is uniform\nand independent of W. Now all we have to do is plug in W and A2 + B2 into seeded\nextractor SExt(W, A2 + B2) and we can extract almost whole entropy out of W\n(and the output remains hidden from the view of Eve).\n97\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.

When party Aborts it stops responding and the\nfinal output is \u22a5.\nLet us analyse the protocol described in Figure 4.2 (we copy the figure below).\nLet 2NMExt be a [(\u21131, k1 \u22122\u21132 \u22122\u03b3 \u22121), (2 \u00b7 \u21132, \u21132 \u2212\u03b3 \u22121) 7\u21924\u03b1 \u223c\u03f5] strong\nnon-malleable extractor for some parameter \u03b3 > 0. Let shared secret W \u2208{0, 1}\u21131\nhave min-entropy k1, let A1, A2, B1, B2 \u2208{0, 1}\u21132 be uniform random variables. If\nEve is passive the security is straight forward thus we will only consider the case of\nactive Eve. We will follow the original proof [11] very closely. Let us focus on the\ncase where Alice is the one with corrupted memory F(W, (A1, A2)) = \u02dc\nW, ( \u02dc\nA1, \u02dc\nA2).\nSince randomness ( \u02dc\nA1, \u02dc\nA2) is controlled by the adversary we can simply reveal\n(\u02dc\na1, \u02dc\na2) = ( \u02dc\nA1, \u02dc\nA2) it along with original randomness (a1, a2) = (A1, A2), this makes\n\u02dc\nW only a function of W, let\u2019s denote it as \u02dc\nW = f(W), moreover let us denote\nB\u2032\n1 = g(B1). We define L = {w : f(w) = w} and R = {b1 : g(b) = b}.\nIn the proof of Theorem 6 in [11] in point (2.b) authors prove that if\n98\n\n\nCHAPTER 4. NON-MALLEABLE EXTRACTION, AND PRIVACY\nAMPLIFICATION\nPr(W /\n\u2208L\u2228B1 /\n\u2208R\u2228a1 = \u02dc\na1) > 2\u2212\u03b3 then Pr(SB \u0338= \u22a5| W /\n\u2208L\u2228B1 /\n\u2208R) < \u03f5+2\u2212\u03b1,\nthus Bob will abort.\nThe only case left to analyse is the point (2.a) where W \u2208L \u2227B1 \u2208R \u2227a1 = \u02dc\na1.\nWe assume that Pr(W \u2208L \u2227B1 \u2208R \u2227a1 = \u02dc\na1) > 2\u2212\u03b3 (else this case happens with\nnegligible probability). Authors argue that W has enough entropy and thus RA\nis \u03f5 close to uniform. If [RA]\u2032\n\u03b1 = [RA]\u03b1 and [RB]\u2032\n\u03b1:2\u03b1 = [RB]\u03b1:2\u03b1, then S1\nA \u25e6S2\nA =\nS1\nB \u25e6S2\nB \u0338= \u22a5and S1\nA \u25e6S2\nA is \u03f5 close to uniform given Eve\u2019s view. Now we know that\nS1\nA\u25e6S2\nA = S1\nB\u25e6S2\nB \u0338= \u22a5and \u02dc\nW = W so we can follow with the analysis of the extension:\nFirst of all the \u02dc\nH\u221e(W|A1, A2, \u02dc\nA1, \u02dc\nA2, W \u2208L) > k1 \u22122\u21132 \u2212\u03b3 (where |Ai| = \u2113, and \u03b3\npenalty comes from probability of the event W \u2208L). Now notice that by the security\nof MAC either Pr((A2 \u0338= A\u2032\n2 \u2228B2 \u0338= B\u2032\n2) \u2227neither Alice or Bob Aborts) < 2 \u00b7 2\u2212\u2126(\u03b1).\nFurther observe that even if Eve controls A2, and A2 has no entropy and it\nmight depend on W, still B2 is uniform and independent of (A2). Thus A2 + B2 is\nuniform10 and independent of W. Now we have uniform independent seed, all we\nhave to do is extract:\nLet SExt : {0, 1}\u21131 \u00d7{0, 1}\u21132 \u2192{0, 1}0.999\u00b7(k1\u22122\u21132\u2212\u03b3) is a strong seeded extractor11\nwith the error 2\u2212\u2126(\u21132). Since W has enough entropy SExt(W, A2 + B2) is 2\u2212\u2126(\u21132)\nclose to uniform given the view of Eve. The analysis for Eve corrupting Bob is\nsymmetrical. Thus we obtain the following:\nTheorem 110. Let 2NMExt be a [(\u21131, k1\u22122\u21132\u22122\u03b3\u22121), (2\u00b7\u21132, \u21132\u2212\u03b3\u22121) 7\u21924\u03b1 \u223c\u03f5]\nstrong non-malleable extractor. Then, there exists an (r = 6, \u21131, k1, 2 \u00b7 \u21132, 2 \u00b7 \u21132, 0.999 \u00b7\n(k1 \u22122\u2113\u2212\u03b3), 2\u2212\u2126(\u21132), \u03b4 = \u03b5 + 2\u2212\u03b1 + 2 \u00b7 2\u2212\u03b3 + 2\u2212\u2126(\u03b1))-privacy amplification protocol\nagainst memory-tampering active adversaries.\nAnd thus when we plug in our extractor and some example parameters we get:\nCorollary 111. For shared secret W with |W| = n and H\u221e(W) > 0.803 \u00b7 n and\n|Ai| = |Bi| = 0.001n we get privacy amplification protocol that outputs 0.8\u00b7n uniform\nbits, and has a security 2\u2212\u2126(\u221an).\n10Technically speaking Eve can abort protocol by tampering with A2 or B2, Alice and Bob will\nsimply abort. However A2 and B2 are no longer fully uniform conditioned on the event that Eve\nlet them through. This is not a problem, by Lemma 73, this only doubles extraction epsilons.\n11Constant 0.999 is just a placeholder for any constant less then 1.

We generate revenues primarily by providing utility-\nrelated business, including advertising services and premium membership services worldwide. We also provide multi-cloud management \nand overseas advertising agency service. Multi-cloud management service is to provide our customers one-stop multi-cloud resource \nmanagement solutions, conduct comprehensive management of multi-cloud resources and environment, and provide various solutions \nthat can be implemented in the cloud, including platforms for backup and disaster recovery, machine learning, cost optimization and \nmonitoring alarm. Overseas advertising agency service is to assist companies to launch advertisement on large overseas advertising \nplatforms, such as Facebook.\nSubsequent to the acquisition of Beijing OrionStar, we enlarged our business to provide service robots globally to restaurants, \nsupermarkets, exhibitions and so on. Through a full range of AI technologies, our service robots can be customized and are able to \nprovide comprehensive solutions to optimize efficiency, improve sales, ensure service standardization and enhance customer \nsatisfaction. At the same time, we actively engage in the independent research and development of our AI technologies, including large \nlanguage model (\"LLM\") technologies to provides AI-powered business solutions for enterprise customers, enabling enterprises to apply \nLLM technology, digitalize employees and improve operational efficiency. Although our revenue generated by these business lines in \n2023 was immaterial, we expect these AI related businesses to have growth potential in the future. \nWe reported our revenues and operating profits in two segments: internet business and AI and others. In 2023, we acquired \ncontrolling stake of Beijing OrionStar, and reported the results of Beijing OrionStar in the AI and others segment.\nRevenues from our internet business mainly include two parts, online advertising and internet value-added services. We generate \nadvertising revenues by providing mobile advertising services to our customers worldwide, as well as selling advertisements and \nreferring user traffic on our mobile and PC platforms. We generate value-added services revenues principally from fee-based services, \nmainly including VIP membership, software subscription and game-related services.\nRevenues from our AI and other business mainly from multi-cloud management platform, overseas advertising agency service \nand sale and rental of service robots and some other AI related business.\nOn the corporate level, our revenues decreased to RMB669.5 million (US$94.3 million) in 2023 due to the revenue decrease of \nour online advertising and gaming services. Our net loss attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders was RMB602.9 million (US$84.9 \nmillion) in 2023, compared to a net loss attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders of RMB513.5 million in 2022.\nHistorically, we have invested heavily in research and development and selling and marketing to grow our businesses. Since 2021, \nwe have taken measures to control expenses and improve operational efficiency, such as organization downsizing. In 2023, we completed \nthe acquisition of Beijing OrionStar, our headcount increased from 713 as of December 31, 2022 to 845 as of December 31, 2023.\nSelected Statement of Operations Items\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues from internet business and AI and others.

Additionally, manual methods may struggle to consistently cap-\nture subtle nuances and complex patterns in retinal images, which are critical\nfor accurate diagnosis [60, 59]. To address these limitations, we propose lever-\naging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate parts of the traditional process.\nAI can quickly and accurately analyze vast amounts of image data, identify-\ning patterns and anomalies that humans may miss. Integrating AI into the\ntraditional diagnostic process aims to improve accuracy, reduce clinicians\u2019\nworkload, and enhance patient care.

To train and validate the effectiveness\nof our DNN-based module, we have developed a large-scale retinal disease\nimage dataset. Additionally, we provide a manually labeled retinal image\ndataset, annotated by ophthalmologists, to qualitatively demonstrate the ef-\nfectiveness of the proposed AI-based method.\nOur method is capable of\ncreating meaningful retinal image descriptions and visual explanations that\nare clinically relevant. The primary challenge lies in encoding and utilizing\nthe interactive information between text-based keywords and retinal images\n\n\n2.1.

Figure 1.2 demonstrates how\nthis AI-based method can enhance the traditional retinal disease treatment\nprocess.\nthy (DR) will soon affect over 500 million people globally [103]. The tradi-\ntional process of diagnosing retinal diseases and generating medical reports is\ntime-consuming, which implies that ophthalmologists will face an increasing\nworkload soon.\nThe current state of the art in AI focuses on deep learning, which holds\ngreat promise for assisting ophthalmologists and enhancing traditional reti-\nnal disease treatment procedures.\nDeep learning models, such as convo-\nlutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) for natural language processing, have achieved\u2014and some-\ntimes surpassed\u2014human-level performance. Therefore, it is an opportune\ntime to introduce AI-based medical diagnosis methods to support ophthal-\nmologists.\nIn Chapter 2, we propose an AI-based method for automatic medical\nreport generation from retinal images, as illustrated in Figure 2.1.\nThis\napproach aims to enhance the traditional retinal disease diagnosis process,\nshown in Figure 1.2, by increasing efficiency and accuracy for ophthalmol-\n\n\n2.6.

This method comprises a DNN-based module,\nwhich includes the RDI and CDG sub-modules, as well as a DNN visual\nexplanation module. To train our deep models and validate the effectiveness\nof the RDI and CDG, we introduce a large-scale retinal disease image dataset,\nDEN.

(e) When the last trace is\ncured, the device is fully functional; here, the quadcopter lifts directly off from the platform.\nIn the following sections we describe each of the four main components of this work.\nWe start by describing the hardware add-on that incorporates a silver dispenser and a pick-\nand-place mechanism. Next we explain the laser sintering technique. After this, we present\nour motion-based signaling technique and finally we illustrate an end-to-end design and\nfabrication workflow based on our design and visualization tool coupled with the translation\npipeline that converts the design into machine instructions.\n3.1\nHardware Add-on\nWe developed an add-on for a laser cutter that allows it to fabricate functional electrome-\nchanical devices. Our hardware add-on complements the laser cutter\u2019s native abilities to\ncreate the geometry of a device with circuit creation and assembly capabilities. We accom-\nplish this by adding a silver dispenser and a pick-and-place mechanism to the laser cutter\nhead (Figure 3.3).\nOur hardware add-on together with the laser cutter\u2019s native functionality creates func-\ntional devices in the following way: (1) To create the geometry, our system uses the regular\nlaser cutter head to cut 2D geometries and optionally bend them into 3D. (2) To add circuit\ntraces, our silver dispenser in the form of a syringe extrudes silver paste. It can create highly\nconductive circuit traces down to (3.2\u2126/m) sufficient for most electronic components. (3)\nTo assemble components, a pick-and-place mechanism consisting of a second syringe on the\nadd-on enables moving components inside the laser cutter. Components are picked from a\nstorage area within the laser cutter platform. Our add-on accommodates lifting components\nup to a mass of 65g and small SMD components down to size 2010. (4) Finally, we use laser\n40\n\n\npotential to work across different fabrication devices. Before motion-based signaling can\nbe used on a new machine, the motion-signal must first be characterized via the one-time\ncalibration and the add-on\u2019s physical clips need to be adjusted to the differently shaped tool\nhead.\n3.4\nDesigning a Device for Use with LaserFactory\nFigure 3.8: LaserFactory Pipeline: (a) Design Tool: Users place components, and draw\ngeometry and circuit traces. (b) Visualization Tool: Users can preview the design in 3D and\nvisualize the fabrication steps for debugging the design. (c) Post-Processing: On export,\nthe design file is converted into machine instructions for the augmented laser cutter. (d)\nFabrication: The augmented laser cutter then executes the post-processed file, i.e. cuts the\ngeometry, dispenses silver for circuit traces, pick-and-places components, and then cures the\nsilver to make the traces conductive and sinters the components. Once fabricated, the device\nis fully functional.\nTo support the creation of devices with LaserFactory, we provide the end-to-end fabri-\ncation pipeline shown in Figure 3.8. It consists of a design and visualization tool as well as\na post-processing script that converts the design file into a set of machine instructions for\nfabricating the device with LaserFactory on the augmented laser cutter. The design tool\nlets users create 2D designs using drawing tools for the geometry (\u2018cut\u2019, \u2018fold\u2019), the circuit\ntraces (\u2018wire\u2019), and for placing electronic components (\u2018place part\u2019). This allows users to\nconcurrently design the geometry and the electronic circuit. The accompanying visualiza-\ntion tool renders both the final 2D or 3D design and allows users to animate each step of\nthe fabrication process. This assists users who may find it difficult to visualize the abstract\n2D drawing. In addition, it allows users to inspect the order of each step in the fabrication\nprocess. On export, our post-processing script automatically translates the design file into\nmachine instructions. Users do not have to add any explicit instructions for the add-on.\n51\n\n\n3.4.1\nDesign Tool\nOur design tool (developed as a plugin to the 2D editor Adobe Illustrator) supports users\nin placing components, drawing circuit traces and designing the geometry of their devices.\nFigure 3.9a shows the toolbar of our design tool, which has the following functionality.\nFigure 3.9: Users use the design toolbar to design a device such as a quadcopter.\nThe\nsteps involved (a,e) placing components from a part library, (b,f) routing circuit traces, (c,g)\ndrawing lines for the geometry, here showing cut lines and (d,h) using export tools, here\nshowing rendering the output of the visualization tool.\nElectronic component library: To facilitate circuit design, users can select electronic com-\nponents from a library of parts. Common components can be accessed directly from the\ntoolbar and others can be found using the \u2019find part\u2019 button that opens the component li-\nbrary (Figure 3.9a). After selecting a component, it is loaded as a 2D representation onto\nthe canvas (Figure 3.9b). Components appear as their physical footprint superimposed with\ntheir electronic symbol. Seeing the electronic components allows users to appraise the size\nof the main geometry in their design and adjust the design as needed.\nWire drawing tool: LaserFactory offers a wire drawing tool (Figure 3.9b), which is used\nto connect electronic components with traces. While free-form traces are possible, we enforce\nthe wire tool to snap to 0/90\u00b0 in order to align signaling motion with trace geometry for\ncleaner fabrication. Traces can also snap to the electrodes of components on approach to\nthem, ensuring good electrical connections during fabrication. In the drawing, circuit traces\nare differentiated from other types of lines by color coding them in green (Figure 3.9g).\nGeometry drawing tools: The LaserFactory user interface offers two drawing tools to\ndefine the geometry of the object (Figure 3.9c): the cut drawing tool and the bend drawing\ntool. In the drawing, cut lines are visualized in red and bend lines are visualized in cyan.\nFor bending, users only have to indicate where to bend, but not in which order, which is\ntaken care of by our post-processing script. For bending, users must use the \u2019anchor\u2019 tool to\nassign a section as the anchor plane which constrains this section as the one that remains\nplanar in the event of folding.\nExport tools: Finally, the interface includes a set of tools for use on completion of the\n52\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Functional Devices made with LaserFactory: (a) a quadcopter that can lift\nof the fabrication platform, (b) a sensor-equipped wristband capable of gesture recognition,\nand (c) a printed circuit board, specifically an H bridge.\ncreated capacitive sensors from traces themselves, showing how simple touch and humidity\nsensors as well as antennae can be fabricated without the need to procure dedicated external\ncomponents.\n3.5.3\nPrinted circuit boards\nWe fabricated an H bridge motor driver as an individual PCB (Figure 3.11c). H bridges are\ncircuits used to switch the polarity of a load, allowing them to directly drive a DC motor\nbidirectionally. They are frequently used by hobbyists and electronic novices because micro-\ncontrollers, such as the Arduino platform, cannot drive motors directly from their pins. The\nH bridge takes 12 minutes to fabricate and is made up of 13 components: two PNP transis-\ntors, two NPN transistors, four resistors and five female header connectors. These connectors\nare used to easily mate with the four required control signals and a motor. This application\ndemonstrates LaserFactory\u2019s capability to create ICs from basic SMD components, such as\ntransistors and resistors. Since transistors and resistors can be used to create a variety of\ndifferent ICs with different functionality (e.g., H bridges, Op Amps), this example showcases\nthat LaserFactory can create a diverse set of devices even when only basic components are\nloaded into the component storage area. Thus, rather than ordering the ICs, LaserFactory\ncan make them on demand.

Accordingly,\nwe derive eleven MRs based on eleven perturbation methods, where\neach MR assumes that the classification label returned by the content\nmoderation software on the generated test case (i.e., perturbed text)\nshould be the same as that on the seed (i.e., original text). Table 5.1\npresents the eleven perturbation methods, their categories, examples\nin two languages, and the percentage of each in our study. We will\nintroduce the MRs (their corresponding perturbation methods) in the\nfollowing.\n5.2.2\nMRs with Character-Level Perturbations\nMR1-1 Visual-Based Substitution\nThis MR uses visual-based substitutions, which replace characters\nwith visually similar characters. These visually similar characters are\nnot required to be semantically equivalent or similar to the original\ncharacters. Usually, the candidates come from the alphabet of other\nlanguages. For example, users can replace \u201ca\u201d with \u201c\u00e5\u201d, \u201c\u00e4\u201d, \u201c\u0105\u201d, \u201c\u03b1\u201d,\netc. The candidates can also be punctuation or numbers, such as \u201c(\u201d\nfor \u201cC\u201d and \u201c1\u201d for \u201cl\u201d. For Chinese characters, we can consider their\nvariants from different language systems, such as Kanji in Japanese,\nHanja in Korean, and Han character in Vietnamese, making a Chinese\n\n\n84\nCHAPTER 5. SAFETY AGAINST PERTURBATION\ncharacter usually has up to three variants. Besides variants, we can\neasily find many characters that look highly similar. \u201c\u30ab\u201d (one of the\nJapanese kana) for \u201c\u529b\u201d (Power) and \u201c\u66f0\u201d (Say) for \u201c\u65e5\u201d (Sun) are\nexamples of such substitutions.\nMR1-2 Visual-Based Splitting\nThis MR employs visual-based splitting, which separates a char-\nacter into multiple parts.\nThis MR is inspired by the fact that\nmany characters are composed of other characters. Therefore, some\ncharacters can be separated into two characters, such as \u201cVV\u201d\nfor \u201cW\u201d and \u201c\u5973\u5b50\u201d (Woman) for \u201c\u597d\u201d (Good).\nSome Chinese\ncharacters can even be split into three characters, for example \u201c\u6728\n\u8eab\u5bf8\u201d (Wood/Body/Inch) for \u201c\u69ad\u201d (Pavilion).\nIt is worth noting\nthat Chinese characters can sometimes be split vertically, like \u201c\u4ea1\n\u5fc3\u201d (Die/Heart) for \u201c\u5fd8\u201d (Forget).\nMR1-3 Visual-Based Combination\nThis MR\u2019s perturbation method is the inverse transformation of\nMR1-2. Visual-based combination combines adjacent characters into\na single character, such as \u201cm\u201d for \u201crn\u201d. The difference between this\nMR and MR1-2 is that, in MR1-2, the underlying meaning is expressed\nby the combination of characters. Instead, in this MR, we understand\nthe meaning by splitting certain characters.\nMR1-4 Noise Injection\nThis MR perturbs text via noise injection, which inserts additional\ncharacters into the original text. To not affect human comprehension,\nusers tend to let the noise be closely related to the context (e.g., \u201co\u201d in\n\u201cHellooo\u201d) or from a different domain which can make users ignore the\nnoise when reading (e.g., \u201c*\u201d in \u201cH*ell*o\u201d). Specifically, \u201cHello\u201d has\nmultiple \u201co\u201ds, and \u201c*\u201d is a mathematical symbol outside the English\nalphabet. Therefore, humans can easily ignore the noises.\nMR1-5 Character Masking\nThis MR uses character masking, which masks a small portion\n\n\n88\nCHAPTER 5. SAFETY AGAINST PERTURBATION\nas software for user review analysis and machine translation.\n5.2.6\nImplementation Details\nIn this section, we describe the implementation details of MTTM.\nSpecifically, we implement (1) a target word selection approach and\n(2) the perturbations on the selected word in different MRs except\nMR3-1. For MR3-1, we conduct sentence-level perturbation without\nthe need to identify target words.\nTarget Word Selection. We intend to perturb the words important\nfor the content moderation scenario so that perturbations on these\nwords are more likely to affect the output of content moderation\nsoftware. Specifically, we focus on words frequently appearing in the\ntoxic content datasets but less frequently in a general domain corpus.\nThus, we use TF-IDF to select target words. We utilize sklearn9 for\nthe English corpus and Jieba library10 for the Chinese corpus. After\nfiltering out the stop words, we select the top 20 words with the highest\nTF-IDF score for each dataset.\nMR1-1 Visual-Based Substitution. For each English character in\nthe target words, we use DeepAI visual similarity API11 to find the\nmost visually similar character in the Greek and German alphabets\nas the candidate.\nFor each Chinese character in target words, we\nleverage SimilarCharacter12, a Python library that uses OpenCV13\nto calculate the visual similarity score within 3, 000 commonly used\nChinese characters, to find another word with the highest visual\nsimilarity score as the candidate. To ensure a high similarity, we only\nreplace the original character with the candidate if their similarity\nscore is higher than 0.7.\nMR1-2 Visual-Based Splitting.\nFor both languages, we use\nDeepAI visual similarity API to find the most visually similar bi-char\n9https://scikit-learn.org/\n10https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba\n11https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/image-similarity\n12https://github.com/contr4l/SimilarCharacter\n13https://opencv.org/\n\n\n5.2. METHODOLOGY\n89\ncombinations as the candidate. We only replace the original character\nwith the candidate if their similarity score is higher than 0.7. Due to\nthe large character space of Chinese characters, it is time-consuming\nto transverse all the bi-char combinations. Thus, we use the Chinese\nCharacter Dictionaries14 to split the character that is split-able in\ntarget words as the candidate.\nMR1-3 Visual-Based Combination.\nMR1-3 uses the splitting\nsubstitution (the original character, the candidate) dictionary built\nin MR1-2 (Visual-Based Splitting). For each target word, if any of\nits bi-char combinations occur in the dictionary, we substitute the\ncombined character for the bi-char combination.\nMR1-4 Noise Injection. We implement two character-level noise\ninjection methods:\ninsertion and repetition.\nFor insertion, we\nrandomly insert a character into the target word.\nAccording to\nthe definition in Section 5.2.2, we implement two types of insertion:\ninserting a character from the language\u2019s alphabet, which is closely\nrelated to the context, and inserting a unique punctuation character,\nwhich is from a different domain. For repetition, we repeat the vowel\nin each English target word and randomly repeat a character in each\nChinese target word.\nMR1-5 Character Masking. For each target word, we randomly\nreplace a character with \u201c*\u201d to mask the character. For English, we\nmask a vowel in the target word.\nMR1-6 Character Swap. For each target word, we randomly swap\ntwo adjacent characters. For Chinese, we randomly swap characters\nafter tokenization.\nMR2-1 Language Switch. For each target word in English (resp.\nChinese), we invoke Google Translate API15 to translate it into\nSpanish (resp.\nEnglish), which is the most widely used second\nlanguage in the USA (resp. China).\n14https://github.com/kfcd/chaizi\n15https://translate.google.com/\n\n\n5.3.

The results are presented in Table 5.5. We can observe that\nthe test case generated by MTTM can largely improve the robustness\nof the content moderation models in the sense that the EFRs have\nbeen significantly reduced (e.g., from 71.3% to 0.0% for the MR1-\n1 Visual-Based Substitution). In other words, after retraining with\nMTTM\u2019s test cases, the model is rarely fooled by all the perturbations.\nMoreover, the model\u2019s accuracy remains on par after robust training\n(from 91.5% to 91.2 %), which means the retraining did not affect\nmodel performance on the original test set.\nNotably, our approach will not introduce extra unknown tokens\nbecause:\n(1) BERT has a huge (\u223c\n30, 000 tokens) vocabulary\ngenerated from massive data on the web, including characters from\nvarious languages; (2) BERT uses byte-pair encoding, an encoding\ntechnique that can effectively mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem.\nFor example, the generated \u201chelllo\u201d will be tokenized into \u201chell\u201d and\n\u201clo\u201d instead of treating the whole word as an unknown token.\nWe do not conduct experiments on improving industrial models\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat is the key difference between the perturbation methods \"Visual-based Splitting\" and \"Visual-based Combination\" in terms of how they affect the understanding of the text's meaning?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/a80976d7cf43b79418d01c61f9b2f8b7.png", "data/qwen_images/64ea9571f34463ec2a5f2a0c13b0a536.png"]}

Advances in Online Controlled Experiments\n145\n5.4\nAdvances in Online Controlled Experiments\nHere, we provide a brief review of the advances in OCEs. Since its inception in the late\n1990s [153], the field has seen tremendous growth in research output and its economic and\nsocietal impact [263]. More recently, we have also seen some comprehensive and up-to-date\nreviews in the area:\n\u2022 [155] provided a narrative, general-purpose guide to the field while collating many rele-\nvant works.14\n\u2022 [12] and [225] provided systematic literature reviews. The former built a taxonomy based\non the process-infrastructure distinction, type of methodological approach, and the chal-\nlenges/benefits involved. The latter categorised the works by the subject of an experi-\nment,15 choices made in the experiment design/execution processes, and the role of stake-\nholders.\n\u2022 [116] and [159] described the challenges. The former provided a general view by including\ndata, engineering, and organisational culture topics. The latter focused on the statistical\naspect and provided a more technical treatment to each topic presented.\nThis review aims to be a gateway to the multitude of research works in the area by unifying\nthe many nomenclatures, providing a concise problem statement for each challenge, and\nsuggesting works accessible to those new to a particular line of work. For a fuller exposition of\nthe challenges and research in this area, readers should refer to the five high-quality reviews\nlisted above.\nMost of the section is dedicated to advanced statistical methods, building on concepts and\nnotations covered in Chapter 3 (on statistical testing) and Sections 5.2 and 5.3.1 (on the po-\ntential outcomes framework). We will also briefly outline works addressing other topics in\nrunning successful OCEs, as mentioned in the second research question in Section 1.2. These\ninclude choosing decision metrics / evaluation criteria, scalable computer systems, and fos-\ntering a growth mindset organisational culture.\n14\nThe author reviewed part of the manuscript before the book\u2019s publication in 2020.\n15\nDefined in [225] as the application domain and the element subjected to experimental manipulation.\n\n\n152\nChapter 5. Recent Advances in Digital Experimentation Methods\nAnatomy of an OCE\nA mature OCE system/platform often features complex processes\nand infrastructure, and many seek to provide an overview or describe specific parts of the\necosystem. [154] provided a definitive guide on setting up, running, reporting, and scaling\nOCEs. Several papers described the scalable, concurrent testing infrastructure and its asso-\nciated challenges at major technology companies [149, 260, 288]. Others described the OCE\nlifecycle [91] and characterised the elements defining an experiment [11].\nState and progress of OCEs\u2019 usage\nA class of works aim to capture the state and track the\nprogress of the use of OCEs (or DEM capabilities in general) across many organisations.\nSome propose models that represent the maturity/growth of DEM capabilities [92, 280].\nOthers focus on experiment outcomes and perform meta-analyses on results from multiple\nOCEs \u2013 see [29, 30, 136] for results across industries, in e-commerce, and in display adver-\ntising, respectively. [103] bridged the two topics above by linking experiment performance\nto organisational structure.\nPitfalls in OCE operations\nDespite the increasing adoption and maturity of the use of\nOCE, running a successful OCE after another is, by the admission of the biggest players\nin the industry, difficult [155]. This is due to many non-obvious challenges and pitfalls ex-\nperimenters face while running an OCE end-to-end. In addition to that related to statistical\ntesting (see Chapter 3) and requiring advanced statistical methods (see Section 5.4.1), many\naccounts [53, 74, 89, 152, 148] describe pitfalls related to experimentation infrastructure, de-\ncision metric selection and interpretation [68], and external effects [126]. We summarise\nthese challenges and pitfalls in Table 5.1. To mitigate the potential problems, [179] proposed\ntechniques that separate problematic user responses affected by some of the external effects\n(namely dilution, carry-over effect, and novelty effect) from valid ones. [41, 93] also devel-\noped a series of diagnostic tests to identify the root cause(s) of a sample ratio mismatch, a\ncommon symptom for tests that are potentially invalidated due to encountering one or more\nof the pitfalls (see \u201cpractical usage\u201d paragraph of Section 3.7.2).\n\n\n5.4.

U.S. revenues decreased by 13% to $4.96 billion \ncompared with 2022. International revenues decreased by 6% to $1.44 \nbillion compared with 2022 and accounted for 22% of the total revenue for \nthe Company in 2023.\nNet income was $411 million, or $3.88 per share, compared with net \nincome of $658 million, or $6.03 per share, in 2022. \nCash flow from operations for the year was $637 million, down 7% from \n$684 million in 2022. In 2023, we distributed $1.92 per share in cash \ndividends to our shareholders for a total cash outlay of $206 million. We \nalso repurchased approximately 3 million Robert Half shares during the \nyear for $232 million. Return on invested capital was 26% for the year. \nOur 2023 talent solutions revenues decreased by 15% to $4.46 billion \n\u2014 permanent placement revenue was down 22%, while contract talent \nsolutions revenue was down 14%.\nProtiviti revenues for 2023 were $1.93 billion, down 3% compared with \n2022. Protiviti contributed 30% of the Company\u2019s revenue and 34% of the \nCompany\u2019s combined segment income for the year. Protiviti continues to \ncompete very effectively in the marketplace, benefiting from its focused \nand nimble solutions offerings and its differentiated mix of professional \nresources, including priority access to scalable contract talent at all skill \nlevels sourced through our talent solutions practices.\nIn 2023, ongoing economic uncertainty impacted client and candidate confidence \nlevels, which lengthened their decision time frames and elongated our sales cycles. \nWhile labor demand remained resilient and talent shortages persisted, hiring activity \nand new project starts were impacted across the globe. We navigated these complex \nconditions to address the critical talent needs of our clients by combining the power of \nour advanced, artificial intelligence-based technologies with the unique expertise of our \nspecialized talent solutions professionals. \nOur business consulting subsidiary, Protiviti, was less impacted economically due to \nits diversified suite of consulting solutions offerings, led by its regulatory risk and \ncompliance practice, primarily in financial services. \nProtiviti contributed \n30% \nof the Company\u2019s \nrevenue and  \n34% \nof the Company\u2019s  \ncombined segment  \nincome for the year.\n\n\n2023 Annual Report         Robert Half\n8\nWe enter 2024 confident in our ability to navigate the current business climate and optimistic about \nour growth prospects, which are built on our industry-leading brand, people and technology, and \na unique business model that includes both professional staffing and business consulting services. \nWe have weathered many economic cycles in the past, each time emerging to achieve higher peaks. \nWhile macroeconomic conditions have constrained client resource levels in the short term, this \nalso results in pent-up demand for talent and projects as business conditions improve. Also, aging \nworkforce demographics and clients\u2019 desire for flexible resources and variable costs are structural \ntailwinds that are expected to benefit us for many years to come.

The Company\u2019s corporate culture of diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d) enables it \nto leverage the representation and strengths of its workforce. In doing so, an environment is created where the enterprise\u2019s \nvalues anchor the work and cultivate a culture of growth and connection; attract, retain, and advance talented people; and \npositively impact clients and the communities where they live and serve. In 2023, the Company continued its support of the \nCEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge, published its DEI e-book \u201cA Shared Journey to Inclusivity,\u201d and furthered its \ncommitment by continuing to invest in key programs such as strategic alliance engagement, employee network group (\u201cENG\u201d) \nmaturation, and learning and development opportunities. \nThe Company places a high value on inclusion, engaging employees in its ENG programs which provide a community  \nfor individuals with various backgrounds, experiences, and identities, and their allies. These employee-led groups convene \naround common interests by sharing heritage and cultural traditions, investing in professional development and mentoring, \nimproving corporate culture, and delivering sustained business results. These groups support the attraction of historically \nunderrepresented talent internally and externally. Each ENG is sponsored and supported by executive leaders across the \nenterprise. Across Robert Half and Protiviti, there are 17 ENGs spanning gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability and \nmental health and well-being. \nAcross Robert Half and Protiviti, as of December 31, 2023, approximately 53.5% of the Company\u2019s global workforce \nidentified as female and 47.6% of the Company\u2019s employees in managerial and leadership roles identified as female. As of \nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 33.8% of the Company\u2019s U.S. workforce was from underrepresented groups.\nEmployee Engagement.    A major component in supporting employee engagement is the Robert Half employee voice \ninitiative to provide its employees with feedback opportunities. In 2023, the Company conducted two surveys to provide a \nforum to understand employee needs and gather feedback on a variety of focus areas. The survey results were analyzed by an \nindependent third-party and then reviewed by the executive officers. The results of these engagement surveys were shared with \nindividual managers, who were then tasked with acting based on their employees\u2019 confidential feedback (both quantitative and \nqualitative). In 2023, Robert Half and Protiviti conducted new hire surveys at specific points in a new hire\u2019s onboarding and \ndeparture surveys to exiting employees. By paying close attention to the results at an aggregate enterprise level and at a \ndepartment/business/workgroup level, across an employee\u2019s life cycle, the Company has been able to enhance its culture of \nrewards and recognition, drive efforts to promote inclusion and diversity, increase communication in support of employee well-\nbeing and modernize its approach to foster a culture of continuous learning and feedback. In addition, Robert Half continued its \nparticipation in the Great Place to Work\u00ae Survey to benchmark with other companies around the world. \nProtiviti uses an \u201cask, listen, respond, act\u201d approach to building trust through global surveys where employees provide \nanonymous feedback. Employee feedback is then carefully reviewed and analyzed to identify trends, which are shared with \nsenior leaders and communicated directly to employees. Changes based on employee feedback are highlighted so that \nemployees understand the importance of their input. Protiviti leverages surveys in the U.S. and internationally, including the \nGreat Place to Work\u00ae survey.\nLearning and Development.    The Company emphasizes employee development and training for our people and the \norganization. Training and development are key elements to the overall retention, engagement, and employee experience \nstrategy. Our strategy is designed to empower employees to reach their full potential, and the Company provides a wide range \nof development programs, opportunities, and resources needed to be successful. The Company has specialized programs for all \naudiences, including new hires, tenured employees, and leadership. The Company provides mentorship opportunities, self-\npaced and instructor-led learning channels, and a catalog of vendor-provided courses, videos, resources, and books. The \nCompany is committed to its employees\u2019 overall health and providing career progression by providing individual development, \nreadiness, and transition plans as a part of its talent review and succession planning process. Given our flexible work \nphilosophy, our learning strategy supports access and equity to all employees, including in-person and virtual learning \nexperiences. Comprehensive learning maps for the first year of our new hires and our front-line leaders provide a consistent, \npredictable and formal learning experience. Our learning strategy supports equity of access, just in-time learning and continued \ncareer development for our employees. \n4\n2023 Annual Report         Robert Half\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What percentage of Robert Half employees globally said the company is a great place to work, and how does this relate to the company's employee engagement efforts?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/7080eb38822436c9d45422a28826c207.png", "data/qwen_images/24547c662b0b3eccc3931501d8abef2c.png", "data/qwen_images/80aabf4a539e2fa71d54f5dac569c052.png", "data/qwen_images/95ff6da92853776fd7cbfc886e5fd8f6.png", "data/qwen_images/743653d449840a35aec1845640e3780c.png", "data/qwen_images/b399cebbca9943125c669140aa8423ee.png", "data/qwen_images/4a30224cc0d238e2f9835f463e5da2d2.png", "data/qwen_images/32b48a5d190b16ccd711ad365f70abf6.png", "data/qwen_images/d31e63f868d4cf2dd2c8d1c1863334e1.png", "data/qwen_images/7765da5e07bc8824e278b9df59b3ad03.png", "data/qwen_images/f21e9eae2563b1be52f31ca22cc53264.png"]}

Each of these trends has a multi-year lifespan, and while the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic volatility has slowed some and accelerated others, we expect all five trends\nto maintain their long-term trajectory and relevance over the next decade.

According\nto the International Energy Agency, real estate and the built environment account for nearly 40% of total global direct and\nindirect CO2 emissions. At the same time, stakeholders are demanding greater focus on ESG from businesses and\norganizations in all areas of society. These and other factors, including heightened awareness of the importance of promoting\nhealth and well-being, coalesce into strong rising demand for sustainability services and advice across the real estate industry.\nJLL has identified meeting this demand as a major growth opportunity and priority, aligning with our purpose to shape the\nfuture of real estate for a better world.\nRefer to our annual ESG Performance Report, available on our website, for further information.\nSTRATEGIC FRAMEWORK\nOur GEB has set out the Beyond strategic vision and framework to deliver long-term sustainable and profitable global\ngrowth.

operate across a wide variety of highly-competitive business lines within the commercial real estate industry globally.\nOur significant growth over the last decade, and our ability to take advantage of the consolidation which has taken place in\nour industry, have made us one of the largest commercial real estate services and investment management providers on a\nglobal basis, though the industry remains fragmented.\nAs we provide a broad range of commercial real estate and investment management services across many geographies, we\nface competition at international, regional and local levels. Increasingly, we also see companies who may not traditionally be\nconsidered real estate service providers, including investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms,\ntechnology firms, software-as-a-service companies, firms providing co-working space, firms providing outsourcing services\nof various types (including technology, food service and building products) and companies that self-perform their real estate\nservices with in-house capabilities, entering the market. Some of our primary competitors include large national or global\nfirms including CBRE Group Inc., Cushman & Wakefield plc, Colliers International Group Inc., Savills plc and Newmark\nGroup Inc.\nDISTINGUISHING ATTRIBUTES AND COMPETITIVE DII LRENTIATORS\nWe deliver exceptional strategic, fully-integrated services, best practices and innovative solutions for real estate owners,\noccupiers, investors and developers worldwide through an integrated global platform. We invest in technology and data\ncapabilities that provide our people and our clients with the best insights, driving productivity and client results. These\ncharacteristics, among others, distinguish us from our competitors, drive service excellence and customer loyalty, and\ndemonstrate our commitment to a sustainable future.\nWhile we face formidable competition in individual markets, the following are key attributes differentiating JLL for clients\nseeking real estate and investment management services across the globe.\nClient Relationship Management\nOur client-driven focus enables us to develop, sustain and grow long-term client relationships that generate repeat\nbusiness and create repeat revenue opportunities. Our clients are the center of our business model, and we enable\nsuperior service delivery through ongoing investments in the people, processes and tools that support client\nrelationship management. Our client experience management platform allows us to gather, understand and act on\nour clients' feedback.\nOur goal is to provide a holistic understanding of our clients' needs across our business, curate a customized\nexperience and identify the right management approach for our clients to drive accountability and bring the best\nof JLL. We achieve superior client service through best practices in client relationship management, seeking and\nacting on regular client feedback, and recognizing each client's own specific definition of excellence. We also\ninvest in developing the highest caliber talent dedicated to managing our client relationships through an employee\ncompensation and evaluation system aligned with our global career framework and designed to reward client\nrelationship building, teamwork and quality performance.\nGlobally Integrated Business Model and \"One JLL\"\nThrough the combination of a wide range of high-quality, complementary services, we develop and implement\nreal estate strategies that meet the increasingly complex and far-reaching needs of our clients. With operations\nspanning the globe, our in-depth knowledge of local, regional and international markets along with our \"One JLL\"\napproach - leveraging the ability and connectivity of our people - can provide services which address the entire\nlife cycle of real estate around the world. \"One JLL\" enables cross-selling opportunities across geographies and\nservice offerings that we expect will continue to develop new revenue sources and growth.\n18\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow does JLL's \"One JLL approach\" contribute to the company's resilience and ability to serve clients effectively in challenging market conditions?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/a1417254360d6414c88e5d32ead10e94.png", "data/qwen_images/d624e44f63e9bad1c48231514b613995.png", "data/qwen_images/2d1685e0456409d5b5db7f28b8f1a1d9.png", "data/qwen_images/84d814d6b51baa214e63e65cc0e4f769.png", "data/qwen_images/99bde12158c42af28e7255ce1703640c.png", "data/qwen_images/8e5f0797306a99c5b9bc787ea65be0ac.png", "data/qwen_images/6e1ecb81a6d4b9682d1a8bbd8dd21417.png"]}

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of\ndrillships, semi-submersible rigs, and jackup rigs for operations in shallow to ultra-deepwater in both benign and harsh environments. We contract our drilling units to drill wells\nfor our customers on a dayrate basis. Our customers include oil super-majors, state-owned national oil companies, and independent oil and gas companies. In addition, we\nprovide management services to certain affiliated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned a total of 19 drilling rigs, of which 15 were operating (inclusive of three leased to the Gulfdrill joint venture and one leased to the Sonadrill\njoint venture), three were cold stacked and one was warm stacked. The 15 operating units include ten floaters (comprising seven 7th generation drillships and three 6th\ngeneration drillships), two harsh environment units (comprising one semi-submersible unit and one jackup) and three jackups. In addition to our owned assets, as of December\n31, 2023, we managed two rigs owned by Sonangol.\nWe are recognized for providing high quality operations, in some of the most challenging sectors of offshore drilling. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately\n2,500 employees across the globe. We are incorporated in Bermuda and have worldwide operations based on where activities are conducted in the global oil and gas industry.\n2) Our Fleet\nOur relatively modern fleet, amongst the youngest in the industry, is well positioned compared with other major offshore drillers. As of December 31, 2023, our owned fleet was\n19 drilling units which included ten drillships, four semi-submersible rigs and five jackup rigs. For additional information on our drilling units and newbuildings refer to Item 4D\n- \"Property, Plant and Equipment\".\nWe categorize the drilling units in our fleet as (i) floaters, (ii) jackups and (iii) harsh environment. This is further explained below.\na) Floaters\ni.\nDrillships:\nDrillships are self-propelled ships equipped for drilling offshore in water depths ranging from 1,000 to 12,000 feet and are positioned over the well through a computer-\ncontrolled thruster system. Drillships are suitable for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load-carrying capacity. Depending on the country of\noperation, drillships operate with crews of 120 to 160 people.\nii.\nSemi-submersible drilling rigs:\nSemi-submersibles consist of an upper working and living quarters deck connected to a lower hull consisting of columns and pontoons. Such rigs operate in a \"semi-submerged\"\nfloating position, in which the lower hull is below the waterline and the upper deck protrudes above the surface. The rig is situated over a wellhead location and remains stable\nfor drilling in the semi-submerged floating position, due in part to its wave transparency characteristics at the water line.\nSemi-submersible rigs can be either moored or dynamically positioned. Moored semi-submersible rigs are positioned over the wellhead location with anchors and typically\noperate in water depths ranging up to 1,500 feet. Dynamically positioned semi-submersible rigs are positioned over the wellhead location by a computer-controlled thruster\nsystem and typically operate in water depths ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 feet. Depending on the country of operation, semi-submersible rigs generally operate with crews of\n110 to 130 people.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, Seadrill had available liquidity of $953 million, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $728 million, and available\nborrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $225 million.

U.S. revenues decreased by 13% to $4.96 billion \ncompared with 2022. International revenues decreased by 6% to $1.44 \nbillion compared with 2022 and accounted for 22% of the total revenue for \nthe Company in 2023.\nNet income was $411 million, or $3.88 per share, compared with net \nincome of $658 million, or $6.03 per share, in 2022. \nCash flow from operations for the year was $637 million, down 7% from \n$684 million in 2022. In 2023, we distributed $1.92 per share in cash \ndividends to our shareholders for a total cash outlay of $206 million. We \nalso repurchased approximately 3 million Robert Half shares during the \nyear for $232 million. Return on invested capital was 26% for the year. \nOur 2023 talent solutions revenues decreased by 15% to $4.46 billion \n\u2014 permanent placement revenue was down 22%, while contract talent \nsolutions revenue was down 14%.\nProtiviti revenues for 2023 were $1.93 billion, down 3% compared with \n2022. Protiviti contributed 30% of the Company\u2019s revenue and 34% of the \nCompany\u2019s combined segment income for the year. Protiviti continues to \ncompete very effectively in the marketplace, benefiting from its focused \nand nimble solutions offerings and its differentiated mix of professional \nresources, including priority access to scalable contract talent at all skill \nlevels sourced through our talent solutions practices.\nIn 2023, ongoing economic uncertainty impacted client and candidate confidence \nlevels, which lengthened their decision time frames and elongated our sales cycles. \nWhile labor demand remained resilient and talent shortages persisted, hiring activity \nand new project starts were impacted across the globe.

Operation is subject to \nthe following two conditions:\n(1) This device may not cause harmful interference,\n(2) This device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause \nundesired operation of the device. \nThe available scientific evidence does not show that any health problems are associated with \nusing low power wireless devices. There is no proof, however, that these low power wireless \ndevices are absolutely safe. Low power Wireless devices emit low levels of radio frequency \nenergy (RF) in the microwave range while being used. Whereas high levels of RF can produce \nhealth effects (by heating tissue), exposure of low-level RF that does not produce heating ef-\nfects causes no known adverse health effects. Many studies of low-level RF exposures have not \nfound any biological effects. Some studies have suggested that some biological effects might \noccur, but such findings have not been confirmed by additional research. Model 3952A has \nbeen tested and found to comply with ISED radiation exposure limits set forth for an uncon-\ntrolled environment and meets RSS-102 of the ISED radio frequency (RF) Exposure rules. \nData transmission is always initiated by software, which is the passed down through the MAC, \nthrough the digital and analog baseband, and finally to the RF chip. Several special packets \nare initiated by the MAC. These are the only ways the digital baseband portion will turn on the \nRF transmitter, which it then turns off at the end of the packet. Therefore, the transmitter will be \non only while one of the aforementioned packets is being transmitted. In other words, this de-\nvice automatically discontinue transmission in case of either absence of information to transmit \nor operational failure.\nCANADA UNIQUEMENT\nCAN ICES-003 (B)/NMB-003(B)\nPMN: 3952A\nIC: 11245A-3952A\nL\u2019\u00e9metteur/r\u00e9cepteur exempt de licence contenu dans le pr\u00e9sent appareil est conforme aux \nCNR d\u2019Innovation, Sciences et D\u00e9veloppement \u00e9conomique Canada applicables aux appar-\neils radio exempts de licence.

Equivalence of two action definitions does not depend on the naming of variables nor\non the order within conjunctions. Extrinsically, to measure actions\u2019 coherence, we use a BFS-based\nPDDL solver34 to attempt to solve ground-truth PFs with the predicted DF and report a success\nrate. An unsolved PF is caused by (1.) no plan can be found, or (2.) the solver runs for more than\n30 seconds, or (3.) the solver returns an error (usually a syntax error in generated PDDL).\nThe intrinsic and extrinsic results are shown in Table 5.1. gpt-3.5-turbo, also known as ChatGPT\nwhich achieves impressive performance on many tasks, has a close-to-zero performance. In contrast,\nits predecessor gpt-4 performs significantly better with 18% action prediction accuracy and 36%\nsolve rate of PFs based on the predicted DF. Still, the performance far worse than ideal, showing\nthat even a simplified open-domain planning formulation is challenging to state-of-the-art LMs.\nCoT is helpful overall since it explicitly spells out many implicit entities and state changes in the\nextraction stage which are critical to predicting preconditions and effects. In most situations, the\nmodel summarizes the action and extracts the entity states correctly, though sometimes missing a\nfew implicit entities. However, CoT\u2019s bottleneck lies in the translation stage, during which there\nare mainly three types of errors.\n(i). mismatched predicates: the model uses (at ?loc ?item) instead of (inventory ?item);\n(ii). hallucinating predicates: the model creates a new predicate (soaked ?item) while neglect-\ning the existing (submerged ?item);\n34https://github.com/pucrs-automated-planning/pddl-parser\n107\n\n\nModel %\nParameter\nPrecondition\nEffect\ngpt-4\n36.7\n31.1\n53.0\ngpt-4 + CoT\n42.2\n29.7\n48.1\nTable 5.2: Marginalized intrinsic performance of parameter, precondition, and effect.\nUnsolved\nSolved\nSyntax\nError\nBad\nAction\nGood\nAction\nBad\nPlan\nGood\nPlan\ngpt-4\n3\n7\n2\n0\n3\nTable 5.3: Statistics of error types on the development set.\n(iii). complicating predicates: the model adds unnecessary predicates (inventory ?submerged_item\n- item) when already has (inventory ?item).\nTo address these, we leave to future work to demonstrate and standardize the translation process by\nclearly describing when an entity change or stage change is and is not needed, while also encouraging\nthe model to strictly match the given predicates.\nFiner-grained evaluation results are shown in Table 5.2 to tease out the performance regarding such\ncomponent within an action. It is clear that the LM is worse at predicting preconditions than at\npredicting effects. This is understandable as procedural texts like wikiHow tend to be less explicit\nabout predictions than about effects (e.g., from bake for 10 minutes it is obvious that the food will\nbe baked, but it is unclear what state it had been in).\nTo provide deeper insights into model performance, we manually inspect the model output of gpt-4\non all 6 examples (15 PFs) in the development set. We consider the following scenarios.\nSyntax Error: Model output may contain illegal expressions that cannot be parsed. For example,\n(inventory ?player (clean ?strips)) is unacceptable because the arguments to a predicate\nmust be atomic types, not another predicate.\nUnsolved: Whenever the predicted DF cannot solve a PF, we identify the first problematic action\nthat differs with the ground-truth. For example, if the action cut_plant misses a critical effect\n108\n\n\nof (inventory ?player ?stalk), then other actions such as graft_stalk requiring it cannot be\nexecuted. At times, there could be false negatives where the predicted action definitions are in fact\nreasonable but still cannot lead to a solution.\nSolved: The predicted DF may solve a PF, but the plan may be different from the gold plan. It is\nnaturally possible that the predicted plan is a fluke made possible by under-specified preconditions\nor over-exaggerated effects, as well as loopholes in the PF leading to unreasonable shortcuts. For\nthe example in Figure 5.4, a model could cheat by defining the action get by not requiring the\nperson and object to be in the same location; thus, the predicted plan would unreasonably omit the\naction go. However, at times, the predicted plan could also be a reasonable alternative.\nThe statistics of these errors on the development set is shown in Table 5.3. When no solution can\nbe found, true negative is highly likely as the model indeed makes aforementioned mistakes during\naction prediction. When some solution is found, false positive is still possible as the predicted plan\nmay be unreasonable. See attached materials for a complete error analysis of these examples. Our\naforementioned future pipeline that separates summarization and translation would likely mitigate\nthese errors.\nThrough our experiments, it is clear that LLMs are capable of generating PDDL, specifically DF,\nand specifically action models, given noisy procedural texts. This is already a leap from previous\nwork devising specialized tools for each domain, mostly narrative texts.\nHowever, the problem\nremains that the current text-to-PDDL world building process is one-off and will not work if the\nenvironment dynamically develops. In the next section, I will focus on interactive environments\nwhere world building happens during exploration.\nThe work above was published in Zhang et al. (2024b), in which I formulated the task and primarily\ncontributed to the code to clean the dataset, run a PDDL planner, and perform evaluation. I also\nperformed the majority of the analysis. I have obtained approval from all collaborators to exclusively\ninclude this work in this thesis.\n109\n\n\nby an immediate sub-goal G\u2032, and the solver retries. The actions in the plan are then sequentially\nexecuted, resulting in a list of new observations.\n(o1\n2, o2\n2, . . . ) = exec(s1, a1\n1, a2\n1, . . . )\n(5.3)\nThus begins the second iteration. Using the new observations, the previous problem file is regener-\nated (referred to as PDDL-gen).\nPF2 = {LLM(PF1, o2), G}\n(5.4)\nThe process goes on until one observation fulfills the termination condition.\nUnlike prior work that generates the problem file once, pddlego\u2019s having LLMs iteratively gener-\nating the problem file often result in inconsistencies and errors (e.g., missing a connectivity relation\nbetween two rooms, using the name a room in a relation without declaring the room, missing a\nparenthesis, etc.). To tackle this, we have the LLMs only predict the change in the problem file\n(i.e., the change of entity states), which we deterministically applied to the previous problem file\n(referred to as PDDL-edit).\n\u22062 = LLM(PF1, o2), PF2 = PF1 + \u22062\n(4\u2019)\nWe will compare our two approaches above with the baseline where LLMs directly generate an\naction (referred to as Action-gen).\nPlani = LLM(oi)\n(2\u2019)\nEnvironments\nWe experiment with two goal-oriented, partially-observed simulated environments,\nor text games, that span a variety of difficulty and flavor.\nCoin Collector Yuan et al. (2019) focuses on navigation, which is an indispensable element of\n113\n\n\nEvaluation\nFor both simulations, we use the implementation from Jansen and C\u00f4t\u00e9 (2022). For\nCoin Collector, we use the most complex setting; for Cooking World, we consider an easy and a\nhard setting with varying number of locations and ingredients.\nFor the choice of LLM, we consider gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 (GPT 3.5 Turbo) and gpt-4-1106-preview\n(GPT 4 Turbo) across baseline methods (i.e., Action-gen, PDDL-gen, and PDDL-edit). For Action-\ngen, we prompt the LLM with a full description of the simulation, and for PDDL methods, with a\nhand-annotated domain file containing well-defined actions. For the PDDL-edit setting, we prompt\nthe LLM to generate templated edits (add, replace, and delete lines in the problem file). The prompt\nof each method include a 1-shot demonstration of the output format.\nRegarding performance, Table 5.4 shows a drastic performance degradation of Action-gen moving\nfrom Coin Collector (only 2 valid actions: move, open door each with 4 direction arguments) to\nthe much more complex Cooking World (with 8 more actions with infinite possible arguments, like\nprocessing an ingredient). Moreover, in Cooking World, an agent would fail if an ingredient is pro-\ncessed incorrectly (e.g., fried instead of grilled, was not chopped before roasted). Therefore, LLMs\ngenerating actions on the fly are more likely to make irrevocable mistakes and fail the task. In\ncontrast, our two-stage PDDL generation approaches ensure the correctness of the plan to process\nthe ingredients (in the second stage) assuming that the ingredients are gathered and that the appli-\nances are identified (in the first stage). Logically, the failures of pddlego indicates an inconsistency\nbetween the environmental observation and the problem file. For example, the connectivity of the\nrooms may not be updated correctly upon entrance to a new room, causing no plan or invalid plans\nto be found. By lessen the burden on LLMs, PDDL-edit notably ameliorates but cannot eliminate\nthis issue. On Coin Collector, issues frequently arise in a loop, where opening a new door leads\nto a visited room. Notably, GPT3.5 is far worse than GPT4 in generating PDDL, in line with the\nobservations by Zhang et al. (2024b) and Silver et al. (2023).\nRegarding efficiency, Figure 5.11 shows that on Coin Collector, PDDL-edit is no less efficient than\nAction-gen on 7 out 8 examples (red crosses are often lower than the blue circles) in the development\nset where PDDL-edit terminates successfully. Scaling up to the entire test set, with GPT4, PDDL-\n117\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: What are the most common types of errors encountered by GPT-4 when it fails to solve a PF, and how do these errors compare in frequency to the instances where GPT-4 successfully generates a good plan?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/093bfe42a407cc5b11b4cf7ef3babc88.png", "data/qwen_images/90c9b1875bd0d2e8dedff15da087a8af.png", "data/qwen_images/071d6ed91df7deb51cdd8b6b5bd40294.png"]}

In 2022, we conducted 3,439 public equity engagements and \n1,254 fixed income engagements.\nAs an active owner, we employ a variety of engagement tools depending \non the issuer, the issue being discussed and the accessibility of the \nissuer. Since our engagement efforts with a given issuer typically span a \nmultiyear period, it is common to utilize multiple methods of engagement, \nsuch as one-on-one meetings with company management teams, formal \nwritten communication and proxy voting. \nWhile the overwhelming majority of our engagement is done in \ncollaboration with companies and their management teams, we strongly \nbelieve that the exercise of investor rights prescribed in regulations and \ncompany bylaws are part of our responsibility in the pursuit of value \ncreation and the protection of our clients\u2019 investments. We believe \nengagement should not be a top-down dictated approach, but rather \ninvestment-driven, taking into consideration matters such as investment \nobjectives, issuer-specific circumstances and our history of engagement. \nWhere a company does not respond to our concerns or our concerns \nhave not been sufficiently addressed, we may take escalated action such \nas withholding support from directors, supporting a shareholder proposal, \nsending letters to the board of directors, making our concerns public, or \njoining a collaborative initiative, amongst others. The escalation tools \nleveraged will depend on the rights available to us and the circumstances \nof the case in question. Importantly, escalation methods are not exclusive \nand when an escalation method is utilized, we continue to seek to drive \nchange through private one-on-one engagements.\nEngagement is core to our investment process\u2014whether to inform our investment decision or as part of \nour stewardship of the asset. We embed stewardship responsibilities including engagement within our \ninvestment teams which we believe are crucial to integrating stewardship insights into the investment \nprocess and informing investment decisions. We look for companies where we can constructively exchange \ninsights with board members and management teams. As an active manager, we combine subject matter \nexpertise with fundamental insights to engage on financially material issues specific to a given company and \nits operating profile to drive sustainable value creation on behalf of our clients. Much of our engagement \nwith issuers arises organically from the investment diligence process, but we are also focused on ensuring \nthat the same attention and intensity are sustained throughout our stewardship of the asset. \nOur Approach to \nEngagement \n\n\n33\nBACKGROUND\nFirst Solar is U.S.-based company that manufactures solar \npanels\u2014a product that has come into increased demand \ndue to cost-competitiveness and policy support in the \nfight against climate change. It has been a holding of \nthe Neuberger Berman U.S. Equity Impact strategy since \ninception. Although viewing it as a leader in its field, \nwe believed there was additional potential, particularly \nrelating to capital investment choices. \nSCOPE AND PROCESS\nAs part of a cyclical industry, First Solar generated significant \ncash holdings through 2020 and was considering uses for \nthat capital, including calls from the investor community \nto return capital to shareholders. Although it had been \nhistorically hesitant to invest in new facilities given \nthe potential oversupply of panels, we advocated for \nexpansion of new capacity in the U.S., in the belief that \nit would not only prove profitable, but have a significant \npositive impact by increasing the capacity of the domestic \nsupply chain and reducing emissions. We continued a \ndialogue over the next two years on the manufacturing \nissue, on enhancing the independence of its board of \ndirectors and on setting science-based emission reduction \ntargets. As supply chain security and the environmental \nfootprint of solar moved up the priority lists of customers \nand policymakers, we also wanted the company to be \npositioned for any potential benefits. \nOUTCOME\nIn 2021, First Solar announced a $700 million investment \nin a new Ohio facility, as well as $700 million in a \nnew plant in India, creating more than 1,000 direct \nmanufacturing jobs. In the fall of 2022, President Biden \nsigned the Inflation Reduction Act, providing significant \ntax credits for U.S.-manufactured panel production, and \nadding to the competitive advantages enjoyed by First \nSolar\u2014something that was reflected in record bookings \nlast year. To further meet customer demand, the company \nannounced $1.4 billion in outlays for an Alabama \nproduction plant and an Ohio R&D center. In aggregate, \nthe announced capacity will help First Solar triple its \npositive impact from avoided emissions over 2020 levels \nwhile providing 3,000 manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and \nsupporting the addition of 15,000 jobs at other companies.\nIn addition, First Solar appointed its first lead independent \ndirector in 2021 and two new members to the board in \n2022, enhancing its governance profile. It also set science-\nbased emission targets to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 GHG \nemissions by 34% by 2028 and achieve net-zero emissions \nby 2050.\nCASE STUDY\nAdding Impactful Solar Capacity\nISSUE\nEnhancing Sourcing Reliability\nCATEGORY\nSupply Chain Management\nSTRATEGY\nU.S. Equity Impact\nSECTOR\nInformation Technology\n\n\nNEUBERGER BERMAN ANNUAL REPORT \u2013 JUNE 2023\n46\nAIA launched its formal ESG Strategy in March 2021\u2014but really \nthat was about recognizing what was already being done and \nformalizing it to build the foundation for the steps AIA is taking \nnow. Can you tell us about AIA\u2019s journey to this point?\nChi Zhang:\nWe have always recognized the importance of environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) factors to managing risk for our stakeholders within our \ngeneral account investment portfolio. Our analysts have been integrating \nthem into our investment process for many years, using both in-house \nresearch and specialist third-party data. We started to formalize these \nprocesses six or seven years ago. Our first ESG report was published \nin 2017. We signed up to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) in 2018, and we were one of the first Asian signatories \nto the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) \nin 2019. \nOur formal ESG strategy has five priorities: Deepening ESG engagement; \nAugmenting ESG training and capacity; Embedding ESG considerations; \nReviewing portfolio exclusions; and Carbon disclosing our portfolio. \nAs part of the fifth priority and our net-zero commitment, in 2021 we \nbegan drawing up our plan to submit emission-reduction operational \nand investment near-term targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative \n(SBTi) by this year, 2023. We shall disclose the total financed emissions \nfor all listed equities, and bonds issued by listed entities, whether held \ndirectly by AIA in-house or via managed accounts with our external asset \nmanagers, and for real estate and power generation project finance within \nour general account investment portfolio, which aligns with the SBTi and \nTCFD disclosure requirements. Additionally, as recommended by TCFD, \nwe shall disclose the weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our \ndirectly managed listed equity portfolio, although we do not have stated \ncommitments or targets in relation to WACI. \nSigning the PRI in 2019 was the main catalyst to develop our ESG Rating \nScorecard and our full corporate engagement program within our general \naccount investment portfolio. We consulted with many of our external \nasset managers on how to build effective ESG scoring processes, and \nhad our process reviewed and validated by an external party before \nrolling it out to 100% of the assets we directly manage in-house within \nour general account investment portfolio in 2022. That includes both \nequity and bond issuers; and corporates, governments, agencies and \ngovernment-like entities. Around 80% of our investment assets are fixed \nincome and almost half of that is government-issued, so that coverage \nis important. \nWe developed distinct Scorecards for corporates and for governments, \nas well as a Scorecard designed specifically to assess external asset \nmanagers on their ESG frameworks and processes. For example, how do \nthey incorporate ESG factors into investment decisions? Do they have \na dedicated stewardship team, or do they engage through their sector-\nspecialist analysts? \nAIA Group is the largest independent, publicly listed pan-Asian life insurance group with a total asset of \nmore than $300bn and underwriting more than 40 million individual insurance policies across the region. \nWe spoke to AIA Group\u2019s Head of Sustainable Investment Chi Zhang about building an ESG Strategy and \nhelping to achieve the net-zero transition in high carbon economies. \nLeading Sustainability \nin Asia\nTHE VOICE OF THE CLIENT\n\n\n50\nCLIENT PORTFOLIO METRICS\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nTeams with access to environmental, social and governance (ESG) research\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\nShareholder meetings voted (#/%)\n4,894/99%\n4,738/100%\n4,774/100%\n4,645/99%\n4,900/98%\nTOTAL NUMBER OF ENGAGEMENT MEETINGS WITH CORPORATE MANAGEMENT TEAMS\nNumber of equity engagements held \n1,324\n1,173\n2,213\n3,162\n3,439\nNumber of credit engagements held\n1,728\n901\n1,453\n1,463\n1,254\n% AUM engaged (public equity)\nN/A\nN/A\n71%\n78%\n85%\nPercentage of UCITS and mutual funds with 3+ Globes on \nMorningstar Sustainability Ratings\n50%\n73%\n68%\n76%\n83%\nCOMMUNITY METRICS\nCorporate charitable giving, $ Millions \n(foundation, gift matching, disaster relief) \nEMPLOYEE METRICS\nTotal full-time employees, globally\n2018\n2.55\n2019\n2.96\n2020\n2.85\n2021\n2.41\n2022\n3.07\n2,036\n2018\n2,178\n2019\n2,305\n2020\n2,411\n2021\n2,657\n2022\n2022 Firm \nStakeholder Metrics\n\n\nNEUBERGER BERMAN ANNUAL REPORT \u2013 JUNE 2023\n53\n4 \u0007Prior to 2020 Neuberger Berman reported on the portion of the building\u2019s energy use controlled by the firm.

{"query": "Context:\n\nChapter 1\nMargin-based complexity measures\nhave been proposed. These include theoretically proven bounds on the generalization error, such\nas Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension [6] and PAC-Bayesian bounds [7]. However, in the case\nof DNNs these bounds are generally not sufficiently tight to be practically useful [8]\u2013[10]. In\nfact, recent work [8] suggests that in the overparameterized setting, these bounds cannot be tight\nwithout making strong assumptions about the data distribution. A complementary approach\nto developing theoretical bounds is to develop empirical techniques that are able to predict\nthe generalization ability of certain families of DNN models. That is, techniques that are able\nto estimate or rank the generalization performance of a set of models using only the models\u2019\ntraining data and parameters.\nPredicting the generalization of a given model, or set of models, is important for several reasons:\n\u2022 An accurate measure of generalization could lead to a better theoretical understanding of\nthe mechanisms behind generalization in DNNs.\n\u2022 Such a measure could aid in model selection.\n\u2022 Should a measure be predictive of generalization, it could be possible to incorporate it\nin the training process, e.g. as a regularization term, which could further improve the\nperformance of DNNs.\n\u2022 In some settings, sufficient data is not available in order to estimate the generalization\nability of a model on a held-out dataset. Generalization prediction techniques can then be\nused to determine the model\u2019s performance.\nPredicting the generalization of DNNs is generally achieved through the use of a complexity\nmeasure, where a complexity measure is defined as some measurement of the network parameters\nor representations that correlates well with its generalization ability [9]. One class of complexity\nmeasures that has shown promise is that of margin-based measures.\n1.2\nMargin-based complexity measures\nMargin-based measures, as the name implies, rely on measuring margin: the shortest distance\nto the decision boundary from a training or test sample. Margins are ubiquitous in machine\n2\n\n\nChapter 1\nScope\nlearning and have long been studied in relation to generalization, such as in Support Vector\nMachines [11] or ensembles [12]. However, as we will show, the link between large margins and\ngeneralization in DNNs is not as clearly established.\nAn interesting property of margin analysis in DNNs is that margins can be measured at multiple\nrepresentational spaces throughout the network, such as in the input space (input margin), the\nhidden representational space (hidden margin), and the output space (output margin). Each\nof these measurements has distinct properties and comes with certain benefits and drawbacks\nwhen used to predict generalization (which we discuss later).\nIn this study, we investigate these margin-based generalization prediction methods in DNNs. We\nanalyze these in various settings, such as for different types of samples, architectures, datasets,\nand training setups. In doing so, we identify where these metrics succeed and fail, how these\nmetrics compare to each other, and shed some light on why they do or do not work in specific\nscenarios.\nIn addition to the investigation of generalization, the field of margins in DNNs is also closely\nrelated to the field of adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are perturbed training or\ntest samples that appear visually identical to their normal counterparts; however, they are\nconsistently misclassified by DNNs.\nThroughout this study, we also contribute to a better\nunderstanding of such adversarial examples.\nIn summary, our primary goal is to further an understanding of margin-based complexity\nmeasures. We aim to establish under which conditions these metrics do and do not work,\nhow the different variants compare to one another, why they work, and what insights into\ngeneralization they can contribute.\nIn the following section, we narrow down the scope of our investigations.\n1.3\nScope\nIn this section, we specify the scope of our investigations surrounding margin-based generaliza-\ntion prediction methods.\n3\n\n\nChapter 1\nOverview\n\u2022 Chapter 2: Background. In this chapter, we introduce the setting in which we analyze\nmargins, the necessary evaluation metrics, and the benchmarks that we use. In addition,\nwe provide a comprehensive overview of existing margin-based generalization prediction\nmethods, as well as other relevant complexity measures.\n\u2022 Chapter 3: Margins and sample noise. We begin our investigation of margins in a\nvery controlled setting. Specifically, we investigate how margin measurements relate to\ndifferent types of samples across models of increasing capacity. To this end, we corrupt\ntraining datasets using different types of sample noise, which allows us to simulate real-\nworld scenarios such as mislabeled or otherwise noisy data. We then train multiple MLPs\nand CNNs of varying sizes on this corrupted data. Furthermore, we analyze these results\nand provide reasons for the observed behavior. This allows us to understand how different\nsample types influence the margin behavior and robustness properties of a trained DNN.\n\u2022 Chapter 4: Evaluating input and hidden margins on PGDL. In this chapter, we\nturn our attention to the PGDL benchmark. We use this benchmark to do a thorough\nanalysis of existing margin-based complexity measures for generalization prediction. We\ncompare these methods and determine in which cases these metrics succeed or fail to\npredict generalization. Additionally, we establish whether measuring these margins in a\nmore accurate fashion increases their predictive performance.\n\u2022 Chapter 5: Input margins can predict generalization too. In the previous chapter,\nwe find that input margins are generally not predictive of generalization. In this chapter, we\naddress the issues surrounding input margins. More precisely, we provide a clear intuition\nfor why margins measured in the input space are not predictive of generalization. We then\nuse this intuition to design a new measure that combines input margins with the principal\ncomponents of the dataset. We refer to this measure as \u2018constrained margin\u2019. This new\ncomplexity measure is then compared to other margin-based complexity measures, as well\nas to the complexity measures of others. Furthermore, we also establish a link between\nadversarial examples and the principal components of the dataset.\n\u2022 Chapter 6: Conclusion.: Finally, in this chapter, we summarize the observations and\ncontributions made throughout the study. Additionally, we also discuss these findings,\nidentify directions for future work, and speculate on some of the unanswered questions.\n5\n\n\nChapter 5\nVariance and adversarial perturbations\nother complexity measures in Table 5.3, constrained margins have the highest CMI for Task 8\nand the second highest for Task 7. This suggests that these tasks are inherently difficult when it\ncomes to generalization prediction. This makes sense, as the models in these two tasks have the\nsmallest variation in test accuracy between them. Recall Table 2.1 in Section 2.4. This suggests\nthat current complexity measures (including ours) are not sensitive enough to account for such\nslight variations in performance between models.\nDespite these limitations, we note that the resulting scatter plots of mean constrained margin\nversus test accuracy for all three of these tasks do not show points in the lower right (large\nmargin but low generalization) or upper left (small margin but high generalization) quadrants.\nIt is therefore possible that a larger mean constrained margin is always beneficial to a model\u2019s\ngeneralization, even though it is not always fully descriptive of its performance.\n5.5\nVariance and adversarial perturbations\nThe question of \u2018why do adversarial examples exist?\u2019 is an open problem in the field of adversarial\nmachine learning. Many hypotheses have been put forward, yet the question remains mostly\nunanswered after a decade of research [95]. An exhaustive discussion of the many hypotheses and\nideas that have been investigated surrounding the existence of adversarial examples is outside\nour scope. Rather, we provide a brief summary of influential work. For further details, see\nrelevant reviews on this topic such as [96] and [97].\nGoodfellow et al. [15] attribute the existence of adversarial examples to the high linearity of\nDNNs.\nThey state that this is in constrast to many initial speculations, which attributed\nthe existence of adversarial examples to high non-linearity.\nTheir support for this linearity\nhypothesis is motivated by the success of the very simple fast-gradient sign method (FGSM) [15]\nfor generating adversarial examples. This method simply identifies a direction which maximizes\nthe model\u2019s loss w.r.t. the attacked sample. The sample is then perturbed (using a set size)\nin that direction. They argue that such a simple method only works due to the linearity of\nthe model. Some time later, Goodfellow states that adversarial perturbations are likely in the\ndirections of a different class\u2019s centroid [98].2\n2Note that here we cite a statement made during a lecture (as done in [95]). Perhaps we need not take this\nsingle remark too seriously.\n109\n\n\n[10]\nP. Natekar and M.

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\n\u00a0\nSIEMs and similar log management products are designed for compliance, reporting, and security incident management purposes, but they struggle with the scale and processing required to deliver the behavioral-analysis \ncapabilities across current and historical data to detect new or modified versions of known threats. While these systems provide useful correlation capabilities, security operation teams are increasingly leveraging these \nsystems for central aggregation points for workflow, ticketing, and case management, rather than for detection.\nFirst generation network-based behavioral analysis products\nFirst generation network-based behavioral analysis products provide a basic level of outlier detection using Bayesian analysis or other statistical methods to identify obvious patterns in small networks. Often marketed as AI \nsolutions, these solutions lack the scale, correlation, or analysis capabilities needed to detect threats hiding in plain sight within networks commonly seen at mid-sized or larger enterprises with thousands of devices, hundreds \nof applications, multiple physical sites, and multi-cloud architectures.\nInfrastructure monitoring/network performance monitoring and diagnostic-based products\nTraditional network infrastructure providers offer infrastructure monitoring products designed to identify network bottlenecks and other network reliability or performance issues. Increasingly, these vendors have added bolt-on \ncybersecurity capabilities that can provide security teams\u2019 networks with asset discovery and some network visibility, but they struggle with the algorithmic analysis needed to detect new and unknown threats with high fidelity \nor the forensic capabilities required by security operations team to investigate, triage, and respond to an identified network anomaly.\nThreat intelligence sharing products\nThreat intelligence products are designed to share massive amounts of non-specific signature-based IoCs that commonly focus on IP addresses and domains of known threats and often only after a substantial period of time by \nthe contributing organization. The lack of timeliness or specificity to an enterprise severely limits the effectiveness of the shared information from a cyber defense perspective. By the time this information is shared, usually \nweeks or months after an attack, a sophisticated attacker only needs to slightly modify their methods by changing their attack infrastructure to enable them to bypass cyber defenses of their targeted enterprises, industries, or \nnations.\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Centers (\u201cISACs\u201d) and other threat sharing groups\nThreat sharing groups emerged more than 20 years ago as a way for security teams to work together to collect, analyze, and share actionable threat information within their member communities. We believe this is a substantial \nstep in the right direction; however, threat sharing in these groups relies largely on signature-centric threat intelligence platforms that struggle with timeliness and specificity of their intelligence or ad hoc manual forms of \ncommunication, such as email and only with a subset of security defenders with whom an analyst has a personal relationship. ISACs and similar groups are the right organizations, but they need technological solutions that \nenable them to share contextual, relevant, and timely information in real time across the full community.\nCreating a new market segment: Collective Defense\nWe are creating a new market category with Collective Defense. With our Collective Defense platform, we developed the first and, to our knowledge, the only solution that can identify and rate anomalous behaviors on the \nnetwork and share this anonymized threat intelligence among Collective Defense community members (who may comprise a supply chain, state, or country) as an early-warning system for all.\nThe power of Collective Defense is that multiple companies can essentially work as a team to detect and defend against attackers early in the network threat intrusion cycle. This differentiated approach allows customers to:\nGain real-time visibility across the threat landscape\nOur Collective Defense platform leverages proven behavioral analytics, ML, and AI techniques across anonymized participant data to identify stealthy, sophisticated threats that otherwise may be missed by an individual \nenterprise and signature-based tools. The platform has been designed to deliver real-time visibility of cyber threats targeting supply chains, industries, regions, or any custom IronDome Collective Defense grouping.\nReduce impact of cyber attacks with help from fellow cyber defenders\nOur Collective Defense ecosystem acts as a collaboration hub to enable participants to automatically share real-time detections, triage outcomes, threat indicators, and other insights with members of their Collective Defense \ngroup. When suspicious behaviors are identified by any member, IronDome automatically shares a proactive warning to all members at machine speed so each member can prioritize their defense against the identified cyber \nthreat.\nImprove effectiveness of existing cybersecurity investments\nThreat intelligence is valuable, actionable, and relevant only when received in time, before a threat enters a network. Our innovative collective threat intelligence provides immediate alerts at machine speed and context into \nurgent threats, enabling organizations to prioritize threats and build a proactive defense. This information can be used by a customer\u2019s existing network, endpoint, or other security tools to identify and stop adversaries from \nretargeting their attack.\nThe following diagram depicts several differences between legacy approaches and our new approach:\n\u00a0\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur Solution: The IronNet Collective Defense Platform\nOur anonymized IronNet Collective Defense platform comprises two tightly integrated proprietary technologies: Our NDR solution, IronDefense, and our innovative collective threat-sharing solution, IronDome.\nOur platform offers a unified set of technologies that powers a wide range of network behavioral detection, security operations, real- time threat landscape visibility, threat sharing, and peer SOC-analyst collaboration \ncapabilities. By focusing on cloud deployments, we are able to more rapidly and cost effectively deploy in our customers' environments, 83.6% of which by revenue were in the public cloud as of January 31, 2023. Our \nexpanding set of open APIs and ecosystem integrations enable us to add new sources of data for behavioral analysis and Collective Defense sharing and collaboration to detect and stop targeted cyber attacks.\nArmed with elite detection capabilities and combined offensive operator experience at the highest level of the U.S. government, our founders set out to build a behavioral analytics solution to detect threats heading toward, \nor already in, the network. A growing portfolio of proprietary analytics forms the backbone of IronDefense.\nHowever, while effective in detecting unknown anomalies, behavioral analytics by itself is insufficient in modern, noisy networks where anomalies are common and can lead to a high number of false positives. For many \nNDR vendors in the industry, the solution is to tune their analytics to be less sensitive in order to deliver reduced false-positive rates at the expense of letting true positives into the network. We undertook a different strategy \nto meet this challenge. We introduced our expert system scoring algorithms, supported by our elite cyber hunters, to increase IronDefense's detection specificity while preserving the sensitivity of its analytics.\nPowered by IronDefense\u2019s threat detections, IronDome, which we introduced in 2018, is the foundation of our Collective Defense platform, a purpose-built, cloud-native, and holistic platform that is capable of defending, \nanalyzing, and correlating threats from various sources. It delivers timely, actionable, and contextual insights to attacks targeting an enterprise and, from there, is able to provide early warning to all members of the \nCollective Defense ecosystem.\nThe differentiated value of our Collective Defense platform is its ability to build a dynamic, comprehensive picture of the threat environment, much like radar for cyberspace, based on real-time, anonymized alert correlation \nacross any participating member environments. It also provides situational context and peer insights for greater visibility and context of the threat landscape at any given time.\nIn August 2022, we announced our membership in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (\"JCDC\") and an agreement with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\"CISA\") to share information from our \nCollective Defense platform to help the agency defend against increased global cyber threats. In February 2023, we formalized a new public sector partnership establishing a communications channel between our threat \nanalysts and the DoD. The channel is intended to facilitate active collaboration of known and emerging threats, enabling us to inform the DoD of threat activity in near real time and vice versa. Through this public-private \npartnership, our anonymized IronDome data, in addition to our IronRadar visibility into key threat related C2 Server findings, is an important advancement of our collective defense mission.\nCorrelated alerts for threat detection earlier in the intrusion cycle\nWe are not aware of any other vendor in the market with a similar approach to cybersecurity. Even though community members bring disparate network environments, such as cloud, on-premise or hybrid, to the Collective \nDefense ecosystem, correlated threats stand out given that the adversarial behaviors are typically consistent, no matter who the target is.\nOur Collective Defense platform comprises two flagship products:\nIronDefense\nIronDefense is an advanced NDR solution that provides behavior-based and AI-driven analytics at the network level to detect anomalous activity at individual enterprises and prioritize the highest threats in a company\u2019s \nnetwork. We leverage novel AI/ML algorithms to deliver high-fidelity analytics required to detect previously unknown threats. In addition, we provide advanced enrichment techniques via IronDefense\u2019s Expert System, \nwhich has been designed to achieve high efficacy levels, low false positive rates, and improved visibility compared to legacy approaches. This is all done at network speed and cloud scale.\nMost current cybersecurity tools focus on detecting the final \u201caction-on-target\u201d step of an intrusion. At this stage, identification is easier but the insights come far too late to stop attackers from getting into positions in the \nnetwork to exfiltrate data, steal IP, or accomplish other malicious objectives. IronDefense uses advanced analytics based on metadata from the traffic in the customer\u2019s network to identify anomalous activity earlier in the \nintrusion kill chain.\nKey components of IronDefense include:\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\nIronDefense behavioral analysis engine\nIronDefense leverages behavior-based and correlation-based detections to identify threats targeting industries and companies earlier in the intrusion cycle, and to identify the underlying behavior and methods to counter \nunknown threats, or customizations that attackers will implement to target companies in the future. Our behavioral analytics are built upon algorithms that form the foundation of our patented IronDefense platform. They are \ncomputationally designed to understand normal network behavior by applying tests to create a benchmark of standard, acceptable traffic patterns in the network. Detected anomalies are grouped with similar instances of \ntraffic behavior to minimize alerting and to aggregate events within the customers\u2019 networks. IronDefense enhancements in March 2022 include the ability to detect malicious payloads, allowing for better protection of \nmanaged and unmanaged devices from malware, ransomware, and APTs.\nIronDefense Expert System\nIronDefense includes an Expert System that automates security operations playbooks of how top cyber operations hunters leverage contextual data and other sources of telemetry data later on in the detection and response \nprocess and applies it to the risk scoring of anomalies detected by its behavioral analysis. This enables us to preservice IronDefense's detection accuracy without sacrificing the sensitivity of its algorithms by leveraging the \nwisdom of our elite cyber hunters triaging thousands of alerts from real-world environments. Our Expert System also alleviates the \u201calert fatigue\u201d that plagues every SOC by minimizing the tedious steps in an investigation, \nreducing alert fatigue and allowing security teams to focus on responding to high risk detection in their environments. The Expert System is continually optimized through machine learning from anonymized triaged \noutcomes by our cyber hunters using IronDefense.\nIronDefense correlation threat engine\nThreat analysts and hunters spend a significant portion of their time triaging individual alerts by identifying corroborating evidence and related information. In March 2022, we launched a new threat correlation engine for the \nautomated correlation of detections and alerts. The threat engine models adversary attack techniques and pre-correlates anomalous activity by threat categories to improve risk scoring and alert prioritization, as well as to \ndramatically reduce alert load. This system leverages a multi-pass system that first optimizes for detecting as many potential instances of a particular type of threat activity and enriching detections with threat intelligence and \nother external and internal data sources to optimize for detection precision. Events are further aggregated by entity information, attack stage identification, and time sequence data to deliver a timeline of an attack and scored by \nrisk to the enterprise.\nIronDefense threat hunting interface\nIronDefense includes a threat hunting interface built by our elite cyber hunters to empower security operations teams to conduct detailed investigative workflows and forensic analysis of threats detected by IronDefense. The hunting \ninterface empowers security analysts to investigate across all raw traffic, network metadata, logs, telemetry data, and collective threat intelligence captured by IronDefense, all the way down to full-packet capture of individual \nnetwork flows. In March 2022, we enhanced the platform\u2019s hunt panel for extended hunt capabilities, expanding the investigation window to 30, 60, and 90 days (per individual customer service level agreement) over metadata and \nthe associated packet capture (\"PCAP\") data. This capability offers IronNet customers a fully integrated hunt platform designed for easy pivoting from an isolated alert down to the metadata and full PCAP associated with that alert, \nproviding more time to respond and triage based on longer-term historical analysis and historical context. \nIronDefense sensors\nIronDefense sensors are cloud, virtual, and physical sensors that are deployed at the network perimeter to ingest \u201cnorth-south\u201d traffic within internal networks to provide \u201ceast-west\u201d traffic visibility across an enterprise. Cloud \nsensors are available for public cloud environments to ingest raw traffic data directly from Infrastructure-as-a-Service virtual networks from Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), a major cloud provider. The sensor extracts rich \nnetwork session metadata from the raw traffic and sends it to our behavior analysis engine for processing and expert system validation. The IronDefense sensors also continuously collect full raw traffic packet capture for \ninspection during hunting operations.\nIronDefense direct data ingest\nIronDefense has the ability to utilize a wide-range of data types and telemetry data directly from existing sources. These data sources include standard protocols such as DNS, HTTP/S, or Active Directory; common network \nlog formats such as BRO/ZEEK or NetFlow; Cloud Provider logs such as AWS VPC, AWS CloudTrail or Microsoft Azure NSG logs; and application logs such as Office 365.\nIronDome\nIronDome is a threat-exchange solution that facilitates a crowdsourced-like environment in which the IronDefense findings from an individual company are automatically and anonymously exchanged within groups of related \nentities, such as portfolio companies, supply chains, industries, or nations, for correlation and further analysis. IronDome analyzes threat detections across companies to identify broad attack patterns and provides anonymized \nintelligence back to all customers in real time, serving as an early warning system for all.\nIronDome enables Collective Defense member enterprises to actively exchange individual anonymized cyber anomalies at machine speed across a community of public-private peers. This capability allows companies to \nidentify stealthy attackers earlier in the attack cycle when many of their methods fall below the threshold of detection at a single company by allowing companies to aggregate data and run higher-order analysis across industry \ndata.\nKey components of IronDome include:\nIronDome Collective Defense communities\nIronDome threat exchange is organized by communities of enterprises based on their business ecosystem, industry, region, or nation. Enterprises can be members of multiple communities based on their sharing \npreference and threat sharing needs. As customer adoption grows, the network effect of each additional enterprise participating in IronNet\u2019s Collective Defense platform will amplify the breadth and depth of its dataset \nand intelligence.\nIronDome collective threat intelligence exchange\nIronDome links together communities of enterprises to provide contextual insights into the threat landscape. Machine and human intelligence is shared in real time across the community by threat correlations, as well as \noutcomes and insights related to how various analysts at different enterprises rated and triaged similar threats in their environment. Real-time feedback of these insights delivers enhanced threat landscape visibility and \ndetection insights that allow members to immediately react to active threats targeting their industry and to adjust their defenses to combat the threat.\nIronDome Cyber Radar View\nIronDome creates a radar-like view of cyberspace that links private and public sector stakeholders in their Collective Defense community. The dashboard provides an anonymized real-time view of threats targeting an \nenterprise\u2019s business ecosystem, supply chain, industry, or region. \nCalled Collective Defense communities, spearheaded by a \u201ccornerstone\u201d company or organization, an IronDome could be established for a company\u2019s business ecosystem, such as a wealth management firm with many \nportfolio companies; a sector-based collaborative, such as in within energy or finance), or a cross-sector formation; states and countries; and private-public sector configurations.\nIn each Collective Defense community, members agree to share anonymized data about threats detected on their individual networks with the collective, on an ongoing basis. This collaborative approach is designed to \u201cflip \nthe script\u201d on attackers by raising the defensive capabilities of any one player. If correlated alerts and attribution based on behaviors suggest that a nation-state is involved, Collective Defense participants can voluntarily \nshare threat information with \n11\n\n\n\u00a0\nLeveraging decades of cybersecurity experience, our results-focused training programs enable customers to unlock a higher level of cyber resilience. We adopt a hands-on approach to build technical proficiency and \noperational confidence using industry best practices. Cyber skillset training techniques include hunt methodology, offensive methodology, data analytics for security intelligence, SOC leadership, cyber threat intelligence \noperations, executive education, and custom cyber threat seminars.\nSales and Marketing\nDuring the second half of 2022, fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we significantly reduced our company headcount, notably in sales and marketing. We refocused a smaller and now more senior direct sales force on a strategy \ntargeting larger public and private sector organizations with a more sophisticated cyber stack. We believe we have a differentiated ability to convene CEOs, CISOs, and other leaders within an entire industry, such as energy \ncompany CEOs. We have a sales team presence in the United States as well as sales leadership in EMEA. \nOur marketing organization employs high-tech multichannel digital and content marketing for lead generation, public relations, social media and thought leadership programs to drive awareness. Our public relations and media \nprogram has resulted in coverage in business press, cybersecurity trade media and industry trade media.\nOur event program is focused on exposure to audiences that are aligned to our refocused sales strategy. We incorporate a combination of both large industry events with regional and sector-focused field marketing events that \nallow us to capture leads on new customers. We also have an integrated thought leadership program wherein we host monthly webinars with our executives, customers, and other thought leaders, in addition to participating in \npartner hosted-webinars and invited opportunities (e.g., America\u2019s Future Series).\nWe focus on providing compelling content for both demand generation and awareness-building. Our monthly Threat Intelligence Briefs summarize the IOCs and detections our SOC has discovered in order to inform the efforts \nof other operations analysts in the cybersecurity space. Our threat researchers produce in-depth analysis on topics such as ransomware detection and unique technical observations about the SUNBURST attack, Log4j, cyber \nimplications of the Ukraine-Russia war, and other topics, which have been featured in media outlets. We believe this helps build credibility with the security analyst audience, a key influencer in the buying process.\nOur Partnership Ecosystem\nOur partner ecosystem consists of leading organizations that have been carefully selected to help us deliver the power of Collective Defense across a variety of dimensions.\nTechnology partners\nWhen used together, our partner integrations leverage our collective threat intelligence to react in real time, as well as proactively combat threats across the entire network, and create workflows that mitigate compromised \ndevices.

Under the JOBS Act, EGCs can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment \nof the JOBS Act until those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with certain new or revised accounting standards that have \ndifferent effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date the Company (i) is no longer an EGC or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period \nprovided in the JOBS Act. As a result, the consolidated financial statements may or may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public \ncompanies\u2019 effective dates.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal Year 2023\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cTopic 842\u201d), which outlines a comprehensive lease \naccounting model that supersedes the previous lease guidance. The guidance requires lessees to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets for all leases with lease terms greater than 12 \nmonths. It also changes the definition of a lease and expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements, \nwhich provides the option of an additional transition method that allows entities to initially apply the new lease guidance at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening \nbalance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company adopted the standard on February 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective basis. Using the modified retrospective approach, the \nCompany determined an incremental borrowing rate at the date of adoption based on the total lease term and total minimum rental payments. \nThe modified retrospective approach provides a method for recording existing leases at adoption with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The Company elected the package of practical \nexpedients which permits the Company to not reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) any initial \ndirect costs for any expired or existing leases as of the effective date. The Company also elected the practical expedient to use hindsight when determining the lease term, and the practical expedient lease \nconsiderations to not allocate lease considerations between lease and non-lease components for real estate leases. As such, real estate lease considerations are treated as a single lease-component and \naccounted for accordingly. The Company excludes leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from the application of Topic 842. \nAdoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of $974 and $2,654 of current operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities, respectively, and $2,685 in corresponding right-of-\nuse (\u201cROU\u201d) lease assets on that date. The difference between the approximate value of the ROU lease assets and lease liabilities is attributable to deferred rent, which is comprised of tenant improvement \nallowance and rent abatement. There was no material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statement of cash flows as a result of the adoption of Topic 842. The \nCompany\u2019s comparative periods continue to be presented and disclosed in accordance with legacy guidance in Topic 840. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\u2014Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): \nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required \nunder current U.S. GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings \nper share calculation in certain areas. ASU 2020-06 is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 or the time at which the Company no longer qualifies as an EGC, with early adoption \npermitted. The Company elected to early adopt this ASU as of February 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 had an immaterial impact on the Company\u2019s \nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326). This standard requires a new method for recognizing credit losses that is referred to as \nthe current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) method. The CECL method requires the recognition of all losses expected over the life of a financial instrument upon origination or purchase of the instrument, \nunless the Company elects to recognize such instruments at fair value with changes in profit and loss (the fair value option). This standard is effective for the Company for the earlier of the fiscal year \nbeginning after December 15, 2022 or the time at which the Company no longer qualifies as an EGC. As a result, this ASU became effective for the Company as of February 1, 2023. Management does not \nexpect the impact of adopting this standard to be material.\n2.\nRevenue\nProduct, subscription and support revenue\nThe Company sells a collective defense software solution that is comprised of two product offerings, IronDefense and IronDome. Through December 2022, the software platform was delivered through both \non-premises licenses bundled with on-premises hardware and through subscription software. The Company stopped offering on-premises deployment options in December 2022. During fiscal year 2023, \nthe Company launched IronRadar, a new product intended to broaden the Company's market reach to companies of all sizes that is delivered via subscription software.  \nThe security appliance deliverables include proprietary operating system software and hardware together with regular threat intelligence updates and support, maintenance, and warranty. The Company \ncombines intelligence dependent hardware and software licenses with the related threat intelligence and support and maintenance as a single performance obligation, as it delivers the essential functionality \nof the cybersecurity solution. The Company recognizes revenue for this single performance obligation ratably over the expected term. Judgement is required for the assessment of material rights relating to \nrenewal options associated with the Company's contracts.\nRevenue from subscriptions, which allow customers to use the Company's security software over a contracted period without taking possession of the software, and managed services, where the Company \nprovides managed detection and response services for customers, is recognized over the contractual term. The cloud-based subscription revenue, where the Company also provides hosting, recognized for \nthe fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $21,457 and $15,960, respectively. Overall product, subscription, and support revenue recognized for the years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 \nwere $25,703 and $25,347, respectively. \nProfessional services revenue\nThe Company sells professional services, including cyber operations monitoring, security, training and tailored maturity assessments. Revenue derived from these services is recognized as the services are \ndelivered. Revenue recognized from professional services for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,554 and $2,197, respectively.\nCustomer concentration\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, eight customers accounted for 61%, or $16,536, with two of those customers accounting for 22% of the Company's revenue, and for the fiscal year ended January \n31, 2022, six customers accounted for 51%, or $13,975, with two of those customers accounting for 21%, of the Company\u2019s revenue. As of January 31, 2023, and January 31, 2022, two customers \nrepresented 56% and 49% of the total accounts receivable balance, respectively.\n61\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How does the \"New Approach\" described in the image fundamentally change the way organizations collaborate and share information about cyber threats compared to the \"Old Approach\"?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/bb41a10e6ad552e10d9bc9f763c383a9.png"]}

Our sales projection is driven\nby continued end-market demand in water heating and a rebound in boiler and water treatment volumes afte\nf r 2023\ncorrections in end-market inventories. In our Rest of the World segment, we see overall growth with stability in China as the\neconomy continues to work through its challenges. We expect to achieve full-year earnings of between $3.90 and $4.15 per\nshare. Our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are governed by a number of federal, foreign, state, local and environmental laws concerning the generation\nand management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by\nthe Company or third parties. We have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. Expenditures\nrelated to environmental matters were not material in 2023 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year. We\nhave reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with\navailabl\na e insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonabl\na y anticipated remediation costs. Although we believe that our\noperations are subs\nu\ntantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedur\nd\nes designed to maintain compliance, there\nare no assurances that subs\nu\ntantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. However, since the same\nlaws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nRisk Management\nWe evaluate risk to our business in a number of ways, primarily through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process,\nwhich we conduct enterprise-wise on a periodic basis, and seeks to identify\nf\nand address significant and material risks. Our\nERM process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the Enterprise\ni\nRisk\ni\nManagement-Integr\ne\nated Framework\nr\n(2017) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO). We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. Our goal is to manage\nrisks prude\nr\nntly rather than avoid risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on our company only to a limited extent.\n26\n\n\nResearch and development. Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to $97.5\nmillion, $89.0 million and $94.2 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEnvironmental costs. The Company accrues for costs associated with environmental obligations when such costs are\nprobabl\na e and reasonabl\na y estimabl\na e. Costs of estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value.\nRecoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is considered probabl\na e. The\naccrua\nr\nls are adju\nd sted as facts and circumstances change.\nStock-based compensation. Compensation cost is recognized using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the\naward and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. In accordance with amended ASC 718, the Company recognized $3.2\nmillion, $1.1 million, and $5.6 million of discrete income tax benefits on settled stock based compensation awards during\n2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively.\nIncome taxes. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, in accordance with ASC 740\nIncome Taxe\na\ns, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of\ntemporary\nr\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabi\na lities and for operating losses and tax\ncredit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabi\na lities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to\ntaxabl\na e income in effe\nf ct for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and are classified as\nnoncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the\namount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will\nbe sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits\nrecognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater\nthan 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement.\nEarnings per share of common stock. The Company is not required to use the two-class method of calculating earnings per\nshare since its Class A Common Stock and Common Stock have equal dividend rights. The numerator for the calculation of\nbasic and diluted earnings per share is net earnings. The following tabl\na e sets forth the computation of basic and diluted\nweighted-average shares used in the earnings per share calculations:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nDenominator for basic earnings per share - weighted-average shares\n149,952,679\n154,786,327\n159,906,834\nEffe\nf ct of dilutive stock options, restricted stock and share units\n1,062,895\n993,037\n1,413,068\nDenominator for diluted earnings per share\n151,015,574\n155,779,364\n161,319,902\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n740, Income Taxes (issued under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09, \u201cImp\nI\nrovements to Income Tax\na\nDisc\ni\nlosures\u201d). This ASU requires added disclosures related to the rate reconciliation, income taxes paid and other\namendments intended to improve effe\nf ctiveness and comparability. The amendment is effe\nf ctive for the Company beginning\nwith its 2025 annual disclosures with early adoption permitted and should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on its annual disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \u201cSegm\ne\nent Repor\ne\nting (Topi\nT\nc 280) - Impr\nm\novements to Repor\ne\ntable Segm\ne\nent\nDisc\ni\nlosures.\u201d The update is intended to improve reportabl\na e segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant expenses. The ASU requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM), a description of other segment items by reportabl\na e\nsegment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit\nf\nor loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate\nresources. The ASU also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods.\nThe update is effe\nf ctive for the Company beginning with its 2024 annual disclosures and interim periods beginning in 2025,\nwith early adoption permitted and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.\nThe Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have on its annual and interim\ndisclosures.\n2. Revenue Recognition\nSubs\nu\ntantially all of the Company\u2019s sales are from contracts with customers for the purchase of its products. Contracts and\ncustomer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of a sales contract. Shipping documents are used to verify\n1.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits\nThe Company provides retirement benefits for all U.S. employees including benefits for employees of previously owned\nbusinesses which were earned up to the date of sale. The Company also has two foreign pension plans, neither of which is\nmaterial to the Company\u2019s financial position.\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan which matches 100 percent of the first one percent of contributions made by\nparticipating employees and matches 50 percent of the next five percent of employee contributions. In addition, the Company\nhas defined contribution plans for certain hourly employees which provide for matching Company contributions.\nThe Company had a defined benefit plan for salaried employees and its non-union hourly workforce. In 2009, the Company\nannounced U.S. employees hired afte\nf r January 1, 2010, would not participate in the defined benefit plan, and benefit accrua\nr\nls\nfor the majo\na rity of current salaried and hourly employees sunset on December 31, 2014. An additional Company contribution\nis made to the defined contribution plan in lieu of benefits earned in a defined benefit plan. The Company also has defined\nbenefit and contribution plans for certain union hourly employees.\nIn 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the termination of the defined benefit pension plan (the Plan) with a\ntermination date of December 31, 2021. The Plan represented over 95 percent of the Company's pension plan liability. In\n2022, the Company received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that allowed the Company to\nproceed with the termination process. The Company settled approximately $169 million of Plan liabi\na lities through lump-sum\npayments from existing plan assets to eligible participants who elected to receive them and settled approximately\n$463 million of Plan liabilities by entering into an agreement to purchase annuities from Mass Mutual Life Insurance\nCompany (MML). The irrevocable agreement with MML covers approximately 7,000 active and former employees and their\nbeneficiaries, with MML assuming the future annuity payments for these individuals commencing March 1, 2023. These\nsettlements resulted in $417.3 million of pretax expense in 2022, partially offs\nf et by approximately $167.7 million in related\ntax benefits. In 2023, the Company realized pre-tax pension settlement income of $0.9 million, of which $0.7 million was\nrecorded in the North America segment and $0.2 million in Corporate Expense, and included $0.2 million in related tax\nbenefits. The pension settlement income related to refunds from MML to the Plan for the reconciliation of participant data\nand was partially offs\nf et by settlement accounting adju\nd stments. The remaining pension assets associated with the Plan at\nDecember 31, 2023 were $22.6 million. The Company intends to use the remaining assets to fund future non-elective\ncontributions to the Company\u2019s defined contribution plan.\nThe Company has unfunde\nf\nd defined-benefit post-retirement plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees that\nprovide medical and life insurance benefits from retirement to age 65. Certain hourly employees retiring afte\nf r January 1,\n1996, are subj\nu ect to a maximum annual benefit and salaried employees hired afte\nf r December 31, 1993, are not eligible for\npost-retirement medical benefits.\nObligations and Funded Status\nPension and Post-retirement Disclosure Information\nThe following tabl\na es present the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status\nt\nfor domestic pension and post-\nretirement plans and the components of net periodic benefit costs.\n12.

The Company\u2019s reserves for\nestimated losses under repurchase arrangements were immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nLegal\ne\nJudgment Income\nOn September 28, 2022, the Company received a cash judgment of $11.5 million from a competitor of our North America\nsegment related to its infringement of one of the Company\u2019s patents. The terms of the judgment resulted in pre-tax income of\n$11.5 million which is recorded as an offs\nf et to selling, general and administrative expenses and a related tax expense of\n$2.9 million.\n17. Operations by Segment\nThe Company is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. The Rest of World segment is\nprimarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufact\nf\nur\nt\ne and market comprehensive lines of residential\nand commercial gas and electric water heaters, boilers, tanks and water treatment products. Both segments primarily\nmanufact\nf\nur\nt\ne and market in their respective regions of the world.\nThe accounting policies of the reportabl\na e segments are the same as those described in the \u201cSummary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\u201d outlined in Note 1.

As a consequence, the prices we \nreceive for crude oil and our heavier liquid products move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it \nreacts to supply and demand factors. \nThe prices of our lighter liquid products move up and down independently of \nany relationship between the crude oil and natural gas markets. \nTransportation costs related to moving crude oil and \nliquids are also generally deducted from the price received for crude oil and liquids.\nOur natural gas is sold under both long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas \nproduced by us is sold at various delivery points to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated \nmidstream companies. \nThe prices we receive are calculated based on various pipeline indices. When there is an \nopportunity to do so, we may have our natural gas processed at San Mateo\u2019s, Pronto\u2019s or third parties\u2019 processing \nfacilities to extract liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas. We are then paid for the extracted NGLs based on \neither a negotiated percentage of the proceeds that are generated from the sale of NGLs or other negotiated pricing \narrangements using then-current market pricing less fixed rate processing, transportation and fractionation fees.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGL production fluctuate widely. Factors that, directly or \nindirectly, cause price fluctuations include, but are not limited to: the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand \nfor, oil, natural gas and NGLs; the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and certain \nother oil-exporting countries (\u201cOPEC+\u201d) and state-controlled oil companies; the prices and availability of competitors\u2019 \nsupplies of oil and natural gas; the price and quantity of foreign imports; the impact of U.S. dollar exchange rates; \ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts; \nthe availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, processing and transportation systems for oil, natural gas  \nand NGLs and gathering and disposal systems for produced water; the availability of refining capacity; the prices and \navailability of alternative fuel sources; weather conditions and natural disasters, including hurricanes and tropical \nstorms in the Gulf Coast region and severe cold weather in the Delaware Basin; political conditions or conflicts in or \naffecting oil and natural gas producing regions or countries, including the United States, the Middle East, South \nAmerica, Russia, Ukraine and China; the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and \n\n\n\t\n\t\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\t\n115    \n   FORM 10-K PART II \n\t\nYear Ended December 31,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n2023\t\n2022\t\n2021\n(In thousands)\nUnaudited Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation to Net Cash  \n\t\nProvided by Operating Activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n$\t\n1,867,828\t\n$\t\n1,978,739\t\n$\t\n1,053,355\nNet change in operating assets and liabilities\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t (50,027)\t\n\t 117,935\t\n\t\n982\nInterest expense, net of non-cash portion\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 114,473\t\n\t\n63,064\t\n\t\n71,028\nCurrent income tax provision\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n13,922\t\n\t\n54,877\t\n\t\n\u2014\nOther non-cash and non-recurring expense\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1,426\t\n\t\n9,543\t\n\t\n1,485\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest in subsidiaries\t \t\n\t\n\t (98,075)\t\n\t\n(97,002)\t\n\t (74,877)\n\t\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders\t\t\n$\t\n1,849,547\t\n$\t\n2,127,156\t\n$\t\n1,051,973\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we reported net income attributable to Matador shareholders of \n$846.1 million, as compared to $1.21 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. \nThis decrease primarily resulted \nfrom lower realized oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher oil and natural gas production, for the year \nended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

As of December 31, 2023, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and \ntransactions that we have entered into include (i) non-operated drilling commitments, (ii) firm gathering, transportation, \nprocessing, fractionation, sales and disposal commitments and (iii) contractual obligations for which the ultimate \nsettlement amounts are not fixed and determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes \nin commodity prices or interest rates, gathering, treating, transportation and disposal commitments on uncertain \nvolumes of future throughput, open delivery commitments and indemnification obligations following certain \ndivestitures. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, \narrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely  \nto materially affect our liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources.

Awards that are expected to be settled in cash are liability-based awards, which are measured at fair value \nat each reporting date and are recognized over the awards\u2019 vesting periods either as a component of general and \nadministrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income or capitalized in accordance with the Company\u2019s \npolicy on capitalizing general and administrative expenses for employees involved in acquisition, exploration, \ndevelopment and midstream activities.\nThe Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method to measure the fair value of performance units. \nThe \nclosing price of Matador\u2019s common stock on the grant date is used to measure the fair value of restricted stock and \nrestricted stock unit awards granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as subsequently amended and \nrestated, the \u201c2012 Incentive Plan\u201d), while the closing price of Matador\u2019s common stock on the trading day prior to \nthe grant date is used to measure the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted under  \nthe 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \u201c2019 Incentive Plan\u201d).\nNOTE 2 \u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \u2014 Continued\nFORM 10-K   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nF-16\t\nMATADOR RESOURCES COMPANY  \n\n\nThe current income tax provision and the deferred income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2023, \n2022 and 2021 were comprised of the following (in thousands).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nYear Ended December 31,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n2023\t\n2022\t\n2021\nCurrent income tax provision \n\t\nFederal income tax\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n$\t\n1,554\t\n$\t 31,335\t\n$\t\n\u2014\n\t\nState income tax\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 12,368\t\n\t 23,542\t\n\t\n\u2014\n\t\n\t Net current income tax provision\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n$\t 13,922\t\n$\t 54,877\t\n$\t\n\u2014\nDeferred income tax provision\n\t\nFederal income tax\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n$\t\n145,711\t\n$\t302,486\t\n$\t44,883\n\t\nState income tax\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 26,393\t\n\t 41,994\t\n\t29,827\n\t\n\t Net deferred income tax provision\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n$\t\n172,104\t\n$\t344,480\t\n$\t74,710\nReconciliations of the tax expense computed at the statutory federal rate to the Company\u2019s total income tax \nprovision for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in thousands).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nYear Ended December 31,\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n2023\t\n2022\t\n2021\nFederal tax expense at statutory rate(1)\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n$\t230,241\t\n$\t353,992\t\n$\t150,223\nState income tax expense \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 38,525\t\n\t 59,870\t\n\t 26,646\nPermanent differences\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n3,558\t\n\t\n(84)\t\n\t\n9,612\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t (13,500)\t\n\t(15,143)\t\n\t (11,690)\nTax credits generated\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n(109,368)\t\n\t\n\u2014\t\n\t\n\u2014\nReserve on uncertain tax positions\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t 35,336\t\n\t\n\u2014\t\n\t\n\u2014\nChange in federal valuation allowance\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u2014\t\n\t\n\u2014\t\n\t\n(103,262)\nChange in state valuation allowance\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1,234\t\n\t\n722\t\n\t\n3,181\n\t\nTotal income tax provision\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n$\t186,026\t\n$\t399,357\t\n$\t 74,710\n(1)\t The statutory federal tax rate was 21% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company files a United States federal income tax return and several state tax returns, a number of which \nremain open for examination. \nThe earliest tax year open for examination for the federal, the State of New Mexico  \nand the State of Louisiana tax returns is 2020. \nThe earliest tax year open for examination for the State of \nTexas tax \nreturn is 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits (\u201cUTB\u201d) of $35.3 million as a result  \nof research and experimental expenditures related to horizontal drilling and completion innovations, which would \nreduce the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in future periods if and when realized. \nThere were no UTBs as of \nDecember 31, 2022 or 2021.

GENERATING DIVERSE AND EFFICACIOUS HEALTH MESSAGES\nprompts with more phrases were harder to understand, perhaps, because they were ran-\ndomly grouped and are less semantically similar. P128 in Random(3) found that \u201cthese\n[phrases] were hard to combine since they deal with different aspects of exercise. Also the\nweight lifting seems to be not the best thing for addressing obesity, so that was hard to work\nin.\u201d\nFigure 3.11: Results of ideators\u2019 perceived prompt creativity (Top) and ideation effort (Bot-\ntom) for different Prompt Selection technique and Prompt Size. All factors values on a\n5-point Likert scale (\u20132 = \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d to 2 = \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d). Dotted lines in-\ndicate extremely significant p < .0001 comparisons, otherwise very significant with p-value\nstated; solid lines indicate no significance at p > .01. Error bars indicate 90% confidence\ninterval.\nWe found that ideation effort was mediated by prompt factors. Figure 3.11 (Bottom)\nshows that Directed prompts were least easy to use for ideation, and less adopted than Ran-\ndom selected prompts. This is consistent with Directed prompts being less understandable\nthan Random. Ideating with 1-phrase prompts increased ideation time from 44.1s by 21.6s\n(48.9%) compared to None, and viewing 3 phrase increased time further by 11.9s. In sum-\nmary, Directed Diversity may improve diversity by selecting unexpected prompts, but at\nsome cost of ideator effort and confusion. This cost compromises prompt adoption and sug-\ngests that directing diversity may not work. Yet, as we will show later, Directed Diversity\ndoes improve ideation creativity. We analyzed the confound of understandability further\nin Appendix Section A.11. Next, we investigate if prompts characteristics mediate more\nideation creativity.\nResults of Mediation Analysis of Diversity Propagation from Prompt to Ideation\n(RQ3.2c)\nWe found that prompt configuration and perceived prompt creativity mediated the individ-\nual diversity of ideated messages (RQ3.2b). Appendix Table A.29a (in) shows that Ideation\nMean (or Min) Pairwise Distance increased with Prompt Mean (or Min) Pairwise Distance by\n+0.176 (or +0.146), and marginally with Intra-Prompt Phrase Mean Distance by +0.021 (or\n+0.020). This means that farther Prompts stimulated farther Ideations, and higher variety\nof Phrases within each prompt drove slightly farther Ideations too. Hence, prompt diversity\n30\n\n\n3.5. EVALUATION: APPLYING FRAMEWORK TO STUDY DIRECTED DIVERSITY\n(mean pairwise distance) influenced ideation diversity, and prompt redundancy (minimum\npairwise distance) influenced ideation redundancy. Appendix Table A.29b shows that as\nPrompt Relevance decreased by one Likert unit (on 5-point scale), ideation mean pairwise\ndistance decreased by 0.0034 (7.9% of ideation pairwise distance SD of 0.043) and ideation\nminimum pairwise distance decreases by 0.0056 (13% of SD). This suggests that prompting\nwith irrelevant phrases slightly reduced diversity, since users had to have to conceive their\nown inspiration; e.g., P165 in Directed(1) \u201ccouldn\u2019t make sense of the given messages, so I\ntried my best to make something somewhat motivational and correct from them.\u201d. Prompt\nunderstandability and quality did not influence ideation individual diversity (p=n.s.). In\nsummary, selecting and presenting computationally diverse and less redundant prompts in-\ncreased the likelihood of crowdworkers ideating messages that are more computationally\ndiverse and less redundant.\nResults on Evaluating Individual, Collective Objective, Thematic Ideation Di-\nversity (RQ3.3)\nHaving shown the mediating effects of diverse prompts, we now evaluate how prompt selec-\ntion techniques affect self-assessed creativity ratings, objective diversity metrics of ideations,\nand thematically coded diversity metrics of ideations. To carefully distinguish between the\ncommonly used mean pairwise distance with the less used minimum pairwise distance, we\nperformed our analyses on them separately. We calculated one measurement of each col-\nlective diversity metric in Table 3.6 for all messages in each prompt selection condition,\nand computed uncertainty estimations from synthesized 50 bootstrap samples 7 to generate\n50 readings of each diversity metric. We performed factor analyses on the metrics as de-\nscribed in Section 3.4.3, and performed statistical analyses on these factors as described in\nAppendix Table A.30. Analyses on both individual diversity and collective diversity mea-\nsures had congruent results (Figure 3.12), though results for collective diversity had more\nsignificant differences (p < .001). For collective diversity, our factor analysis found that\nIdeation Dispersion was most correlated with mean pairwise distance, and Ideation Even-\nness with entropy and mean of Chamfer distance. Directed(3) improved Ideation Dispersion\nfrom None, while Random reduced Dispersion (even more for 3 vs. 1 phrases). Directed\nprompts improved Ideation Evenness more than Random with respect to None. There was\nno significant difference for self-assessed Ideation Quality (p=n.s., Table A.31a in Appendix).\nFigure 3.12: Results of computed individual and collective diversity from ideations for dif-\nferent prompt configurations.

RISK FACTORS\n\u00a0\nAn investment in our securities may be considered speculative and involves a high degree of risk, including, among other items, the risk factors\ndescribed below. These\u00a0risk factors are intended to generally describe certain risks that could materially affect the Company and its business operations\nand activities.\n\u00a0\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and elsewhere herein in connection with any decision\u00a0 to acquire, hold or sell the\nCompany\u2019s securities. The following list identifies and briefly summarizes certain risks but should not be viewed as complete or comprehensive. If any of\nthe contingencies discussed in the following paragraphs\u00a0or other materially adverse events\u00a0actually occur, the business, financial condition of the business\nand its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline\u00a0and you could\nlose all or a significant part of your investment.\n\u00a0\nLiquidity and Debt Risks\n\u00a0\nAn inability to borrow from our new receivables financing\u00a0during our peak work periods would have a negative impact on our business and liquidity.\n\u00a0\nIn March 2022, we refinanced\u00a0$13.8 million of outstanding debt under our 2017 Amended Credit Facility with East West Bank for\u00a0$8.4 million in\ncash plus future unsecured\u00a0payments of up to $1.0 million. Prior to the Refinancing of our debt with East West Bank,\u00a0our growth was limited because of\nour inability to borrow under our line of credit with East West Bank to meet working capital requirements during our\u00a0peak demand periods during the\nwinter months.\u00a0Our ability to grow and sustain our business in the future will depend upon our ability to be able to regularly borrow under our Receivables\nFinancing\u00a0(the \u201cReceivables Financing\u201d), as defined in Note 5\u00a0- Debt to the consolidated financials statements. There is no assurance that we will be able to\nmake future borrowings under lines of credit, including our Receivables Financing, in order to fund our operations\u00a0during peak demand periods. If we are\nunable to generate or obtain the requisite amount of financing needed to fund our business operations or execute our growth strategy, our liquidity and\nability to continue operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\u00a0\nWe continue to have significant debt obligations that are subject to interest rate increases.\n\u00a0\nWe have significant debt obligations under our 2022 equipment lease facility with Utica Leaseco, LLC (the \u201cEquipment Financing\u201d and\ncollectively with the Receivable Financing, the \u201c2022 Financing Facilities\u201d), with current minimum monthly payments to Utica Leaseco, LLC of $204,000\nas of January 1, 2024, which is subject to twice yearly Prime Rate dependent interest rate increases, as further\u00a0described in Note 5\u00a0- Debt to the\nconsolidated financial\u00a0statements.\n\u00a0\nOur ability to pay interest and principal payments on our\u00a0Equipment Financing, and to satisfy our other debt obligations,\u00a0as described in Note 5\u00a0-\nDebt to the consolidated financial\u00a0statements, will depend upon our ability to achieve increased utilization of our equipment, which is highly influenced by\nweather and customers' drilling activity.\u00a0We cannot reasonably guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future\ncapital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to fund our future liquidity needs. In the absence of adequate cash from operations and/or other\navailable capital resources\u00a0we could face substantial liquidity constraints.\u00a0To the extent that we could not repay or refinance our indebtedness when due, or\ngenerate adequate cash flows from operations, we may have to curtail operations which would adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe cannot reasonably guarantee\u00a0that we will be able to raise sufficient capital through debt or equity financings on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that\nwe could consummate dispositions of assets or operations for fair market value, in a timely manner or at all.\n\u00a0\nWe are currently in a difficult operating environment\u00a0and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be affected by general\neconomic conditions and other factors beyond\u00a0our control.\n\u00a0\nWe face a\u00a0difficult operating environment with oil and gas exploration and production companies\u00a0exerting significant pressure on us to reduce our\nprices for the services we provide. Reduced activity and operating margins could force us\u00a0 to curtail operations in some or all our locations which\nwould\u00a0materially and adversely affect our revenues and our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\u00a0\nGeneral economic conditions, weather, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors may also affect our operations and our\nfuture performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. The\u00a0Company\u00a0experienced a heavy downturn in demand for our services in early 2020,\nwhich continued throughout\u00a02021. While crude oil prices and demand for services rebounded\u00a0in 2022, demand for our services still remained below pre-\npandemic levels throughout the course of 2023.\u00a0If\u00a0we do\u00a0not have sufficient funds on hand to continue to pay our monthly debt when due, we may be\nrequired to seek a waiver or amendment from our lender, refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, or sell additional shares of\nour common stock. We may not be able to complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our\ndebts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u00a0\nWe have operated at a loss, and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\n\u00a0\nWe have experienced periods of low demand for our services and have incurred operating losses. Although there have been improvements in\ndemand in recent periods, we are still operating at a loss and in an accumulated deficit position. Demand for services in the oil and natural gas industry is\ncyclical and has experienced significant downturns in recent years, which have significantly affected the performance of our business. Additional adverse\ndevelopments affecting this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able\nto sufficiently reduce our costs or increase our revenues to achieve profitability and generate positive operating income. We may incur further operating\nlosses and experience negative operating cash flow, which may be significant. As a result of this history of losses, and combined with other factors,\u00a0the\nCompany believes that\u00a0substantial doubt exists over our ability to continue as a going concern from one year after the date of issuance of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\n\u00a0\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAcquisition and Operations Related Risks\n\u00a0\nWhile our growth strategy includes exploring potential acquisitions of other oilfield or other diversified services companies not directly in the oil sector,\nwe may not be successful in identifying, making and integrating business or asset acquisitions, if any, in the future.\n\u00a0\nWe anticipate that a component of our growth strategy may be to make strategically\u00a0 focused acquisitions of businesses or assets aimed to\nstrengthen our presence and expand services offered in selected service\u00a0markets.\u00a0Additionally, we believe that the diversification of our business outside of\nthe oil\u00a0and gas services\u00a0industry will be important in achieving\u00a0our long-term growth strategy. Pursuit of this strategy may be restricted by the on-going\nvolatility and uncertainty within the credit markets which may significantly limit the availability of funds for such acquisitions. Our ability to use shares of\nour common stock in an acquisition transaction,\u00a0whether as merger consideration or for raising capital, may be adversely affected by the volatility in the\nprice of our common stock\u00a0and by the potential requirement of shareholder approval.\n\u00a0\nIn addition to restricted funding availability, the success of this strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to\nnegotiate acceptable financial and other terms. There is no assurance that we will be able to do so. The success of an acquisition also depends on our ability\nto perform adequate due diligence before the acquisition and on our ability to integrate the acquisition after it is completed. While we intend to commit\nsignificant resources to ensure that we conduct\u00a0 comprehensive due diligence, there can be no assurance that all potential risks and liabilities will be\nidentified in connection with an acquisition. Similarly, while we expect to commit substantial resources, including management time and effort, to\nintegrating acquired businesses into ours, there is no assurance that we will be successful in integrating these businesses. In particular, it may be\u00a0important\nthat we are\u00a0able to retain both key personnel of the acquired business and its customer base. A loss of either key personnel or customers could negatively\nimpact the future operating results of any acquired business.\n\u00a0\nOur business is\u00a0substantially impacted by seasonality and\u00a0weather conditions.\n\u00a0\nOur operations, particularly our frac heating services, are impacted by weather conditions and temperatures. Unseasonably warm weather during\nwinter months\u00a0reduces demand for our frac\u00a0heating services and results in higher operating costs, as a percentage of revenue, due to the need to retain\nequipment operators during these low demand periods.\u00a0Management makes concerted efforts to reduce time and costs during these low demand periods by\nutilizing operators in other business segments, reducing hours, and in some instances, utilizing seasonal layoffs.\n\u00a0\nFurther, during the winter months, our customers may delay operations or we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations\nduring periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, and during the spring some areas impose transportation restrictions due to muddy conditions caused by spring\nthaws.\n\u00a0\nWe may be unable to implement price increases.\n\u00a0\nWe periodically seek to increase the prices of our services to offset rising costs and to generate increased revenues.\u00a0 We operate in a very\ncompetitive industry and, as a result, we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased\nmarket demand, a significant amount of new equipment may enter the market, which would also put pressure on the pricing of our services. Even when we\nare able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset rising costs. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase\nprices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our prices or to increase the prices of our services in order to offset rising\ncosts\u00a0could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\u00a0We anticipate pricing pressure impacting our other\nservice lines to the extent that oil and gas prices drop.\n\u00a0\nWe operate in a capital-intensive industry and may not be able to finance future growth of our operations or future acquisitions.\n\u00a0\nOur business activities require substantial capital expenditures. If our cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings are not\nsufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we would be required to reduce these expenditures or to fund these expenditures through new debt or\nequity issuances.\n\u00a0\nOur ability to raise new debt or equity capital, or to refinance or restructure our debt, at any given time depends on, among other things, the\ncondition of the capital markets, our financial condition, and the oil and gas industry market outlook\u00a0at such time. Also, the terms of existing or future debt\nor equity instruments could further restrict our business operations. The inability to finance future growth could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00a0\nIncreased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers could adversely affect\u00a0our operations.\n\u00a0\nCompanies in our industry, including us, are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled workers. We compete with other oilfield services\nbusinesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide our customers with the\nhighest quality service. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working\nconditions, and which can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. A shortage\u00a0of skilled workers or other general inflationary\npressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain skilled personnel and could require us to\nenhance our wage and benefits packages. Labor costs may increase in the future, or we may not be able to reduce wages when demand and pricing falls,\nand such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00a0\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u00a0\nWe have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Stockholders may not receive funds without selling their shares.\n\u00a0\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if\nany, to pay down debt and finance the expansion of our business. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors (\"Board\")\nand will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and investment opportunities.\nAccordingly, realization of a gain on a shareholder\u2019s investment will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock.\n\u00a0\nOur Board of Directors\u00a0can, without stockholder approval, cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that adversely affect holders of our common\nstock.\n\u00a0\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our Board\u00a0is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which none are issued and\noutstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. Also, our Board, without stockholder approval, may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges\nand restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares. If our Board\u00a0causes shares of preferred stock to be issued, the rights of the holders of our common\nstock would likely be subordinate to those of preferred holders and therefore could be adversely affected. Our Board\u2019s ability to determine the terms of\npreferred stock and to cause its issuance, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could\nhave the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Preferred shares issued by our\nBoard\u00a0 could include voting rights or super voting rights, which could shift the ability to control the Company to the holders of the preferred stock.\nPreferred stock could also have conversion rights into shares of our common stock at a discount to the market price of our common stock, which could\nnegatively affect the market for our common stock. In addition, preferred stock would have preference in the event of liquidation of the corporation, which\nmeans that the holders of preferred stock would be entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation distributed in liquidation before the holders of our\ncommon stock receive any distribution of the liquidated assets.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile regardless of our operating performance\u00a0and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock\nat or above the price you paid, or at all.\n\u00a0\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile, and a stockholder may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which such\nstockholder paid for such shares. Our stock price volatility can be in response to a number of factors, including those listed in this section and elsewhere in\nthis Annual Report. As a company in the oil services sector, there can be significant trading volume and volatility in our common stock that may be\nunrelated to our operating performance and more related to fluctuations and trading in oil-related public companies as a whole. Many of these volatility\nfactors are beyond our control. Other factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cfActual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfLiquidity;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfOur inability to raise capital;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfSales of our common stock by us or\u00a0our stockholders;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfFluctuations and higher trading volume related to being in the oil services sector;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfChanges in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfChanges in our cash flow from operations or earnings estimates;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfPublication of research reports about us or the oil and natural gas exploration, production and service industry,\u00a0generally;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfCompetition from other oil and gas service companies and for, among other things, capital and skilled personnel;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfIncreases in market interest rates which may increase our cost of capital;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfChanges in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings, and enforcement and legal actions;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfChanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfAdverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfAdditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfActions by our stockholders;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfCommencement of or outcome of any significant\u00a0litigation;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfNews reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes, and other related issues in our industry;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfSpeculation in the press or investment community regarding our business;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfPolitical conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions;\n\u00a0\n\u25cfGeneral market and economic conditions;\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u25cfDomestic and international economic, legal, and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u00a0\n\u25cfOur ability to comply with NYSE American continued listing standards.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn addition, the United States\u00a0securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over the past several years. These\nfluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Market fluctuations and broad market, economic and\nindustry factors may negatively affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Any volatility or a significant decrease in\nthe market price of our common stock could also negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions using our common stock. Further, if we were to be the\nobject of securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in our common stock price or for other reasons, it could result in substantial costs and\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our financial results.\n\u00a0\n15\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Which section of the document contains information about the company's approach to managing risks related to market fluctuations, and on what page can this information be found?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/675a6484936f1e502e3d793483d86d84.png"]}

Experiments\n69\n3.4.1\nMNIST Experiments\nSince MNIST is relatively small compared to ImageNet, we trained several classifiers\nwith various architectures and complexities and implemented the adversarial attacks\ndirectly. Adversarial examples were generated against each of these models using\nIterative Gradient Sign Method (IGSM (Kurakin, Goodfellow, and Bengio, 2016))\nand Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal,\n1989)).\nInvestigation of (\u03b3, \u03c3)-Stability on MNIST\nWe begin with a fully connected ReLU network with layers of size 784, 100, 20,\nand 10 and small regularization \u03bb = 10\u22127 which is trained on the standard MNIST\ntraining set. We then start with a randomly selected MNIST test image x1 from the\n1\u2019s class and generate adversarial examples x0, x2, . . . , x9 using IGSM for each target\nclass other than 1. The neighborhoods around each xi are examined by generating\n1000 i.i.d. samples from N(xi, \u03c32I) for each of 100 equally spaced standard deviations\n\u03c3 \u2208(0, 1.6). Figure 3.2 shows the results of the Gaussian perturbations of a natural\nexample x1 of the class labeled 1 and the results of Gaussian perturbations of the\nadversarial example x0 targeted at the class labeled 0. We provide other examples of\nx2, . . . , x9 in the supplementary materials. Note that the original image is very stable\nunder perturbation, while the adversarial image is not.\nPersistence of Adversarial Examples for MNIST\nTo study persistence of adversarial examples on MNIST, we take the same network\narchitecture as in the previous subsection and randomly select 200 MNIST images.\n\n\n3.4. Experiments\n71\nNext, we investigate the relationship of network complexity and (\u03b3, \u03c3)-stability by\nrevisiting the now classic work of Szegedy et al. (2014) on adversarial examples.\nTable 3.1 recreates and adds on to part of Szegedy et al., 2014, Table 1 in\nwhich networks of differing complexity are trained and attacked using L-BFGS. The\ntable contains new columns showing the average 0.7-persistence for both natural\nand adversarial examples for each network, as well as the average distortion for the\nadversarial examples. The distortion is the \u21132-norm divided by square root of the\ndimension n. The first networks listed are of the form FC10-k, and are fully connected\nsingle layer ReLU networks that map each input vector x \u2208I\nR784 to an output vector\ny \u2208I\nR10 with a regularization added to the objective function of the form \u03bb \u2225w\u22252 /N,\nwhere \u03bb = 10\u2212k and N is the number of parameters in the weight vector w defining\nthe network. The higher values of \u03bb indicate more regularization.\nFC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10 are fully connected networks with 2 hidden layers\n(with 100 and 200 nodes, respectively) with regularization added for each layer of\nperceptrons with the \u03bb for each layer equal to 10\u22125, 10\u22125, and 10\u22126. Training for\nthese networks was conducted with a fixed number of epochs (typically 21). For the\nbottom half of Table 3.1, we also considered networks with four convolutional layers\nplus a max-pooling layer connected by ReLU to a fully connected hidden layer with\nincreasing numbers of channels denoted as as \u201cC-Ch,\u201d where C reflects that this is a\nCNN and Ch denotes the number of channels. A more detailed description of these\nnetworks can be found in Appendix B.3.\nThe main observation from Table 3.1 is that for higher complexity networks,\nadversarial examples tend to have smaller persistence than natural examples.

Once there are sufficiently many parameters available in the neural\nnetwork, we found that both the average distortion of the adversarial examples and\nthe average 0.7-persistence of the adversarial examples tended to be smaller. This\nobservation is consistent with the idea that networks with more parameters are more\nlikely to exhibit decision boundaries with more curvature.\n\n\n156\nAppendix B. Persistence Tools\nhigh. It should be noted that these high-distortion attacks against models with few\neffective parameters were inherently very stable \u2013 resulting in most of the \u201cadversarial\u201d\nimages in these sets having higher persistence than natural images. This suggests a\nlack of the sharp conical regions which appear to characterize adversarial examples\ngenerated against more complicated models.

{"query": "<image>Context:\n\n8\nOverview and Industry Outlook\nWe continue to monitor the current global economic environment, specifically including inflationary pressures and the\nmacroeconomic impact of the conflict in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, and any resulting impacts on our financial position and results of\noperations. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nBoth the market for drilling and production equipment and services and the Company\u2019s business are substantially dependent on\nthe condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on\nexploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view\nof future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including\nworldwide economic activity, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulation, tax policies and the ability and/or desire\nof OPEC+ and other producing nations to set and maintain production levels and prices.\nDuring 2023, crude oil prices fluctuated, with a high of $97.10 per barrel and a low of $71.03 per barrel. According to the January\n2024 release of the Short-Term Energy Outlook published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of\nEnergy, Brent crude oil prices averaged approximately $82.49 per barrel in 2023, and the price is forecasted to average $82.49 per barrel\nin 2024 and $79.48 per barrel in 2025. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas\nmay cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of products and services, or reduce their levels of\ncapital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons.\nThe volatility in Brent crude oil prices over the past four years continues to have an effect on major integrated, large independent\nand foreign national oil and gas companies\u2019 capital expenditure budgets. Capital expenditures are also dependent on the cost of exploring\nfor and producing oil and gas, the availability, expiration date and price of leases and rigs, the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves,\nand technological advances. Oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by\nsignificant volatility. Future declines in oil and gas prices may further adversely affect the willingness of some oil and gas companies\nto make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations, financial position and cash flows. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014A material or extended decline in expenditures by\nthe oil and gas industry could significantly reduce our revenue and income.\u201d\nAs the energy industry prepares for a transition, Dril-Quip is actively pursuing opportunities to engage with customers that are\nworking in the areas of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and geothermal energy. Each of these industries align well with\nthe Company\u2019s core capabilities and expertise and also provides us with an avenue to expand our offerings. We see a healthy project\npipeline developing and are actively engaging with customers to explore how we leverage our products and position to help them\nnavigate through the energy transition.\nBrent crude oil prices per barrel for the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 are summarized below:\nBrent Crude Oil Prices\n2023\n2022\n2021\nHigh\n$\n97.10\n$\n133.18\n$\n85.76\nLow\n$\n71.03\n$\n76.02\n$\n50.37\nAverage\n$\n82.49\n$\n100.94\n$\n70.86\nClosing as of December 31,\n$\n77.69\n$\n82.82\n$\n77.24\nIn its January 2024 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA reported United States crude oil production averaged an estimated\n12.9 million barrels per day in 2023 and is forecasted to average 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024.\nProducts and Services\nDril-Quip\u2019s revenues are generated from three sources: products, services and leasing. Product revenues are derived from the sale\nof drilling and production equipment. Service revenues are earned when the Company provides technical advisory assistance, equipment\ninstallation and monitoring, rework, reconditioning and repair services. Leasing revenues are derived from rental tools used during\ninstallation and retrieval of the Company\u2019s products. In 2023, the Company derived 63.9% of its revenues from the sale of its products,\n24.9% of its revenues from services and 11.2% from leasing revenues, compared to 66.5%, 21.9% and 11.6% for products, services and\nleasing in 2022, respectively, and 66.1%, 23.0% and 10.9% for products, services and leasing in 2021, respectively. Service and leasing\nrevenues generally correlate to revenues from product sales because increased product sales typically generate increased demand for\ntechnical advisory assistance services during installation and rental of running tools. However, existing customer equipment can be used\nin certain circumstances, which creates demand for services with no correlating product sales. The Company has substantial international\noperations, with approximately 74.9% of its revenues derived from foreign sales in 2023, 66.2% in 2022 and 63.8% in 2021.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s domestic revenue relates to operations in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico. Domestic revenue approximated\n25.1% of the Company\u2019s total revenues in 2023, 33.8% in 2022 and 36.2% in 2021. Revenue is based on the location where services\nare provided and products are sold.\n\n\n11\nManufacturing\nDril-Quip has manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Aberdeen, Scotland; Singapore; Macae, Brazil; and Edmonton, Canada.\nSee \u201cItem 2. Properties\u2014Manufacturing Facilities.\u201d Dril-Quip maintains its high standards of product quality through the use of quality\ncontrol specialists and implementation of continuous improvement methodologies. These continuous improvement methodologies\nleverage Lean practices and focus on improving processes with the goal of providing world-class quality, delivery and service to our\ncustomers at the highest possible value.\nThe Company\u2019s Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore, and Macae manufacturing plants are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 9001\ncertified. The Edmonton manufacturing plant is ISO 9001 certified. The Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore, and Macae plants are also\nlicensed to applicable American Petroleum Institute (API) product specifications and are API Q1, 9th edition and API Q2 compliant.\nThe Edmonton plant is licensed to API 6A product specifications and is API Q1 compliant. Dril-Quip works to maintain its high\nstandards of product quality through the use of precision measuring equipment such as MRP gages, Faro Arms, Coordinate Measuring\nMachine and the application of Lean practices. The Company has the capability to manufacture its products globally and continues to\nhave local capability in key critical markets. The Company\u2019s primary raw material is forged steel products which it procures from\nqualified forging suppliers located globally as well as domestically.\nDril-Quip\u2019s manufacturing facilities utilize state-of-the-art computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools and equipment,\nwhich contribute to the Company\u2019s product quality and timely delivery. The Company has made significant investments for a complete\nupgrade of its manufacturing of subsea wellheads with the latest equipment and technology.\nCustomers\nThe Company\u2019s principal customers are major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies. Drilling\ncontractors and engineering and construction companies also represent a portion of the Company\u2019s customer base. The Company\u2019s\ncustomers are generally oil and gas companies that are well-known participants in exploration and production.\nThe Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers. In 2023, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented\napproximately 59% of total revenues, and Chevron Corporation and its affiliated companies (\u201cChevron\u201d) accounted for approximately\n11% of total revenues. In 2022, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented approximately 60% of total revenues, and Chevron\naccounted for approximately 10% of total revenues. In 2021, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented approximately 59% of total\nrevenue, and Chevron accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total\nrevenues in 2023, 2022 or 2021. The number and variety of the Company\u2019s products required in a given year by any one customer\ndepends upon the amount of that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget devoted to exploration and production, the availability of rigs\nand floating production storage and offloading (FSPO) units, and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a\ncustomer that accounts for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in\nsubsequent years. While the Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of its\nsignificant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nBacklog\nBacklog consists of firm customer orders of Dril-Quip products for which a purchase order, signed contract or letter of award has\nbeen received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled. The Company\u2019s backlog primarily consists\nof our Subsea products. Historically, the Company\u2019s revenues for a specific period have not been directly related to its backlog as stated\nat a particular point in time. The Company\u2019s product backlog was approximately $262.8 million and $240.9 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The backlog at the end of 2023 represents an increase of approximately $21.9 million, or 9.1%, from the\nend of 2022. The Company\u2019s backlog balance was positively impacted during 2023 as our product bookings increased primarily due to\nimprovement in market conditions, the addition of Great North bookings, and a decrease in cancelations compared to 2022.\nThe Company expects to fill approximately 70% to 80% of the December 31, 2023 product backlog by December 31, 2024. The\nremaining backlog at December 31, 2023 consists of longer-term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer\nspecifications requiring longer lead times.\nSee \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain\nindicator of our future revenues and earnings.\u201d\nMarketing and Sales\nDril-Quip has a multifaceted approach to marketing and sales to effectively promote its products and services globally. Utilizing\ndigital marketing channels and its direct sales personnel across diverse domestic and international locations, the Company strives for\ndirect and personalized engagement with clients.\nIn certain foreign markets the Company utilizes independent sales agents or representatives to enhance its marketing and sales\nefforts. Some of the locations in which Dril-Quip has sales agents or representatives are Trinidad, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kuwait, Vietnam,\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Although they do not have authority to contractually bind the Company, these\nrepresentatives market the Company\u2019s products in their respective territories in return for sales commissions.\n\n\n12\nDril-Quip also has integrated digital and web-based strategies into its marketing initiatives, recognizing the evolving landscape of\nthe sales cycle. Dril-Quip\u2019s official website serves as a central hub, offering comprehensive information about products and services,\ncomplemented by a strategic presence on social media platforms. The Company enhances its visibility and industry awareness by\nparticipating in virtual and industry conferences and trade shows and utilizes digital channels for targeted marketing and advertising.\nThis digital integration complements traditional sales efforts, for a holistic approach to international market promotion of the Company\u2019s\nproducts and services.\nThe Company\u2019s customers generally order products on a purchase order basis. Orders, other than those considered to be long-term\nprojects, are typically filled within twelve months after receipt, depending on the type of product and whether it is sold out of inventory\nor requires some customization. Contracts for certain of the Company\u2019s larger, more complex products, such as subsea production trees\ncan take a year or more to complete.\nIncreasingly, customers enter into long-term contracts (generally three years or more) with the Company covering the purchase of\ngoods and services. These long-term contracts generally specify the products and services, the standard terms of the agreement and often\ntimes the price of the goods and services to be purchased. Purchase orders that reference this long-term agreement are then issued by\nthe customer to the Company for specific quantities of the goods and services. The customer order is not included in backlog or bookings\nuntil after a purchase order is obtained.\nThe primary factors influencing a customer\u2019s decision to purchase the Company\u2019s products are the quality, reliability and\nreputation of the product, price, technology, service and timely delivery. For large drilling and production system orders, project\nmanagement teams coordinate customer needs with the Company\u2019s engineering, manufacturing and service organizations, as well as\nwith subcontractors and vendors.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s business consists of designing, manufacturing and selling equipment, as well as offering technical\nadvisory assistance during installation of the equipment, for major projects pursuant to competitive bids. The number of such projects\nin any year may fluctuate. The Company\u2019s profitability on such projects is critically dependent on making accurate and cost-effective\nbids and performing efficiently in accordance with bid specifications. Various factors, including availability of raw materials, changes\nin customer requirements and governmental regulations, can adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance on individual projects, with\npotential material adverse effects on project profitability.\nProduct Development and Engineering\nThe technological demands of the oil and gas industry continue to increase as exploration and drilling expand into more hostile\nenvironments. Conditions encountered in these environments include water depths in excess of 10,000 feet, well pressures up to\n20,000 psi, well flowing temperatures beyond 350 degrees Fahrenheit and mixed flows of oil, gas and water that may also be highly\ncorrosive and impact material properties.\nSince its founding in 1981, Dril-Quip has actively engaged in continuing research and development efforts to generate new\nproducts and improve existing products. When developing new products, the Company typically seeks to design the most technologically\nadvanced version for a particular application to establish its reputation and qualification in that product. Thereafter, the Company\nleverages its expertise in the more technologically advanced product to produce less costly and complex versions of the product for less\ndemanding applications. The Company also focuses its activities on reducing the overall cost to the customer, which includes not only\nthe initial capital cost but also operating, installation and maintenance costs associated with its products in an effort to help reduce\ncustomers\u2019 carbon footprint.\nDril-Quip\u2019s product development work is primarily conducted at its facilities in Houston, Texas. Our Houston facility comprises\n~35,000 ft2 of best-in-class testing capacity supplemented by industry leading engineering capability. This allows us to fully test and\nqualify our designs to meet the needs of our customers. In addition to this capability, the Company\u2019s application engineering staff\nprovides technical services to customers in connection with the design and sales of its products. The Company\u2019s ability to develop new\nproducts and maintain technological advantages is important to its future success. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Our business could be\nadversely affected if we do not develop new products and secure and retain patents related to our products.\u201d\nSome notable examples of our Product Development successes are as follows:\n\u2022\nThe XPak De liner hanger, which provides our customers with both a replacement and an improvement to industry standard\nsub-mudline supplemental hanger systems. This product successfully passed field trials in 2021 and continues to be a focus\nof our product development efforts in order to access other geographies such as Brazil, Guyana and the continental USA.\n\u2022\nDXe hydraulic connectors were successfully developed and installed in the Norwegian North Sea, utilizing our patented\nDXe profile.\n\u2022\nDril-Quip continues to see successful installations of our Horizontal Subsea Tree (HXT) which utilizes our \u2018e\u2019 series\ntechnologies which fundamentally reduce cost of ownership for our customers as well as addresses a significant reduction\nin Carbon Footprint due to efficiency of installation.\n\n\n13\n\u2022\nOur fully designed, tested and qualified high pressure subsea wellhead technology (SS-20) for 20k applications also\ncontinues to gain adoption as operators look for new discoveries across the globe.\n\u2022\nDril-Quip successfully designed, tested and qualified wellhead systems against arduous customer specifications and\nbecoming the 1st company globally to pass these enhanced specifications.\nDril-Quip is also embracing the Energy Transition and aligning its core capabilities in the areas of Product Development and\nEngineering towards markets focused on Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and Geothermal Energy. Our ability to\ndevelop products to suit different operating parameters will position us well for future market opportunities.\nThe Company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing\nabilities of its employees than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of its ongoing product development\nand manufacturing activities, Dril-Quip\u2019s policy has been to seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and\nproduct improvements. All patent rights for products developed by employees are assigned to the Company and almost all of the\nCompany\u2019s products have components that are covered by patents.\nDril-Quip has numerous U.S. registered trademarks, including Dril-Quip\u00ae, Quik-Thread\u00ae, Quik-Stab\u00ae, Multi-Thread\u00ae, MS-\n15\u00ae, SS-15\u00ae, SS-10\u00ae, SU-90\u00ae, DX\u00ae and TIW\u00ae. The Company has registered its trademarks in the countries where such registration\nis deemed material.\nAlthough in the aggregate, the Company\u2019s patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacturing and\nmarketing of many of its products, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks to\nbe material to its business as a whole, except the Dril-Quip\u00ae trademark. The Company also relies on trade secret protection for its\nconfidential and proprietary information. The Company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and\nsuppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to\nthe Company\u2019s trade secrets.\nDril-Quip will continue to strive for technological excellence and is well positioned to succeed across multiple sectors in the\ncoming years. Our strong foundational product developments provide a solid platform for our future.\nCompetition\nDril-Quip faces significant competition from other manufacturers and suppliers of exploration and production equipment. Several\nof its primary competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources\nthan those of the Company and which, in many instances, have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer period\nof time than the Company. The Company competes principally with the petroleum production equipment segments of Baker Hughes;\nSchlumberger, Ltd.; TechnipFMC plc; and Aker Solutions.\nBecause of their relative size and diversity of products, several of the Company\u2019s competitors have the ability to provide \u201cturnkey\u201d\nservices for drilling and production applications, which enables them to use their own products to the exclusion of Dril-Quip\u2019s products.\nSee \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling and production\nequipment.\u201d The Company also competes to a lesser extent with a number of other companies in various products. The principal\ncompetitive factors in the petroleum drilling and production equipment markets are quality, reliability and reputation of the product,\nprice, technology, service and timely delivery.\nTalent and Human Capital Management\nOur people are the key to achieving our vision, and nurturing a transparent, collaborative and development focused culture drives\nalignment with our business strategy to achieve sustainable long-term shareholder value. We believe that building a diverse, inclusive\nculture helps build an engaged and empowered workforce to manage our business with a focus on health and safety, the environment,\nethical behavior, quality and being a good corporate citizen in all countries in which we operate. We aim to attract and retain the right\ntalent with the competencies and motivation required to execute our business strategy. Our global human capital strategy drives a\nconsistent approach to people development and provides tools to facilitate employee development. Performance management and\nleadership succession are a key part of our people development process that helps identify and develop future leadership talent. Our\nboard provides oversight to the leadership succession process to review our human capital analytics on workforce demographics,\ndiversity and inclusion, hiring and attrition rates and succession readiness. These metrics are tracked, and progress is measured at\ncascading levels of the organization.\n\n\n20\nItem 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn this Item 1A., the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cDril-Quip\u201d used herein refer to Dril-Quip, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless\notherwise indicated or as the context so requires.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Social and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d)\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters may impact our business.\nWe may not be able to adequately identify or manage ESG-related risks and opportunities, which may include failing to achieve\nESG-related strategies and goals. Also, despite these aspirational goals, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders or other groups\nto adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals\nbecause of changes in activity levels, potential costs or technical or operational obstacles. In addition, organizations that provide\ninformation to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on\ntheir approach to ESG matters. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of sustainability\nevaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their\ninvestment and voting decisions. Additionally, certain investors use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a\ncompany is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance.\nMoreover, certain members of the broader investment community may consider a company\u2019s sustainability score as a reputational or\nother factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our stock from\nconsideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our\noperations by certain investors.\nWe are subject to compliance with governmental regulations associated with climate change, energy conservation\nmeasures, or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy that could result in increased costs, limit the areas\nin which our clients\u2019 oil and natural gas production may occur and reduced demand for our services, which may adversely affect\nour business and results of operations.\nInvestor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, and consumer demand for alternative forms of energy\nmay result in increased costs, reduced demand for our services, reduced profits, increased risks of governmental investigations and\nprivate party litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Our managerial ESG Steering Team is\nthe primary group for overseeing and managing our ESG initiatives. Team members review the implementation and effectiveness of our\nESG programs and policies and report on these matters to the Board of Directors. While we have sought voluntary aspirational goals for\nGHG emission reductions from base year 2018, we note that even with our governance oversight in place, we may not be able to\nadequately identify or manage ESG-related risks and opportunities, which may include failing to achieve ESG-related aspirational goals.\nWe have published voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters under an annual Sustainability Report and the Global Reporting\nInitiative, an international independent standards organization.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with respect to our\nESG policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Investor advocacy groups, certain\ninstitutional investors, investment funds, lenders and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent\nyears have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. The increased focus and activism\nrelated to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors and lenders may decide to reallocate capital or not to\ncommit capital as a result of their assessment of a company\u2019s ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor,\nlender or other industry shareholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded\nappropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from\nreputational damage and the business, financial condition or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate\nchange, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. As a result, we may be required\nto implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us\nand make further investments in us, especially given the specific business of providing drilling and production equipment for oil and\ngas exploration in which we are engaged. If we do not meet these standards, our business or our ability to access capital could be harmed.\nAdditionally, certain investors and lenders have and may continue to exclude companies engaged in drilling and production\nactivity, such as us, from their investing portfolios altogether due to ESG factors. These limitations in both the debt and equity capital\nmarkets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing those markets. If those markets are unavailable,\nor if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business\nstrategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service\nour indebtedness.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: How might the geopolitical factors discussed in the \"Business Environment\" section impact Dril-Quip's future strategic decisions and partnerships, particularly in the context of its CCUS collaboration?", "response": "", "images": ["data/qwen_images/f9c3176edccd252a8688f16d53345991.png"]}

{"query": "Context:\n\nCHAPTER 6. IMPROVING PERFORMANCE PREDICTION IN MULTIPLE ENVIRONMEN\n6.1.1\nKnowledge Gap\nAs demonstrated in Chapter 3, a majority of studies only assume a static en-\nvironment when learning the performance model for configurable software. The\nfailure to take multiple environments into account not only degrades accuracy but\nalso incurs an extra overhead of model re-building, as the valuable data samples\nmeasured under different environments are wasted. This leads to a previously un-\naddressed problem: How to effectively leverage configurations measured in different\nenvironments for modeling configuration performance? Yet, learning a perform-\nance model under multiple environments for configurable software is challenging\ndue to the large variations between data measured in distinct environments. For\nexample, several studies have revealed that varying environments can cause sub-\nstantial changes in the performance distributions with non-monotonic correlations,\nincluding workloads (M\u00a8\nuhlbauer et al. 2023, Chen 2022b, Pereira et al. 2020), ver-\nsions (Martin et al. 2022) and hardware (Jamshidi, Siegmund, Velez, K\u00a8\nastner,\nPatel & Agarwal 2017).\nDespite being uncommon, M\u00a8\nuhlbauer et al. (2023) summarized two major cat-\negories from existing work on how multiple environments have been handled, each\nwith its own limitations:\n1. Environment as additional features (Chen & Bahsoon 2017a, Koc\net al. 2021, Lengauer et al. 2014, Chen 2019): Here, the specific\nproperties of an environment, e.g., size and job counts, are considered as\nmodel features alongside the configuration options in performance model\nlearning. However, in this category, not only the additional measurements\ncan be costly, but the extra dimension(s) also make the true concept more\ndifficult to learn and generalize.\n2. Transfer learning (Jamshidi, Velez, K\u00a8\nastner, Siegmund & Kawthekar\n2017, Krishna et al. 2021, Martin et al. 2022, Valov et al. 2017):\nGiven an existing performance model trained in the source environment(s),\nits differences to the new environment can be learned via transfer learn-\ning models. Yet, the key shortcoming thereof is that the loss function in\ntransfer learning is tailored to a specific target environment, hence lacking\ngeneralizability to arbitrary environments.\nThe above motivates this thesis to explore the concept of meta-learning, which\ntries to learn the way of learning. To be specific, a meta-model is trained using\nseveral meta-tasks, which learns the best parameters to quickly fit new tasks,\nwithout any prior knowledge of the new task.\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n194\nas a one-bit difference in the model. Therefore, the distribution of the data\nsamples can be intrinsically different from the other domains.\nTherefore, this thesis is one of the earliest ones in the literature to conduct an\nempirical study on the influence of encoding schemes for machine and deep per-\nformance models. Most importantly, this work demonstrates the importance and\nexpansiveness of choosing the encoding scheme, and provides an in-depth analysis\nof the influence of encoding schemes, together with insights and suggestions under\ndifferent circumstances.\n7.2.3\nA State-of-the-art Performance Model for\nAddressing Sparsity in Performance Learning\nIn the existing literature on performance prediction, a variety of approaches have\nbeen utilized, including analytical models, traditional data-driven models, en-\nsemble learning frameworks, and emergent deep learning models. Yet, a novel\nmodel DaL that leverages the concept of \u201cdivide-and-learn\u201d and deep learning\nis proposed in this thesis, which remarkably addresses the sparsity issues and\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy as shown in Chapter 5. However, there is a lack\nof comprehensive analysis and discussion over the current literature.\nTo bridge this gap, this section introduces the existing performance models,\nand discusses the advantages of DaL over them.\nAnalytical models\nPredicting software performance can be done by analyzing the code structure and\narchitecture of the systems (Di Marco & Inverardi 2004, Velez et al. 2021). For\nexample, Di Marco & Inverardi (2004) apply queuing network to model the latency\nof requests processed by the software. Velez et al. (2021) use local measurements\nand dynamic taint analysis to build a model that can predict performance for part\nof the configuration code.\nHowever, analytical models require full understanding and access to the soft-\nware\u2019s internal states, which may not always be possible/feasible. Further, due\nto the theoretical assumption or limitations of the measurement tool, analytical\nmodels are often restricted to certain performance metrics, most commonly time-\nrelated ones such as runtime and latency. DaL is not restricted to those scenarios\nas it is a data-driven approach while still being designed to cater to the unique\nsparse nature of configuration data.\n\n\nCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n195\nStatistical learning-based models\nData-driven learning has relied on various statistical models, such as linear re-\ngressions (Siegmund, Rosenm\u00a8\nuller, Kuhlemann, K\u00a8\nastner, Apel & Saake 2012,\nSiegmund et al. 2015, Sun et al. 2020, Kang et al. 2020), tree-liked model (Hsu\net al. 2018, Sarkar et al. 2015, Nair, Yu, Menzies, Siegmund & Apel 2018),\nfourier-learning models (Zhang et al. 2015, Ha & Zhang 2019b), and even transfer\nlearning (Jamshidi et al. 2018, Krishna et al. 2021, Jamshidi, Siegmund, Velez,\nK\u00a8\nastner, Patel & Agarwal 2017), etc. Among others, SPLConqueror (Siegmund,\nRosenm\u00a8\nuller, Kuhlemann, K\u00a8\nastner, Apel & Saake 2012) utilizes linear regression\ncombined with different sampling methods and a step-wise feature selection to cap-\nture the interactions between configuration options. DECART (Guo et al. 2018) is an\nimproved CART with an efficient sampling method (Zhang et al. 2015). Jamshidi\n& Casale (2016) use Gaussian Process (GP) to model configuration performance,\nwhich is also gradually updated via Bayesian Optimization. However, recent work\nreveals that those approaches do not work well with small datasets (Ha & Zhang\n2019a), which is rather common for configurable software systems due to their\nexpensive measurements. This is a consequence of not fully handling the sparsity\nin configuration data. Further, they come with various restrictions and prerequis-\nites, e.g., DECART does not work on mixed systems while SPLConqueror needs an\nextensive selection of the right sampling method(s); GP has also been proved to\nstruggle in modeling the sparse configuration data (Nair, Yu, Menzies, Siegmund\n& Apel 2018).\nIn contrast, it is shown that DaL produces significantly more accurate results\nwhile not limited to those restrictions. In addition, the paradigm of dividable\nlearning underpins DaL prevent it from suffering the particular pitfalls of a single\nmachine learning algorithm, as it can be paired with different local models.\nDeep learning-based models\nA variety of studies apply deep neural networks with multiple layers to predict\nconfiguration performance (Ha & Zhang 2019a, Shu et al. 2020, Nemirovsky et al.\n2017, Sohail et al. 2021, Falch & Elster 2017, Kim et al. 2017, Marathe et al.\n2017, Johnsson et al. 2019, Zhang et al. 2018). Among others, HINNPerf uses\nembedding to encodes the configuration into a latent space after which a deep\nneural network, combined with the hierarchical regularization, is applied to handle\nfeature sparsity. DeepPerf (Ha & Zhang 2019a) is a state-of-the-art DNN model\nwith \ud835\udc3f1 regularization to mitigate feature sparsity for any configurable systems,\nand it can be more accurate than many other existing approaches.\nThe most\nrecently proposed Perf-AL (Shu et al. 2020) relied on adversarial learning that\n\n\nREFERENCES\n225\nlearning models, in \u20182015 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing,\nCLUSTER\u2019, pp. 128\u2013137.\nJackson, E. & Agrawal, R.

{"query": "<image><image>Context:\n\n8\nOverview and Industry Outlook\nWe continue to monitor the current global economic environment, specifically including inflationary pressures and the\nmacroeconomic impact of the conflict in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, and any resulting impacts on our financial position and results of\noperations. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nBoth the market for drilling and production equipment and services and the Company\u2019s business are substantially dependent on\nthe condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on\nexploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view\nof future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including\nworldwide economic activity, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulation, tax policies and the ability and/or desire\nof OPEC+ and other producing nations to set and maintain production levels and prices.\nDuring 2023, crude oil prices fluctuated, with a high of $97.10 per barrel and a low of $71.03 per barrel. According to the January\n2024 release of the Short-Term Energy Outlook published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of\nEnergy, Brent crude oil prices averaged approximately $82.49 per barrel in 2023, and the price is forecasted to average $82.49 per barrel\nin 2024 and $79.48 per barrel in 2025. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas\nmay cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of products and services, or reduce their levels of\ncapital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons.\nThe volatility in Brent crude oil prices over the past four years continues to have an effect on major integrated, large independent\nand foreign national oil and gas companies\u2019 capital expenditure budgets. Capital expenditures are also dependent on the cost of exploring\nfor and producing oil and gas, the availability, expiration date and price of leases and rigs, the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves,\nand technological advances. Oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by\nsignificant volatility. Future declines in oil and gas prices may further adversely affect the willingness of some oil and gas companies\nto make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s\nresults of operations, financial position and cash flows. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014A material or extended decline in expenditures by\nthe oil and gas industry could significantly reduce our revenue and income.\u201d\nAs the energy industry prepares for a transition, Dril-Quip is actively pursuing opportunities to engage with customers that are\nworking in the areas of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and geothermal energy. Each of these industries align well with\nthe Company\u2019s core capabilities and expertise and also provides us with an avenue to expand our offerings. We see a healthy project\npipeline developing and are actively engaging with customers to explore how we leverage our products and position to help them\nnavigate through the energy transition.\nBrent crude oil prices per barrel for the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 are summarized below:\nBrent Crude Oil Prices\n2023\n2022\n2021\nHigh\n$\n97.10\n$\n133.18\n$\n85.76\nLow\n$\n71.03\n$\n76.02\n$\n50.37\nAverage\n$\n82.49\n$\n100.94\n$\n70.86\nClosing as of December 31,\n$\n77.69\n$\n82.82\n$\n77.24\nIn its January 2024 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA reported United States crude oil production averaged an estimated\n12.9 million barrels per day in 2023 and is forecasted to average 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024.\nProducts and Services\nDril-Quip\u2019s revenues are generated from three sources: products, services and leasing. Product revenues are derived from the sale\nof drilling and production equipment. Service revenues are earned when the Company provides technical advisory assistance, equipment\ninstallation and monitoring, rework, reconditioning and repair services. Leasing revenues are derived from rental tools used during\ninstallation and retrieval of the Company\u2019s products. In 2023, the Company derived 63.9% of its revenues from the sale of its products,\n24.9% of its revenues from services and 11.2% from leasing revenues, compared to 66.5%, 21.9% and 11.6% for products, services and\nleasing in 2022, respectively, and 66.1%, 23.0% and 10.9% for products, services and leasing in 2021, respectively. Service and leasing\nrevenues generally correlate to revenues from product sales because increased product sales typically generate increased demand for\ntechnical advisory assistance services during installation and rental of running tools. However, existing customer equipment can be used\nin certain circumstances, which creates demand for services with no correlating product sales. The Company has substantial international\noperations, with approximately 74.9% of its revenues derived from foreign sales in 2023, 66.2% in 2022 and 63.8% in 2021.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s domestic revenue relates to operations in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico. Domestic revenue approximated\n25.1% of the Company\u2019s total revenues in 2023, 33.8% in 2022 and 36.2% in 2021. Revenue is based on the location where services\nare provided and products are sold.\n\n\n11\nManufacturing\nDril-Quip has manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Aberdeen, Scotland; Singapore; Macae, Brazil; and Edmonton, Canada.\nSee \u201cItem 2. Properties\u2014Manufacturing Facilities.\u201d Dril-Quip maintains its high standards of product quality through the use of quality\ncontrol specialists and implementation of continuous improvement methodologies. These continuous improvement methodologies\nleverage Lean practices and focus on improving processes with the goal of providing world-class quality, delivery and service to our\ncustomers at the highest possible value.\nThe Company\u2019s Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore, and Macae manufacturing plants are ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ISO 9001\ncertified. The Edmonton manufacturing plant is ISO 9001 certified. The Houston, Aberdeen, Singapore, and Macae plants are also\nlicensed to applicable American Petroleum Institute (API) product specifications and are API Q1, 9th edition and API Q2 compliant.\nThe Edmonton plant is licensed to API 6A product specifications and is API Q1 compliant. Dril-Quip works to maintain its high\nstandards of product quality through the use of precision measuring equipment such as MRP gages, Faro Arms, Coordinate Measuring\nMachine and the application of Lean practices. The Company has the capability to manufacture its products globally and continues to\nhave local capability in key critical markets. The Company\u2019s primary raw material is forged steel products which it procures from\nqualified forging suppliers located globally as well as domestically.\nDril-Quip\u2019s manufacturing facilities utilize state-of-the-art computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools and equipment,\nwhich contribute to the Company\u2019s product quality and timely delivery. The Company has made significant investments for a complete\nupgrade of its manufacturing of subsea wellheads with the latest equipment and technology.\nCustomers\nThe Company\u2019s principal customers are major integrated, large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies. Drilling\ncontractors and engineering and construction companies also represent a portion of the Company\u2019s customer base. The Company\u2019s\ncustomers are generally oil and gas companies that are well-known participants in exploration and production.\nThe Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers. In 2023, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented\napproximately 59% of total revenues, and Chevron Corporation and its affiliated companies (\u201cChevron\u201d) accounted for approximately\n11% of total revenues. In 2022, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented approximately 60% of total revenues, and Chevron\naccounted for approximately 10% of total revenues. In 2021, the Company\u2019s top 15 customers represented approximately 59% of total\nrevenue, and Chevron accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total\nrevenues in 2023, 2022 or 2021. The number and variety of the Company\u2019s products required in a given year by any one customer\ndepends upon the amount of that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget devoted to exploration and production, the availability of rigs\nand floating production storage and offloading (FSPO) units, and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a\ncustomer that accounts for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in\nsubsequent years. While the Company is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of its\nsignificant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nBacklog\nBacklog consists of firm customer orders of Dril-Quip products for which a purchase order, signed contract or letter of award has\nbeen received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled. The Company\u2019s backlog primarily consists\nof our Subsea products. Historically, the Company\u2019s revenues for a specific period have not been directly related to its backlog as stated\nat a particular point in time. The Company\u2019s product backlog was approximately $262.8 million and $240.9 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The backlog at the end of 2023 represents an increase of approximately $21.9 million, or 9.1%, from the\nend of 2022. The Company\u2019s backlog balance was positively impacted during 2023 as our product bookings increased primarily due to\nimprovement in market conditions, the addition of Great North bookings, and a decrease in cancelations compared to 2022.\nThe Company expects to fill approximately 70% to 80% of the December 31, 2023 product backlog by December 31, 2024. The\nremaining backlog at December 31, 2023 consists of longer-term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer\nspecifications requiring longer lead times.\nSee \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain\nindicator of our future revenues and earnings.\u201d\nMarketing and Sales\nDril-Quip has a multifaceted approach to marketing and sales to effectively promote its products and services globally. Utilizing\ndigital marketing channels and its direct sales personnel across diverse domestic and international locations, the Company strives for\ndirect and personalized engagement with clients.\nIn certain foreign markets the Company utilizes independent sales agents or representatives to enhance its marketing and sales\nefforts. Some of the locations in which Dril-Quip has sales agents or representatives are Trinidad, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kuwait, Vietnam,\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Although they do not have authority to contractually bind the Company, these\nrepresentatives market the Company\u2019s products in their respective territories in return for sales commissions.\n\n\n13\n\u2022\nOur fully designed, tested and qualified high pressure subsea wellhead technology (SS-20) for 20k applications also\ncontinues to gain adoption as operators look for new discoveries across the globe.\n\u2022\nDril-Quip successfully designed, tested and qualified wellhead systems against arduous customer specifications and\nbecoming the 1st company globally to pass these enhanced specifications.\nDril-Quip is also embracing the Energy Transition and aligning its core capabilities in the areas of Product Development and\nEngineering towards markets focused on Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) and Geothermal Energy. Our ability to\ndevelop products to suit different operating parameters will position us well for future market opportunities.\nThe Company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing\nabilities of its employees than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of its ongoing product development\nand manufacturing activities, Dril-Quip\u2019s policy has been to seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and\nproduct improvements. All patent rights for products developed by employees are assigned to the Company and almost all of the\nCompany\u2019s products have components that are covered by patents.\nDril-Quip has numerous U.S. registered trademarks, including Dril-Quip\u00ae, Quik-Thread\u00ae, Quik-Stab\u00ae, Multi-Thread\u00ae, MS-\n15\u00ae, SS-15\u00ae, SS-10\u00ae, SU-90\u00ae, DX\u00ae and TIW\u00ae. The Company has registered its trademarks in the countries where such registration\nis deemed material.\nAlthough in the aggregate, the Company\u2019s patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacturing and\nmarketing of many of its products, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks to\nbe material to its business as a whole, except the Dril-Quip\u00ae trademark. The Company also relies on trade secret protection for its\nconfidential and proprietary information. The Company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and\nsuppliers. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently obtain similar information or otherwise gain access to\nthe Company\u2019s trade secrets.\nDril-Quip will continue to strive for technological excellence and is well positioned to succeed across multiple sectors in the\ncoming years. Our strong foundational product developments provide a solid platform for our future.\nCompetition\nDril-Quip faces significant competition from other manufacturers and suppliers of exploration and production equipment. Several\nof its primary competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources\nthan those of the Company and which, in many instances, have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer period\nof time than the Company. The Company competes principally with the petroleum production equipment segments of Baker Hughes;\nSchlumberger, Ltd.; TechnipFMC plc; and Aker Solutions.\nBecause of their relative size and diversity of products, several of the Company\u2019s competitors have the ability to provide \u201cturnkey\u201d\nservices for drilling and production applications, which enables them to use their own products to the exclusion of Dril-Quip\u2019s products.\nSee \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling and production\nequipment.\u201d The Company also competes to a lesser extent with a number of other companies in various products. The principal\ncompetitive factors in the petroleum drilling and production equipment markets are quality, reliability and reputation of the product,\nprice, technology, service and timely delivery.\nTalent and Human Capital Management\nOur people are the key to achieving our vision, and nurturing a transparent, collaborative and development focused culture drives\nalignment with our business strategy to achieve sustainable long-term shareholder value. We believe that building a diverse, inclusive\nculture helps build an engaged and empowered workforce to manage our business with a focus on health and safety, the environment,\nethical behavior, quality and being a good corporate citizen in all countries in which we operate. We aim to attract and retain the right\ntalent with the competencies and motivation required to execute our business strategy. Our global human capital strategy drives a\nconsistent approach to people development and provides tools to facilitate employee development. Performance management and\nleadership succession are a key part of our people development process that helps identify and develop future leadership talent. Our\nboard provides oversight to the leadership succession process to review our human capital analytics on workforce demographics,\ndiversity and inclusion, hiring and attrition rates and succession readiness. These metrics are tracked, and progress is measured at\ncascading levels of the organization.\n\n\n36\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock to the cumulative total shareholder\nreturn on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Stock Index, a broad stock index, and the VanEck Oil Services ETF Index (\u201cOIH\u201d), an index of oil\nand natural gas related companies that represents an industry composite of peers.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Great North from its\nassessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase\nbusiness combination during 2023. We have also excluded Great North from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Great\nNorth is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting represent 11% and 8%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as\nof and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\n\n\nAnswer the following question in 200 words or less: Compare the performance trends of Dril-Quip, Inc., the S&P 500, and the VanEck OIH Index from 2018 to 2023.

Quantitive Results\nComparison with Baseline MPC: In this step, the objective is to ana-\nlyze how the navigation performance evolves with an increase in batch size.\nFor comparison, I establish the MPC setting with a batch size of one as the\nbaseline and subsequently increase the number of batches. It is important\nto note that any off-the-shelf optimizer can be employed in this comparison.\nI tried to use ACADO optimizer [39], but it could not achieve reliable and\nreal-time performance for the provided benchmarks.\nTable 2 presents our results. Notably, the MPC baseline exhibits a very\nlow success rate, approximately one percent. However, with an increase in\nthe number of batches, our success rate experiences a gradual ascent and\nreaches to 97% success rate for 1000 batches. Additionally, a slight increase\nin tracking error and acceleration is observed, attributed to the necessity for\nour optimizer to take detours in order to furnish a collision-free trajectory.\nComparison with CEM: I present the pivotal results of our paper by\ncomparing our optimizer with the SOTA, CEM, in an MPC setting in Table\n3. To make the comparison, I consider 8k samples (8 times of the number of\nour samples) and heavily vectorized the cost evaluations in CEM. Through\ntrial and error, I obtained the number of iterations of CEM that can be\nperformed within 0.04s (the computation time of our MPC).\n65\n\n\nTable 2.

Furthermore, our average tracking error is 43% lower\nthan CEM on the same benchmark. For Benchmark 2 and Benchmark\n3, our optimizer\u2019s success rates are 20% and 45% higher than CEM, re-\nspectively. Similarly, our tracking error remains lower than CEM on these\nbenchmarks.\nNotably, the CEM method generally deploys less accelera-\ntion on average compared to our proposed method. This arises from our\nmethod\u2019s dual focus on minimizing acceleration and addressing the need to\nnavigate obstacles while following the desired trajectory. In more challeng-\ning scenarios, our method may utilize more acceleration to yield feasible\ntrajectories, contributing to a higher success rate.\nComputation Time Scaling:\nFigure 28 visually presents the per-\niteration computation time scaling of our batch optimizer for varying num-\nbers of circles and obstacles. Notably, the plot indicates a (sub)linear scaling\nof per-iteration computation time in relation to the number of circles and\nobstacles. This trend can be attributed to the matrix algebra employed in\nour optimizer. Specifically, a linear increase in the number of footprint cir-\ncles or obstacles leads to a similar increase in the number of rows of matrices\nF and gi, while the number of columns remains constant. Consequently, the\ncomputation cost of obtaining FT gi in (5.19) can be made approximately\nlinear through suitable GPU parallelization. Also, the matrices FT F need\nto be computed only once since they remain constant across iterations and\nbatches. A similar linear complexity analysis applies to the solutions of\n(5.14) as well, where solutions are available as symbolic formulae, ensuring\nlinear complexity concerning the variables nc and no.\nAdditionally, I assess the per-iteration computation time of our vector-\nized batch optimizer across GPUs and multi-threaded CPUs in Table. 4.\n66\n\n\nFigure 28. Time per iteration(ms) for batch size 1000. Solutions are typically\nobtained within 5 \u221210 iterations. The figure presents the scaling with respect\nto the number of circles used to approximate the footprint of the robot and the\nnumber of obstacles in the environment.\nTable 4.

However, CPU parallelization introduces a sce-\nnario where each problem instantiation competes with others for compu-\ntational resources, potentially slowing down the overall computation time.\nOur experiments revealed that a C++ version of our optimizer performed\nsmoothly with a batch size of 5, achieving a per-iteration computation time\nof 0.0015s, which was competitive with our GPU implementation. Never-\ntheless, scaling beyond this batch size resulted in a significant slowdown.\nFor instance, with a batch size of 6, the per-iteration CPU time increased\nto 0.03s. Hence, for larger batch sizes, it became more practical to run se-\nquential instantiations with mini-batches of 5. I note that a more rigorous\nimplementation might improve batch equality-constrained QP structure in\nsome critical steps in the performance of multi-threaded CPU-based batch\noptimization. However, our current bench-marking establishes the compu-\ntational benefit derived from several layers of reformulation that induced\nequality-constrained QP structure in some critical steps of our batch opti-\nmizer and allowed for effortless GPU acceleration.\n67\n\n\nof k\u03bei (see analysis of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 in Sections 4.3 and 5.6).\nNote that for each AM step, I only optimize one group of variables while\nothers are held fixed.\nGPU Accelerated Batch Operation: The proposed method involves\nprojecting multiple sampled trajectories onto the feasible set (see Figure30).\nHowever, as mentioned before, performing these projections sequentially can\nbe computationally burdensome. Fortunately, my projection optimizer ex-\nhibits certain structures conducive to batch and parallelized operations. To\ndelve into this concept, consider the matrix M in (6.5a), which remains\nconstant regardless of the input trajectory sample \u03bei. In essence, M re-\nmains unchanged irrespective of the specific trajectory sample requiring\nprojection onto the feasible set. This characteristic enables us to express\nthe solution (6.5a) for all trajectory samples \u03bei, i = 1, 2, . . . , Nb as a single\nlarge matrix-vector product. This computation can be effortlessly paral-\nlelized across GPUs. Similarly, acceleration is attainable for the function h,\nwhich primarily involves element-wise products and sums. This allows for\nefficient parallelization and leveraging GPU capabilities to enhance overall\nperformance.\nScalability: The matrix M in (6.5a) requires a one-time computation, as\nA and F remain constant throughout the projection iteration. Conversely,\nthe matrix \u03b7 is recalculated at each iteration, with its computational cost\nprimarily dominated by FT k+1ei. The number of rows in both F and e\nincreases linearly with the planning horizon, the number of obstacles, or\nthe batch size. This characteristic, in conjunction with GPU acceleration,\nshows my approach with remarkable scalability for long-horizon planning in\nhighly cluttered environments. Figure 31 presents the average per-iteration\ntime of the projection optimizer. It also demonstrates how it scales with\nthe number of obstacles and batch size.\nFigure 31. Scalability of per-iteration computation time of my projection opti-\nmizer to number of obstacles and batch size\n75\n\n\nFigure 41. Comparisons with SOTA [34] in terms of arc-length and smoothness\ncost\nComparison with [106]: Figure 42 shows the most important results of\nthis study, where I compare the proposed optimizer with the current SOTA\nmethod, [106]. The cited work adopts a sequential approach but with a\nbatch of agents. It also leverages the parallel QP-solving ability of CPLEX\n[109] on multi-core CPUs. My optimizer provides trajectories with compa-\nrable smoothness to [106] but with significantly shorter arc lengths. This\ntrend can be attributed to the reduced feasible space accessible to a sequen-\ntial approach. Additionally, the proposed optimizer surpasses [106] in terms\nof computation time for 16 and 32 agent benchmarks while achieving compa-\nrable performance on the 64 agent benchmark. It is crucial to contextualize\nthese timings by acknowledging that the proposed optimizer conducts a\nmuch more exhaustive search than [106] across the joint trajectory space of\nthe agents. The trends in computation time can be explained as follows:\nfor a smaller number of agents, the computation time of [106] is primar-\nily influenced by the trajectory initialization derived from sampling-based\nplanners. Additionally, the overhead of CPU parallelization is substantial\nfor fewer agents, but this overhead is offset by the computational speed-up\nattained for a larger number of agents.\nPerformance on Jetson TX2: Table 11 displays the computation time\nfor varying numbers of agents in the square benchmark conducted on the\nNvidia Jetson TX2 platform.

(Reproduced from\n[73], licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).)\nImproving on the maximum entropy principle\nOne of the relations in Theorem 3.5 exemplifies that we can improve on the\nmaximum entropy principle. In particular, combining it with Proposition 3.1, we\nhave that injective optimization principles exist for preorders with a countable\nmulti-utility. Hence, there are functions that (up to equivalence) preserve the\nuniqueness property of the maximum entropy principle for any subset of P\u2126.\nMoreover, applying [73, Proposition 11 (ii)], such functions yield maxima when\noptimized over any compact set, in particular, over a linear subset of P\u2126. Hence,\nthese functions allow us to (essentially) preserve the desirable properties of the\nmaximum entropy principle for any bound that defines a compact subset of P\u2126.\n(Note that Shannon entropy does not possess this uniqueness property on any\ncompact set, as we showed in [73, Lemma 4 (ii)].)\n72\n\n\nAppendix A.1). In other words, we can construct an injective map g : \u00f00; log N\u00de !\nIH and thus IH has the same cardinality as R, in particular IH is not countable.\n4 Relating monotones to optimization\nAn element x 2 X is called a maximal element of \u0003 if there exists no y 2 X such that\nx \u0005 y. For any B \f X, an element x 2 B is called a maximal element of \u0003 in B if\nthere exists no y 2 B such that x \u0005 y.\nDefinition 2\n(Representing maximal elements) We say, a function f : X ! R is\neffective\nfor\nB \f X\nif\nargmaxB f 6\u00bc ;,\nwhere\nargmaxB f:\u00bcfx 2 Bj 6 9y 2\nB such that f\u00f0x\u00de\\f\u00f0y\u00deg. We say, a function f : X !

Similarly, we say, a\nfunction f injectively represents maximal elements of \u0003, if for any B \f X for which f\nis effective, there exists x0 2 B\u0003\nM such that\nargmaxBf \u00bc \u00bdx0\u0007jB\nwhere \u00bdx0\u0007jB is the equivalence class of x0 restricted to B. Moreover, we say, \u00f0X; \u0003\u00de\nhas an (injective) optimization principle if there exists a function f : X ! R which\n(injectively) represents maximal elements of \u0003.\nEven though Shannon entropy does not represent \u0003U as a utility, its property as a\nstrict monotone guarantees that its maxima are in fact maximal elements of \u0003U, i.e.,\nH\nrepresents\nmaximal\nelements\nof\nthe\nuncertainty\npreorder\naccording\nto\nDe\ufb01nition 2. Indeed, any p 2 argmaxBH is a maximal element of \u0003U for any B \f\nPX on which H is effective, as p \u0005 q for some q 2 B would lead to the contradiction\nH\u00f0q\u00de [ H\u00f0p\u00de. In fact, representing maximal elements is closely related to being a\nmonotone for preorders in general.\nProposition 3\nGiven a preordered space \u00f0X; \u0003\u00de and a monotone u : X ! R, then\n(i)\nu is a strict monotone if and only if u represents maximal elements of \u0003.\n(ii)\nu is an injective monotone if and only if u injectively represents maximal\nelements of \u0003.\nProof\n(i)\nIf u is a strict monotone, then argmaxBu \f B\u0003\nM (by the same argument as for\nentropy). Conversely, consider x; y 2 X with x \u0005 y. For B:\u00bcfx; yg, we have\nB\u0003\nM \u00bc fyg and thus fyg \u00bc argmaxBu, i.e., u\u00f0x\u00de\\u\u00f0y\u00de.\n123\nRepresenting preorders with injective monotones\n669\n\n\n(ii)\nFor any B \f X on which u is effective, if x, y 2 argmaxBu, we have u\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc\nu\u00f0y\u00de and, since u is an injective monotone, x \b y. Conversely, consider x; y 2\nX\nand\nB :\u00bc fx; yg.\nIf\nu\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc u\u00f0y\u00de\nthen\nby\nhypothesis\nfx; yg \u00bc\nargmaxx2Bfu\u00f0x\u00deg \u00bc \u00bdx0\u0007jB for some x0 2 B. In particular, x \b y.\nh\nNotice, for the \u2018\u2018if\u2019\u2019 part in (ii), we do not have to assume that u is a monotone,\nthat is, if the maxima of some real-valued function u form an equivalence class in\nthe set of maximal elements, then it already follows that u is a monotone.\nFor any preordered space \u00f0X; \u0003\u00de, thus, the existence of a strict monotone\nimplies the existence of an optimization principle and the existence of an injective\nmonotone is equivalent to the existence of an injective optimization principle. One\ncan contrast the global injective representation of maximal elements which\ncharacterizes injective monotones in Proposition 3 with local approaches, for\nsome speci\ufb01c B \f X, present in the literature (Bevilacqua et al., 2018b; White,\n1980).\nChoosing a particular strict monotone u and optimizing it in a set B might,\nhowever, not yield all the maximal elements in B\u0003\nM. For example, take p; q 2 PX\nwith p \ufb04q and H\u00f0p\u00de\\H\u00f0q\u00de, then B \u00bc fp; qg has the two maximal elements p and\nq, but argmaxB H \u00bc fpg. Notice, this is not only an issue for trivial examples like\nthis, but also happens for the maximum entropy principle with linear constraint sets.\nIn particular, if B \u00bc fp j hEi \u00bc cg, for a given random variable E and some c 2 R,\ncrosses two incomparable elements that turn out to be maximal (see Fig. 2), then\nonly part of the actual maximal elements of \u0003U can be found by maximizing\nentropy.\nSimilarly, while optimizing an injective monotone in a set B results in equivalent\nelements, in general, we only \ufb01nd a slice of the set of all maximal elements in B. In\nfact, for every maximal element x in B\u0003\nM, we can construct an injective monotone c\nsuch that x 2 argmax c (e.g., in the proof of Proposition 4 below, take cx if x 2 Ac\nand c otherwise). This means that the problem of selecting a maximal equivalence\nclass can be replaced by the problem of selecting an injective monotone.\nIn the following section, we show that injective monotones exist for a large class\nof preorders, including the uncertainty preorder.\n5 Relating monotones to multi-utilities\nAlthough it is not possible to capture all information about a non-total preorder\nusing a single real-valued function, a family of functions may be used instead. A\nfamily V of real-valued functions v : X ! R is called a multi-utility (representation)\nof \u0003 if\nx \u0003 y (\n) v\u00f0x\u00de \u0004 v\u00f0y\u00de 8v 2 V :\nWhenever a multi-utility consists of strict monotones, it is called a strict monotone\n(or Richter\u2013Peleg Alcantud et al., 2016) multi-utility (representation) of \u0003.\n123\n670\nP. Hack et al.\n\n\nAnalogously, if the multi-utility consists of injective monotones, we call it an\ninjective monotone multi-utility (representation) of \u0003.\nIt is straightforward to see that every preordered space \u00f0X; \u0003\u00de has the multi-\nutility \u00f0vi\u00f0x\u00de\u00dex2X, where vA denotes the characteristic function of a set A and\ni\u00f0x\u00de:\u00bcfy 2 Xjx \u0003 yg (Ok, 2002). Moreover, if there exists a strict monotone u, then\na multi-utility U only consisting of strict monotones can easily be constructed from\na given multi-utility V by U:\u00bcfv \u00fe augv2V;a [ 0 (Alcantud et al., 2013). Even\nthough this construction does not work directly in the case of injective monotones, a\nsimple modi\ufb01cation does, where special care is given to incomparable elements.\nProposition 4\nLet \u00f0X; \u0003\u00de be a preordered space.

In particular, there are p; q 2 PX with c \u00bc H\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc H\u00f0q\u00de\nbut p \ufb04q for all c 2 \u00f00; log jXj\u00de.\nProof\n(i)\nStrict monotonicity of H comes from the fact H\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc PjX\ni\u00bc1 f\u00f0pi\u00de where\nf\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u0006x log\u00f0x\u00de is a strictly convex function. Given any other strictly con-\nvex f, strict monotonicity will still hold. One can \ufb01nd the details in (Marshall\net al., 1979, C.1.a). H is not an injective monotone for jXj \n 3 by (ii).\n(ii)\nGiven p; q 2 PX, we denote by pq the segment with endpoints p, q. Consider\nu 2 PX the uniform distribution, ei; ej 2 PX Dirac distributions for two dif-\nferent elements i; j 2 X and some c 2\n\u0005\n0; log jXj\n\u0006\n. Consider some c0 s.t.\n0\\c0\\minfc; H\u00f0m\u00deg where m is the middle point of eiej. By the interme-\ndiate value theorem, there exists some r 2 eim such that H\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc c0. Consider\nnow a parametrization of eir: frtgt2\u00bd0;1\u0007 and de\ufb01ne \u2018t:\u00bcrtu for each t 2 \u00bd0; 1\u0007.\nAgain by the intermediate value theorem, since H\u00f0rt\u00de\\c 8t 2 \u00bd0; 1\u0007, there\nexists some pt 2 \u2018t such that H\u00f0pt\u00de \u00bc c 8t 2 \u00bd0; 1\u0007. By construction, given\nt; t0 2 \u00bd0; 1\u0007 t 6\u00bc t0 we have pt 6\u00bc pt0 since \u2018t \\ \u2018t0 \u00bc fug whenever t 6\u00bc t0 which\nmeans fptgt2\u00bd0;1\u0007 is uncountable. In particular, there are tc; t0\nc 2 \u00bd0; 1\u0007 tc 6\u00bc t0\nc\nsuch that ptc \ufb04pt0\nc and H\u00f0ptc\u00de \u00bc H\u00f0pt0\nc\u00de \u00bc c for for every c 2 \u00f00; log jXj\u00de. h\n123\n682\nP.

{"question":"Explain how the different types of sensors (propagation, update, and joint sensors) contribute to the navigation and state estimation of a heterogeneous swarm of agents, as depicted in the provided figure. Discuss the potential challenges and benefits of integrating these sensors in a distributed multi-agent system.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[24],"raw_output":"","pred":"The figure illustrates a heterogeneous swarm of agents equipped with various types of sensors to enhance navigation and state estimation. Propagation sensors, such as IMUs, provide basic motion data, enabling agents to estimate their own movement and orientation. Update sensors, including cameras, GNSS, magnetometers, and barometers, offer more refined measurements by incorporating external information. These sensors help correct the drift in the agents' internal estimates, improving accuracy. Joint sensors, like relative pose and range/bearing, facilitate inter-agent communication, allowing agents to share information about their positions and orientations relative to each other.\n\nThe integration of these sensors in a distributed multi-agent system presents several challenges. Communication delays and sensor failures can disrupt the flow of information, affecting the overall accuracy of the state estimation. Additionally, the heterogeneous nature of the swarm, with varying sensor configurations, complicates the coordination and synchronization of sensor data.\n\nHowever, the benefits are significant. The diverse sensor suite enables robust navigation in complex environments, where a single sensor might fail or provide insufficient information. The distributed architecture allows for fault tolerance, as the loss of one agent or sensor does not necessarily halt the entire system. Furthermore, the ability to scale the number of agents and sensors enhances the system's adaptability and resilience.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[24,89,99,101,146,100,111,75,182,97,79,149,95,16,17,74,105,114,76,108,162,9,102,5,93,106,178,77,104,151,145,160,177,83,96,179,194,201,20,128,192,203,205,110,193,195,18,23,82,180,183,21,72,124,204,88,196,15,19,98,152,14,28,113,132,115,150,166,86,197,122,121,131,148,206,223,10,22,107,116,123,212,94,184,202,221,81,191,207,215,130,199,85,214,210,158,11,84,134,157,181,198,109,117,164,6,147,90,161,185,190,25,87,13,126,133,220,125,53,42,208,209,218,29,59,73,217,222,50,159,155,127,129,156,211,8,142,143,189,216,48,119,213,63,120,153,174,154,118,35,200,169,188,46,78,27,69,43,45,55,144,70,103,80,4,31,49,26,165,57,186,224,32,71,1,64,163,44,54,60,141,219,92,68,112,30,40,187,36,39,139,167,140,33,37,47,137,67,62,91,136,225,34,41,58,51,56,138,172,168,38,52,65,170,66,171,135,175,3,176,61,173,12,7,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

It is defined as \\(d_M = \\sqrt{(p - \\mu)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (p - \\mu)}\\), where \\(p\\) is the point, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the distribution, and \\(\\Sigma\\) is the covariance matrix.\n- **Advantages:** It is scale-invariant and accounts for the correlation between variables, making it suitable for multivariate data. It provides a measure of how many standard deviations a point is away from the mean, which is particularly useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the variables are correlated.\n- **Application:** Mahalanobis distance is more appropriate when dealing with multivariate data or when the variables are not independent.\n\n**Euclidean Distance:**\n- **Definition:** The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.

This reduces the need for frequent communication between nodes, thereby minimizing the overhead and complexity associated with information exchange.\n\n2. **Reduced Computational Load**: By approximating and distributing relevant cross-covariance terms, IKF significantly reduces the computational load.

This modularity enhances scalability and adaptability, making it suitable for dynamic environments where sensor configurations may change.\n\n4. **Handling of Delayed Measurements**: IKF introduces a buffering scheme that enables the processing of delayed measurements, which is crucial in distributed systems where measurements may arrive out of order. This ensures that the system can maintain accurate state estimates even when data is not received in real-time.\n\n5. **Stability and Accuracy**: The IKF paradigm ensures that the system maintains a finite, unique, and stable steady-state covariance matrix, which is essential for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the state estimates.\n\nOverall, IKF addresses the challenges of communication and computational efficiency by enabling efficient processing, reducing communication overhead, and maintaining stability and accuracy in distributed multi-agent systems.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[179,146,178,201,174,145,177,6,9,205,148,206,207,160,116,162,25,147,128,161,208,164,115,184,114,131,163,11,180,21,5,14,19,17,143,22,181,149,16,23,83,117,202,171,10,158,170,15,24,169,209,20,176,218,8,175,71,45,185,151,196,82,191,102,44,104,129,190,192,74,94,119,215,77,93,105,153,111,121,167,216,18,110,127,133,168,195,198,98,193,223,132,182,214,84,194,189,197,88,220,123,183,217,219,97,156,157,73,99,124,173,221,150,165,166,211,4,134,213,27,86,42,46,122,210,13,49,172,203,204,212,222,48,79,125,126,96,130,154,199,90,101,100,187,224,72,89,109,159,28,75,76,152,155,200,47,50,85,112,186,78,81,144,188,1,80,103,141,142,87,34,70,92,95,140,106,120,31,118,29,35,32,108,36,107,53,225,59,63,136,137,64,33,38,26,51,91,69,39,40,54,55,43,60,138,139,135,57,58,30,52,66,113,41,37,12,62,67,68,3,56,65,61,2,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This might speed up the search process and allow EvoMAL to explore more promising structures.\n\n2. **Enhanced Local Search Mechanisms**: Since binary operators are more common, local search mechanisms could be optimized to more effectively navigate the space of these operators. This could lead to faster convergence and better solutions.\n\n3. **Feature Engineering**: The high frequency of binary operators might indicate that certain features or interactions between features are particularly important for loss function design. Future studies could focus on identifying and incorporating these features into the search space.\n\n4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The observed frequencies could guide the tuning of EvoMAL's hyperparameters, such as the mutation rate for binary versus unary operators, to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively.\n\nBy leveraging this insight, EvoMAL could be tailored to more efficiently discover high-performing loss functions, potentially leading to faster and more effective meta-learning of loss functions.","source":"data/test/2406.09713.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[77,159,52,70,53,74,76,79,80,49,78,84,54,3,158,64,160,61,66,81,51,67,105,85,56,72,163,22,57,63,91,55,82,73,44,68,83,65,45,47,71,93,157,75,46,69,17,50,8,175,37,131,21,168,171,164,169,165,154,12,119,170,180,167,178,36,176,145,150,59,144,151,129,130,10,38,116,181,15,23,172,86,60,101,179,161,166,34,62,182,134,141,173,98,40,106,122,162,30,126,133,136,32,88,96,107,117,123,42,137,140,155,177,41,58,109,19,26,132,152,16,25,124,31,104,127,174,5,94,113,13,39,143,20,27,29,102,108,142,128,111,135,138,28,87,110,146,7,95,99,103,9,147,100,148,33,115,118,149,120,121,11,14,139,90,97,153,18,35,92,43,112,6,114,125,1,48,4,89,2,156,24],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The plots show the penultimate layer representations of AlexNet on CIFAR-10, using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction. \n\nKey observations include:\n\n1. **Inter-class Separation**: The visualizations demonstrate that both the cross-entropy loss and the absolute cross-entropy loss (with ϕ1 = 1) lead to representations with good inter-class separation. This is evident from the distinct clusters of points corresponding to different classes, indicating that the model has learned to distinguish between different classes effectively.\n\n2. **Generalization Performance**: The text mentions that the absolute cross-entropy loss with ϕ1 = 1.1 achieves the lowest test error (14.92%) among the methods shown. This suggests that while both the cross-entropy and absolute cross-entropy (ϕ1 = 1) have good inter-class separation, the absolute cross-entropy with a slightly higher ϕ1 value (ϕ1 = 1.1) leads to better generalization performance.\n\n3. **Label Smoothing Regularization**: The label smoothing regularization (ξ = 0.1) also shows good inter-class separation, with tight intra-class representations. This indicates that label smoothing helps in learning more robust representations that generalize well.\n\n4. **Consistency with Theoretical Analysis**: The visualizations support the theoretical findings that label smoothing regularization and the absolute cross-entropy loss with ϕ1 > 1 yield similar regularization effects, leading to better discriminative inter-class representations and tighter intra-class representations.\n\nIn summary, the visualizations confirm that good inter-class separation is crucial for achieving high generalization performance in image classification tasks.

This is crucial because unprotected division operations can lead to undefined or imaginary outputs, violating the GP closure property, which requires that all operations within the search space must produce valid results without causing NaN, Inf, undefined, or complex outputs.\n\nIn contrast, the AQ operator ensures that all operations within the search space remain valid and well-defined, thereby maintaining the GP closure property. This is particularly important in loss function discovery, where the search space needs to be dense with promising new loss functions while also containing sufficiently simple functions for cross-task generalization. By using the AQ operator, EvoMAL can explore a wider range of loss function structures without encountering invalid operations, leading to more robust and generalizable loss functions.\n\nThe AQ operator's advantages over the traditional division operator include:\n1. **Smoothness and Differentiability**: The AQ operator is differentiable, which is essential for gradient-based optimization methods used in EvoMAL.\n2. **Avoidance of NaN and Inf**: It ensures that all operations remain valid, preventing the generation of invalid results.\n3. **Simplicity and Generalizability**: It allows for the inclusion of simpler loss functions, facilitating cross-task generalization.\n\nOverall, the AQ operator enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of EvoMAL by providing a safer and more versatile alternative to the traditional division operator in the context of loss function discovery.","source":"data/test/2406.09713.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[53,52,57,176,159,61,74,77,64,158,49,54,79,55,51,91,71,45,84,22,67,70,76,160,63,3,105,65,78,56,80,59,69,85,66,82,44,81,157,72,163,75,173,47,175,8,36,46,58,181,68,34,93,37,62,73,17,83,131,180,182,40,165,171,15,117,145,164,166,21,96,115,132,154,167,98,168,169,177,7,13,116,161,170,172,35,42,107,109,140,138,141,174,179,32,50,122,12,23,123,143,151,86,106,113,136,19,20,30,60,5,99,119,134,155,178,10,18,28,87,29,124,25,41,43,88,89,130,148,150,110,111,144,90,92,133,137,16,31,100,101,118,128,142,149,27,95,129,152,162,1,38,39,33,108,139,14,97,126,112,114,9,127,135,6,94,120,26,102,146,153,125,11,104,4,121,147,48,2,103,24,156],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The model becomes highly tuned to the specific training examples, but generalizes poorly to new data.\n\nIn contrast, using validation samples for the meta-objective results in higher training error and slower convergence. This approach encourages the learned loss function to generalize better to unseen data, as it is optimized to minimize error on a separate validation set.

This is because Demographic Parity requires the classifier to steadily classify more of the negative region as positive, which directly reduces the accuracy on Group B.\n\nIn contrast, the accuracy of Group B under the Equal Opportunity and Equalized Odds constraints remains relatively stable. Equal Opportunity ensures that the true positive rate for Group B is equal to that of Group A, while Equalized Odds ensures that the positive and negative predictive values are equal across groups. These constraints do not require the classifier to change its classification strategy as the probability of positives from Group B increases, thus maintaining a higher accuracy for Group B.\n\nThe implications of these observations are significant in the context of fairness-aware classifiers. Demographic Parity, while ensuring that the classifier treats both groups equally in terms of the proportion of positives, can lead to suboptimal performance on Group B as the bias in the data becomes more pronounced. On the other hand, Equal Opportunity and Equalized Odds, by focusing on specific fairness metrics, can mitigate the negative effects of bias, leading to better overall performance and fairness.

Initially, all methods exhibit high reconstruction error, but as the number of anchors increases, the error decreases for all methods. Specifically, the affine and linear methods show a sharp decrease in error, reaching a minimum around 400 anchors, after which the error plateaus. The l-ortho and ortho methods also show a decrease in error, but their performance is more stable, with the error remaining relatively low even at higher anchor numbers.\n\nThe observed trends in reconstruction error can be explained by the increasing number of anchors providing more data points for the stitching methods to learn from. As the number of anchors increases, the methods have more information to estimate the transformation \\( b_T \\) accurately. This leads to better alignment between the latent spaces of the two autoencoders, resulting in lower reconstruction error. The affine and linear methods, which are simpler transformations, benefit more from the additional data points, leading to a sharper decrease in error.

The high lcos indicates a strong alignment between the latent representations of the autoencoders, which implies that the affine transformation is capable of capturing the underlying structure and relationships between the latent spaces more accurately than other methods.\n\nThe results imply that the nature of transformations between latent spaces in autoencoders is not exclusively controlled by orthogonal transformations.

{"question":"How does varying the prompt size (g) from 1 to 3 impact the understandability and relevance of prompts generated through Directed Diversity, and what trade-offs do these effects suggest for message ideation?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[41],"raw_output":"","pred":"Varying the prompt size (g) from 1 to 3 in Directed Diversity significantly impacts the understandability and relevance of generated prompts. With a prompt size of g = 1, the prompts are more concise and focused, leading to higher understandability and relevance. This is because a single phrase provides a clear and direct context, making it easier for ideators to grasp the intended message and relate it to their ideation process. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of diversity, as the limited context might not fully capture the nuances and complexities of the ideation task.\n\nAs the prompt size increases to g = 3, the prompts become more detailed and context-rich, enhancing the diversity of the ideation process. This increased diversity can lead to more creative and varied ideations, as the ideators are exposed to a broader range of perspectives and ideas. However, the higher complexity of the prompts can also lead to lower understandability and relevance. The ideators might find it harder to comprehend the full context and integrate the multiple phrases effectively, potentially hindering the ideation process.\n\nThe trade-offs suggest that while larger prompts offer greater diversity, they require more cognitive effort to understand and utilize effectively. Conversely, smaller prompts are easier to understand but may limit the ideation's breadth and creativity. Therefore, the optimal prompt size depends on the specific ideation task and the balance between understandability, relevance, and diversity required for effective ideation.","source":"data/test/2404.13633.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[43,41,40,51,52,142,48,44,126,27,53,26,91,39,123,7,2,49,34,37,5,90,10,13,16,42,50,38,140,143,9,28,94,33,35,18,101,22,12,11,46,141,45,124,92,31,134,6,32,117,127,133,102,95,139,36,128,99,30,93,104,108,113,138,23,119,132,121,71,135,62,81,55,122,58,114,15,29,107,47,61,160,70,21,73,131,96,24,57,68,56,75,89,110,111,115,116,3,60,66,88,105,14,25,64,120,136,54,97,137,86,150,59,69,112,144,147,20,74,78,80,85,65,67,76,82,98,106,164,79,83,125,152,161,63,77,109,118,145,129,156,87,103,146,72,162,100,149,159,151,157,8,153,19,84,155,17,130,154,1,158,148,163,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What can be inferred about the relationship between the rate of transaction issuance and the rate of block mining in the Bitcoin blockchain, and how does this relate to the concept of contention transparency?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[37],"raw_output":"","pred":"The figure shows that the rate of transaction issuance in the Bitcoin blockchain has been consistently high, with 50% of all transactions added to the blockchain in just 3 years. However, the rate of block mining has been slower, with only 50% of blocks mined in the same period. This indicates a significant disparity between the rate of transaction issuance and the rate of block mining.\n\nThis disparity suggests that there is a high level of contention for block space, as more transactions are being issued than can be mined into blocks. The concept of contention transparency refers to the assumption that all transactions are publicly broadcasted and available to all miners, allowing users to infer the set of uncommitted transactions available to a miner at any point in time.\n\nHowever, the figure shows that only a small portion of transactions (approximately 20%) have been included in blocks by 2019. This implies that not all transactions are publicly broadcasted and available to all miners, which contradicts the assumption of contention transparency. The high rate of transaction issuance and slow rate of block mining suggest that many transactions are being excluded from the block chain, likely due to factors such as transaction fees, block size limitations, or other prioritization mechanisms. This lack of contention transparency can lead to inefficiencies and potential unfairness in the transaction prioritization process.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,109,34,29,107,13,14,48,69,82,49,73,127,113,126,25,125,64,76,145,71,85,6,114,70,75,108,116,26,63,83,124,32,47,12,16,27,46,72,11,68,19,87,15,21,66,28,38,78,84,123,24,51,118,42,50,60,112,120,33,77,36,122,22,79,20,52,111,17,53,90,99,147,43,74,45,58,104,106,110,121,115,119,4,57,44,86,30,55,62,91,5,54,65,130,39,88,41,67,81,139,93,35,96,98,143,56,59,80,136,146,94,142,149,95,144,105,135,89,141,97,129,103,131,40,61,101,148,92,102,18,150,31,140,7,138,100,137,151,133,128,134,23,132,1,9,117,2,3,8,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As the Mempool becomes more congested, users increase their transaction fees to incentivize miners to prioritize their transactions for inclusion in the next block.

This indicates that miners prioritize transactions with higher fees, leading to faster inclusion in the blockchain.\n\nUsers employ this strategy by adjusting their transaction fees based on the current Mempool congestion levels. When the Mempool is congested, users increase their fees to ensure their transactions are included in the next block, thereby reducing the commit delay.

This is because the arbitrary data stored within these transactions can obscure the actual value transferred. The protocol specification for the Omni Layer Protocol (Omni Layer, 2020) outlines the structure and purpose of these data fields, but the interpretation of this data requires specialized knowledge and tools.\n\nThis opacity of transaction values can exacerbate issues related to transaction fee opacity and fairness. In a blockchain system, fees are typically used to incentivize miners to prioritize transactions. However, when the true value of a transaction is not immediately apparent, it becomes difficult for miners to accurately assess and prioritize transactions based on their fees. This can lead to unfairness, where transactions with higher fees might not be prioritized as expected, or where miners might exploit the lack of transparency to manipulate the fee structure.\n\nFurthermore, the use of OP_Return data can create a potential for abuse, such as miners accelerating their own transactions or colluding with other mining pools to prioritize beneficial transactions.

{"question":"What is the relationship between future independence in local rational semigroup transductions and the locality equation, and how does this relationship facilitate the transformation between local semigroup transductions and local rational semigroup transductions?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[156],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between future independence in local rational semigroup transductions and the locality equation is crucial for transforming between local semigroup transductions and local rational semigroup transductions. Future independence ensures that the output of a transduction does not depend on future input letters, which is a key property for both types of transductions. The locality equation, on the other hand, restricts the behavior of the transduction to ensure that it only depends on the current and past input letters, not on future ones.\n\nThis relationship facilitates the transformation by allowing the use of a future-independent output function. For local semigroup transductions, a future-independent output function can be defined as λ′(x, a, y) = λ(x · h(a)), where h is a polynomial orbit-finite representation of the semigroup. This function ensures that the output does not depend on future input letters, making it future-independent.\n\nConversely, for local rational semigroup transductions, a future-independent output function can be defined using a semigroup S′ that tracks the last letter of a word. This semigroup is defined as S′ = (S + 1) × Σ, with operations that ensure the output function λ′((x, a)) = λ(x, a, ⊣) (or λ(⊢, a, ⊣) if x = 1) is future-independent. The locality equation ensures that the transduction behaves correctly under permutations of the input, further facilitating the transformation.\n\nIn summary, the future independence and locality equation work together to ensure that the transformation between local semigroup transductions and local rational semigroup transductions is valid and maintains the desired properties of the transductions.","source":"data/test/2406.18934.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[156,155,132,167,106,215,150,149,146,153,157,105,103,172,3,154,169,152,183,173,210,102,109,104,151,107,23,100,11,214,135,168,189,101,182,80,147,188,82,211,218,99,141,185,21,176,133,216,20,13,65,123,166,174,24,32,171,196,212,25,35,46,111,116,14,92,4,19,219,88,186,2,12,28,217,89,91,93,114,125,140,170,36,142,175,179,31,203,213,9,160,124,128,138,187,66,139,194,201,26,39,184,41,45,112,159,206,34,69,97,113,22,59,117,120,220,18,122,148,207,33,83,87,90,127,181,47,67,27,37,49,161,180,48,158,38,61,63,71,98,115,129,40,86,134,143,204,30,94,119,126,200,205,64,68,85,110,121,178,197,208,42,50,62,136,60,77,198,209,51,162,56,57,70,131,164,202,6,54,74,79,96,16,78,81,177,190,75,84,137,144,193,76,130,199,44,165,10,163,1,95,145,43,195,52,58,73,8,15,191,55,29,72,192,7,108,118,5,53,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Provide an example to illustrate your answer.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[25],"raw_output":"","pred":"The concept of orbit-finiteness relates to classical finiteness in a nuanced way for sets with atoms. While classical finiteness is preserved under finite powersets and function spaces, orbit finiteness is not. This means that sets with atoms can be orbit-finite even if their finite powersets or function spaces are not.\n\nFor example, consider the set of all atoms A. This set is orbit-finite because it has only one orbit (the set of all atoms). However, the powerset of A (the set of all subsets of A) is not orbit-finite, as there are infinitely many subsets.\n\nThis distinction is important because it affects how certain operations and properties behave on sets with atoms. For instance, while finite powersets and function spaces are preserved under classical finiteness, they are not preserved under orbit finiteness. This means that some results from finite automata theory that hold for finite alphabets may not hold for infinite alphabets when considering orbit-finite sets.\n\nThe example of the set of all atoms illustrates that orbit-finiteness can capture a notion of \"finite-like\" behavior even when classical finiteness fails. This highlights the subtleties in working with sets with atoms and the need to carefully consider the appropriate finiteness conditions when dealing with infinite alphabets.","source":"data/test/2406.18934.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[26,25,102,215,116,66,51,59,28,88,52,94,34,49,85,173,29,70,119,46,48,86,103,27,110,152,153,44,100,60,3,129,10,65,89,115,53,105,41,45,84,2,124,128,30,43,79,76,114,126,159,182,123,99,220,15,35,11,193,64,90,97,20,23,36,138,37,157,175,185,31,68,21,132,187,127,137,184,183,58,80,146,147,149,181,67,139,71,112,177,69,83,120,24,50,208,216,22,148,96,205,151,219,77,179,217,61,155,98,178,214,39,95,204,125,140,154,9,12,33,38,172,211,101,218,13,170,47,87,93,180,156,176,32,54,111,130,189,210,160,171,117,141,162,7,91,122,150,209,40,16,161,113,212,78,121,191,207,14,57,158,166,168,213,104,134,135,163,164,92,131,169,62,142,107,109,196,81,145,165,194,203,19,42,63,8,167,186,202,6,56,82,106,144,199,198,1,133,190,17,174,195,201,4,108,143,197,18,5,74,136,192,200,72,188,206,55,75,118,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Filter 4, while enforcing the positional relationship, does not require the number of the object to match the predicate.\n\nTherefore, Filter 3 provides the most precise control over the positional relationship between subject, predicate, and object while still ensuring the number of the object matches the predicate, making it the most suitable choice for the specified criteria.","source":"data/test/2406.18276.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[76,62,99,60,57,56,54,55,59,139,77,25,66,78,142,63,61,140,18,141,73,71,64,70,72,100,116,167,121,80,87,165,88,89,79,127,126,81,180,93,115,123,92,105,120,113,117,68,124,37,179,35,125,185,67,137,138,58,119,144,159,170,182,201,39,29,97,118,145,171,178,36,108,143,160,166,169,20,109,114,136,151,157,175,74,91,104,38,69,90,106,156,181,186,28,135,149,168,204,27,65,112,162,164,122,161,34,44,52,102,153,110,111,133,134,148,158,183,98,103,147,172,107,9,42,75,129,84,163,40,43,45,95,152,193,85,94,96,130,154,195,200,21,41,49,101,131,13,33,83,173,2,4,6,8,16,24,30,50,128,146,150,190,196,174,32,202,53,197,22,155,188,187,199,203,17,47,26,31,19,86,12,176,132,192,7,51,184,11,198,46,48,23,82,5,10,194,177,189,1,14,191,15,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Firstly, the system's reliance on exact pāda matching can result in incorrect identification when there is a single error in a pāda, even if the majority of pādas are correct. This can lead to the overall meter being reported as 'unknown' due to the majority of pādas being mismatched. Secondly, the system lacks a suggestion mechanism for corrections, which can hinder the user's ability to address the detected errors effectively. Additionally, the system's inability to handle fuzzy matching, which is crucial for dealing with errors in the text, further limits its effectiveness. The system's focus on identifying the correct meter and catching errors in the text, while admirable, does not address the inherent challenges of exact pāda matching and the lack of a suggestion mechanism. These limitations can lead to undetected errors, especially in cases where the text contains multiple errors or where the errors are subtle and not easily identifiable through exact matching.","source":"data/test/2406.18276.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,175,26,157,156,154,166,174,22,172,49,171,9,44,81,155,74,80,201,107,37,73,153,193,194,108,158,159,173,29,48,78,104,103,169,18,75,162,163,77,25,56,72,76,95,167,202,33,149,195,71,119,164,203,41,79,84,100,39,53,59,83,170,34,28,35,192,58,200,8,43,60,62,147,165,204,32,57,96,36,141,10,19,42,47,54,105,123,124,161,180,52,70,140,51,55,109,7,40,45,64,85,115,185,186,92,118,82,184,143,148,177,190,3,23,46,97,101,138,20,111,120,125,129,191,98,130,160,1,65,66,112,127,181,199,106,122,27,61,68,113,151,197,198,114,150,152,178,179,5,12,17,88,126,133,189,67,131,182,183,137,142,15,69,187,99,102,117,139,145,146,188,136,110,89,134,31,63,121,21,144,86,116,87,132,93,90,38,168,94,91,13,135,11,14,2,4,6,16,24,30,50,128,196],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

Each chapter is represented as a JSON file containing text and optional extra information such as word segmentation, verse ID, and linguistic details. This information is then organized into a hierarchical structure, with each level providing a more detailed breakdown of the text.\n\nTo manage this hierarchical structure, the system uses a relational database compatible with SQLAlchemy, such as SQLite. This database stores the linguistic information, including lemmas (word roots) and entity annotations. Each entity annotation includes a lemma, an entity type, a line number, and the user ID of the annotator. Similarly, each relationship annotation includes source and target lemmas, a relationship type, an optional detail text, a line number, and the user ID of the annotator.\n\nFor querying this linguistic information, the system employs Neo4j as the graph database server. Neo4j is used to store and query the knowledge graph (KG), which is constructed using the entity and relationship annotations. The graph database can exist independently on a separate system, and queries are executed using the Cypher query language. This setup allows for efficient querying and analysis of the linguistic data, facilitating tasks such as semantic annotation and natural language processing.","source":"data/test/2406.18276.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[90,52,57,86,98,8,39,85,42,69,27,48,199,9,20,122,132,202,143,144,200,10,40,54,131,191,28,46,194,7,32,192,45,53,103,134,51,102,203,133,159,41,88,33,43,104,153,171,119,83,89,91,139,157,178,184,185,61,70,169,186,198,35,84,101,175,180,182,189,31,34,107,124,193,36,152,183,204,19,58,87,138,145,163,172,195,109,114,162,71,82,121,165,44,100,105,149,158,173,38,49,108,123,1,55,62,115,151,23,56,21,47,129,177,3,72,99,118,120,130,181,17,25,29,37,92,95,97,137,141,154,5,26,66,78,93,135,190,74,81,156,166,170,179,187,59,142,197,201,67,127,146,150,174,148,176,60,63,73,79,112,125,126,136,77,106,147,18,22,64,155,164,75,94,111,140,12,161,68,76,113,188,13,80,110,11,167,116,168,96,160,65,2,4,6,16,24,30,50,128,196,117,15,14],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The triangular space thus serves as a visual tool to explore the relationships between distributions and the principles of d-disorder, making it easier to grasp the underlying mathematical concepts.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[80,284,283,285,257,279,277,278,276,79,286,244,282,54,189,280,242,248,288,287,211,266,64,281,336,61,81,292,13,59,95,116,256,222,289,78,339,77,252,320,49,263,48,71,76,117,118,268,245,2,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,18,22,32,45,46,60,84,110,128,142,144,233,240,55,82,138,186,208,178,231,265,267,291,63,146,205,249,68,132,62,73,114,272,299,56,58,154,158,273,52,53,74,103,212,258,214,333,161,183,29,67,75,121,199,216,269,21,34,125,348,353,72,85,93,119,218,355,362,66,213,89,113,134,148,290,309,43,123,177,217,243,255,19,127,135,137,206,226,262,369,26,129,179,190,201,228,229,334,6,27,30,105,295,335,337,344,57,195,200,41,102,225,342,343,347,363,31,96,207,215,327,24,50,108,175,181,191,39,94,126,236,261,130,139,197,210,301,302,326,361,38,51,112,140,149,159,264,151,324,331,37,104,162,163,193,198,224,322,40,107,184,204,230,232,234,235,247,294,303,92,120,136,152,188,315,316,332,341,28,69,221,296,298,346,5,97,124,131,237,250,253,328,35,223,260,349,367,9,164,270,319,321,330,352,360,368,14,20,165,172,318,345,356,358,25,36,99,338,340,42,47,122,170,173,185,238,297,311,351,169,251,300,305,325,350,1,70,91,171,271,354,90,100,275,98,155,192,307,310,147,153,160,219,259,304,359,88,133,166,209,246,317,293,323,101,141,176,182,227,308,312,115,220,241,314,10,106,33,86,167,187,254,23,87,150,180,313,194,196,329,65,370,44,83,357,111,157,168,174,145,274,202,366,156,203,17,364,239,306,365,3,109,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}]}

This abstract approach to uncertainty has applications in understanding the maximum entropy principle, molecular diffusion, and quantum resource theories.\n\nThese contributions demonstrate how the author's unified uncertainty framework can connect seemingly disparate fields and provide new insights into complex systems.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[23,126,116,20,28,114,44,47,6,5,25,33,72,24,127,204,35,122,276,289,19,31,89,112,115,121,37,113,85,93,162,34,103,175,82,163,219,52,111,86,92,200,91,294,30,83,123,148,218,27,38,172,21,100,134,164,208,295,124,222,40,173,41,88,133,233,39,87,136,201,283,368,43,119,330,102,221,75,108,211,94,139,171,209,49,97,107,146,238,292,176,42,51,90,98,120,132,269,291,36,73,99,135,138,297,314,327,26,70,101,117,331,76,285,361,10,96,131,147,151,153,169,293,296,95,328,125,140,277,369,137,178,104,149,161,63,129,205,302,14,106,177,188,223,235,290,319,1,60,105,130,282,301,326,9,165,263,141,239,242,152,203,207,210,232,69,202,206,215,234,268,273,315,356,29,77,81,343,214,305,50,53,199,310,323,324,333,48,79,155,197,303,367,55,58,109,150,227,236,261,306,321,157,216,217,280,220,244,265,196,237,342,160,260,353,355,307,317,213,62,179,181,312,316,357,158,212,298,311,334,347,80,192,247,250,266,118,159,180,226,304,332,193,194,228,300,348,167,182,262,284,309,64,78,168,229,278,279,318,338,354,360,186,187,190,246,258,267,271,274,281,308,325,358,56,59,61,66,225,251,335,370,243,346,249,344,198,231,255,287,288,320,65,253,345,184,195,257,259,3,145,185,254,264,299,322,337,340,352,154,329,359,13,166,191,270,341,362,156,170,174,272,313,336,339,351,363,54,71,57,74,189,350,349,364,365,230,224,245,252,256,275,286,183,241,248,2,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,17,18,22,32,45,46,67,84,110,128,142,144,240,68,366,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This process ensures that even if Eve tampers with the communication channel, the shared secret remains secure and uniformly random, as long as the adversary does not tamper with both sources simultaneously.

The \"Total Shares\" curve (solid lines) shows a steady increase over time, reaching a peak and then plateauing. In contrast, the \"Current Shares\" curve (dashed lines) exhibits a more complex behavior. It initially increases rapidly, reaching a peak, and then declines, eventually stabilizing at a lower level than the \"Total Shares\" curve.\n\nThis difference indicates that while the total number of shares continues to grow, the number of current shares (unread/live copies) eventually decreases. This suggests that as more users view and share the content, the pool of unread shares diminishes, leading to a saturation point where the rate of new shares slows down. This phenomenon is likely due to the finite number of potential recipients and the diminishing returns on sharing as the content becomes more widely known.\n\nThe behavior of the \"Current Shares\" curve also implies that the rate of new shares is not constant but rather decreases over time, which is a key factor in the saturation of content propagation. This insight is crucial for understanding how content spreads and eventually stabilizes on social networks, highlighting the importance of initial momentum and the diminishing returns in viral marketing.","source":"data/test/2406.08594.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[131,142,140,141,132,139,133,143,165,138,137,72,101,19,128,87,91,100,130,85,73,166,84,144,164,123,7,216,76,129,124,136,26,77,17,83,108,80,96,54,86,135,23,30,47,18,92,127,21,215,11,22,74,179,29,217,118,163,168,12,31,60,219,88,8,20,41,52,75,94,149,218,53,68,27,146,59,79,2,4,125,157,148,194,14,25,56,58,10,16,28,48,51,81,90,55,109,159,98,150,153,89,107,213,115,120,122,152,161,178,9,71,151,155,212,220,57,82,95,214,36,49,67,103,121,38,46,93,126,145,198,5,15,33,102,112,110,111,162,167,173,114,222,176,200,65,208,35,50,183,196,66,113,185,62,104,184,156,97,69,154,170,172,187,193,117,211,174,175,203,204,119,158,206,42,70,181,64,116,221,37,186,207,106,39,147,160,24,40,78,202,1,43,201,210,105,188,205,190,209,99,171,180,182,195,197,177,134,169,192,34,199,63,32,45,191,44,3,61,189,13,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

By utilizing a larger weight ($w$) in the design, eh2-WM ensures that the warning levels are sufficiently high to guide users effectively, regardless of the number of aware users. This robustness is further supported by the fact that the i-QoS under eh2-WM is consistently higher than that under the enhanced WM (eh-WM) for all $\\mu_a$ values, indicating that the high warning signals provided by eh2-WM are more effective in guiding users to identify fake posts.

However, the generated video often lacks the specific details and nuances of the original video, indicating limitations in capturing the subtleties of complex actions.\n\nOverall, these observations suggest that while the model can generate coherent sequences of frames, it struggles with capturing the fine details, nuanced motion, and specific object appearances of complex actions and events.","source":"data/test/2405.16728.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[121,122,112,119,14,64,117,16,114,102,138,103,115,118,10,140,143,151,163,48,109,158,116,111,144,75,91,137,92,105,139,141,142,76,157,22,107,108,2,63,93,120,77,128,84,136,167,171,23,87,149,106,15,101,161,162,20,104,26,61,78,86,100,155,165,62,97,5,21,135,125,129,147,13,74,94,34,54,47,58,65,81,85,90,96,195,56,164,172,153,9,28,72,79,95,110,148,199,46,66,80,89,113,127,150,160,30,31,27,82,152,154,38,60,73,186,123,156,178,41,83,99,184,188,49,53,196,4,12,40,98,134,185,193,68,176,19,173,197,198,35,55,69,71,130,177,182,6,51,52,194,200,1,88,133,11,33,45,59,189,18,126,57,132,145,183,24,67,131,70,187,36,168,190,146,159,179,192,8,42,7,29,32,174,3,170,37,50,124,39,191,25,175,43,166,180,181,17,169,44],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is because the GPU can handle parallel computations more effectively, reducing the per-iteration computation time. However, the GPU implementation requires specialized hardware and may not be as accessible or cost-effective as the multi-threaded CPU implementation.\n\nIn terms of resource competition, the multi-threaded CPU implementation faces a scenario where each problem instantiation competes for computational resources, potentially slowing down the overall computation time. This can be mitigated by running sequential instantiations with mini-batches of 5, as observed in the experiments. Therefore, for applications requiring high scalability and efficiency, the GPU implementation is recommended. For scenarios where resource competition is a concern or where specialized hardware is not available, the multi-threaded CPU implementation might be a more practical choice.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[67,75,66,12,94,90,93,48,10,55,56,65,82,19,81,91,46,86,11,6,92,95,52,77,83,50,18,64,98,44,38,49,32,34,54,70,104,53,76,30,57,14,85,20,43,63,35,36,87,96,47,29,69,100,37,60,61,78,101,8,42,26,79,107,33,88,106,15,45,102,103,72,105,25,89,31,17,7,71,80,59,2,27,68,24,28,16,84,41,62,99,73,13,39,58,74,109,23,112,40,4,111,97,110,22,51,108,21,3,1,9,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

It includes tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing data. This phase is essential for improving the quality of the data, making it easier to detect anomalies.\n\n2. **Dataset Patterns Generation**: In this phase, the preprocessed data is transformed into patterns that highlight anomalies.

These values suggest that the MSCEqF provides a highly accurate and reliable trajectory estimation, suitable for real-time applications on resource-constrained aerial platforms.","source":"data/test/2407.14297v1.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[153,148,14,150,151,158,145,9,15,146,133,143,160,11,152,154,16,24,149,172,22,157,147,74,111,126,142,6,110,131,114,72,77,113,125,13,76,116,94,107,127,132,78,141,161,75,112,128,8,60,96,130,139,105,166,71,73,118,156,82,83,98,62,102,117,23,50,103,108,59,91,180,173,51,85,129,134,19,20,55,67,86,106,5,93,121,175,92,162,170,68,87,97,101,58,63,79,89,124,36,52,70,104,177,54,64,10,115,120,135,144,45,84,123,138,174,21,29,61,39,155,176,38,57,69,122,168,171,136,163,17,47,119,159,1,7,18,53,65,109,178,179,28,34,43,80,3,44,66,137,164,26,90,167,12,41,99,140,31,33,35,56,165,27,46,100,25,169,2,81,95,40,48,4,37,88,49,32,30,42],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

One key approach is the implementation of automated material identification systems, such as SensiCut, which uses speckle sensing and deep learning to identify materials and adjust settings accordingly. This not only enhances safety by preventing the use of hazardous materials but also streamlines the workflow, reducing the time and effort required for users to identify and set up materials. Additionally, the literature advocates for the use of smart sensing platforms that can provide real-time safety alerts and prevent human error, thereby mitigating the risks associated with incorrect material selection and improper laser settings. These systems can significantly lower the entry barrier to laser cutting, making it safer and more accessible for all users.","source":"data/test/2407.11748.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[45,168,43,41,158,157,164,171,56,174,65,170,32,50,152,36,155,7,177,133,156,159,44,27,55,64,12,15,28,31,37,163,88,151,153,67,113,134,14,147,4,51,11,130,19,42,16,146,172,13,109,24,111,139,169,20,18,47,63,30,23,175,26,135,8,87,100,145,53,62,82,101,89,107,126,3,35,110,49,173,25,176,165,167,112,166,60,118,119,128,161,179,66,108,68,78,178,75,148,150,69,10,91,142,61,77,129,143,39,48,90,1,22,52,2,38,80,85,125,138,160,127,29,58,81,120,137,17,93,84,131,46,114,141,144,34,40,54,136,9,76,92,70,83,149,99,5,122,140,57,117,105,97,33,59,102,71,79,103,132,96,6,115,72,116,121,124,95,154,74,98,106,104,73,162,94,123,21,86],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As the filtration threshold increases, simplicial complexes are formed, which represent different topological features such as connected components, loops, and voids. Each simplicial complex is associated with a birth and death time, indicating when it first appears and when it disappears as the filtration threshold increases.\n\nBarcodes and persistent diagrams are visual representations of this filtration process. A barcode is a collection of intervals, where each interval corresponds to a topological feature that appears and disappears during the filtration. The length of the interval indicates the persistence of the feature, which is a measure of its stability. Persistent diagrams, on the other hand, are a more detailed representation that shows the birth and death times of each feature as a point in a 2D plot.\n\nThese representations convey important information about the topological features of the data. For example, long intervals in barcodes or persistent diagrams indicate robust features that are likely to be significant, while short intervals suggest transient features that are less reliable. By analyzing these representations, researchers can identify stable topological features that are likely to be meaningful in the context of the data, such as connected components that represent distinct clusters or loops that indicate cyclic patterns.","source":"data/test/2408.11948.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[129,131,124,136,130,141,17,122,18,15,145,16,144,142,133,135,126,48,56,85,4,127,132,134,166,109,143,158,148,7,168,165,128,119,157,139,121,53,125,123,64,31,140,110,37,149,13,43,49,74,120,73,75,112,117,138,154,167,76,78,159,3,11,24,46,108,163,25,80,147,84,111,115,155,6,47,63,66,161,28,33,68,102,10,77,104,150,153,156,9,29,32,45,58,93,100,114,35,36,65,72,79,118,151,164,14,30,82,137,152,160,42,92,50,54,86,27,38,61,83,98,5,44,52,21,51,57,70,103,105,116,39,55,94,113,146,162,26,97,34,60,69,106,71,99,90,19,59,1,91,87,67,12,20,81,40,88,96,89,22,62,41,23,101,95,8,107,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Mind wandering, particularly when it is meta-aware (MM), can serve as a coping mechanism to manage affective states such as frustration or lack of motivation. Participants who engage in MM may allow themselves to continue mind wandering after becoming aware of it, which can hinder their ability to focus on the lecture content and ignore personal distractions. This behavior can lead to a decrease in deep-level understanding, as the cognitive resources required for deep processing are diverted to managing their internal states rather than actively engaging with the lecture material.\n\nAdditionally, the MM rate might reflect a lack of motivation or engagement with the lecture content, which is known to negatively impact learning outcomes. When participants are not fully invested in the learning process, they are less likely to engage in deep-level thinking and comprehension, leading to poorer performance on deep-level understanding tests.

Unlike earlier methods that often struggled with diverse camera angles and student occlusions, this approach uses long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to analyze body pose embeddings. This allows for more accurate and robust detection of hand-raising gestures, even when students are filmed from various angles and partially obscured by classmates or learning materials.\n\nPrevious approaches often mapped hand-raisings to individual students but were not evaluated on real-world classroom videos containing authentic hand-raisings. The proposed method, however, is specifically designed to work with diverse real-world classroom data, enabling the identification of individual students' hand-raisings for post hoc analysis in education research.

As α increases, the number of different votes decreases, leading to fewer points on the map. This is because the urn model, when α is large, results in a higher probability of drawing a vote that has already been drawn, thus reducing the diversity of votes. For instance, with α = 0, the model is equivalent to the Impartial Anonymous Neutral Culture (IANC), where all votes are unique. As α increases, the probability of drawing a vote that has already been drawn increases, leading to a higher chance of generating identical votes.\n\nThe mathematical upper bound for the expected number of different votes under the urn model is given by the formula \\( P_{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{1 + (i-1)\\alpha} \\). This formula represents the upper bound on the expected number of different votes, where \\( n \\) is the number of voters, and \\( \\alpha \\) is the parameter of contagion. The upper bound is derived by considering the probability of having a new vote in each iteration, which decreases as \\( \\alpha \\) increases.

Red points, representing sensor positions, are strategically placed in areas of high event density, as indicated by the green points, which represent event occurrences.

This strategic placement of sensors in these dense regions can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of environmental monitoring. By focusing on areas with persistent activity, the monitoring system can more accurately capture and analyze environmental phenomena, leading to more reliable and actionable insights.

Introduce a new parameter:\n   - Define a new parameter r as the radius of the circles.\n\nThese changes would allow the algorithm to find a feasible solution that respects the partial overlap constraint while still optimizing for the number of circles and avoiding complete overlap.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[71,70,68,75,175,58,76,73,54,61,57,482,484,31,126,145,249,369,24,53,480,485,64,144,248,67,14,338,95,150,66,189,282,481,220,60,63,65,206,221,483,370,59,136,253,313,332,153,217,244,50,171,173,263,368,45,132,51,134,417,47,235,333,35,49,131,298,404,62,32,219,252,257,39,72,286,38,266,316,337,371,469,213,236,247,214,336,383,56,130,163,223,304,391,335,386,393,187,212,218,279,318,325,388,405,430,479,25,55,87,285,329,267,334,259,381,387,415,52,113,164,245,385,394,3,15,85,122,165,174,210,297,301,344,395,414,465,33,140,172,29,156,176,256,260,365,422,77,186,193,292,306,309,340,157,166,216,283,354,358,478,9,13,34,207,239,476,27,135,152,168,211,232,317,118,238,287,439,446,8,78,124,240,303,366,419,420,23,46,48,83,97,117,342,349,108,141,243,258,274,299,432,470,16,26,116,148,190,242,281,294,296,421,464,69,188,198,199,261,346,376,423,43,110,268,347,359,363,450,21,202,222,295,378,416,434,10,11,114,162,167,246,280,305,455,22,74,91,127,159,284,300,302,328,389,392,409,411,460,36,40,84,112,120,129,143,197,201,250,311,322,451,461,472,12,92,226,231,262,277,382,390,403,2,82,181,183,362,427,5,154,255,323,435,4,41,44,94,184,237,312,314,384,396,412,436,473,6,28,115,119,137,185,200,315,348,375,431,449,133,204,271,330,379,380,397,438,457,17,178,179,278,326,477,42,80,98,293,37,289,356,401,429,486,101,103,147,151,161,205,272,310,345,351,377,399,440,475,30,93,100,169,192,208,241,324,357,367,442,448,468,20,81,275,307,408,413,428,445,142,264,273,341,350,447,459,111,149,195,291,372,441,471,121,155,234,251,327,355,374,418,7,88,99,102,182,361,364,400,444,79,109,146,203,227,402,424,426,458,467,86,125,170,254,288,308,343,360,452,474,1,105,138,319,373,453,463,276,96,106,123,265,331,437,462,18,180,230,107,158,194,339,353,407,410,433,90,104,196,224,321,139,160,191,290,398,209,228,269,456,425,443,128,320,177,215,233,89,270,406,466,19,352,229,454,225,487],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"How can the effectiveness of a dynamic defense strategy be quantitatively assessed, considering both its immediate impact and its long-term adaptability to evolving threats?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[447],"raw_output":"","pred":"The effectiveness of a dynamic defense strategy can be quantitatively assessed through a combination of immediate impact metrics and long-term adaptability indicators. Immediate impact is measured by key metrics such as the interception rate, which quantifies the percentage of successful intercepts out of total invasion attempts. A higher interception rate indicates a more effective defense strategy. Time to neutralize threats, which assesses the average time taken to detect, engage, and neutralize invaders, also contributes to this assessment. Additionally, the integrity of the protected area post-interception evaluates the condition of the area after defense actions, providing insights into the effectiveness of containment efforts.\n\nLong-term adaptability is assessed through metrics like resource efficiency, which measures how effectively resources are utilized to maximize interception rates and minimize response times. The adaptability score reflects the defense system's ability to incorporate lessons learned from past invasions and improve future responses. This score is calculated by dividing the number of adaptations made to new threats by the total number of threats encountered.\n\nBy combining these metrics, a comprehensive evaluation of the defense strategy's effectiveness can be achieved, ensuring that both immediate performance and long-term adaptability are considered. This approach allows for targeted improvements and adjustments to enhance overall security against evolving threats.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[445,447,446,454,39,67,334,465,105,312,139,187,442,81,248,433,437,439,457,102,108,51,93,112,188,415,155,96,260,269,11,45,113,416,83,98,436,450,470,36,37,117,118,256,332,393,207,262,392,474,97,166,178,335,395,432,438,451,245,430,449,17,94,103,333,425,19,60,176,422,458,9,65,251,401,440,448,33,35,72,100,101,193,255,417,429,435,452,466,247,424,76,138,200,41,156,198,441,444,467,66,110,143,394,40,59,88,109,129,242,338,354,397,420,431,104,259,325,434,468,38,95,127,337,426,443,12,58,99,144,270,294,372,376,411,43,61,400,404,27,71,130,252,350,407,456,469,16,44,106,148,179,214,246,257,396,419,428,478,5,15,78,84,87,168,180,240,402,459,29,107,111,282,347,453,460,18,119,73,115,151,234,366,455,353,413,79,211,261,77,91,120,140,141,250,374,472,473,34,56,137,142,414,206,212,236,306,418,85,90,167,201,213,26,186,243,249,356,403,421,464,42,195,461,471,68,89,135,244,336,14,116,232,368,381,149,210,219,235,339,427,24,55,348,373,377,133,192,233,238,343,379,408,258,387,169,190,263,375,410,412,1,23,114,157,209,346,384,483,228,382,399,383,423,463,123,154,199,227,385,52,300,359,50,147,159,160,288,362,406,485,4,57,92,132,48,409,22,370,380,80,122,124,145,208,340,405,202,398,75,128,152,276,319,344,388,134,136,241,345,316,342,371,32,46,70,484,8,63,131,476,10,54,82,21,189,229,239,314,328,358,386,462,479,223,225,341,365,6,7,121,194,283,326,329,158,171,191,215,327,331,486,313,378,30,153,161,196,284,315,317,352,369,126,162,172,216,217,330,349,86,165,253,295,13,267,361,25,220,291,318,363,367,49,174,237,264,297,308,231,296,475,47,221,268,278,285,286,351,390,31,203,289,309,355,477,20,265,266,277,301,302,321,389,164,185,290,310,357,360,481,53,173,204,287,311,364,391,64,163,224,271,272,273,299,320,480,183,218,222,298,170,181,184,205,150,226,303,28,182,292,307,487,279,482,3,293,125,197,322,323,254,304,177,280,324,274,281,305,69,275,175,2,62,230,146,74],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This is crucial because PPG and ECG cycles often do not perfectly align, making it difficult to construct optimal and exact sample pairs for translation.\n\nThe alignment scores (αt,i) play a central role in this process. They are calculated based on how well each input segment (xi) matches the output segment (yt) at each time step (t). Specifically, αt,i is defined as the exponential of the alignment function s, which measures the similarity between the input and output segments. This function is parameterized by the latent state zt−1, ensuring that the model considers the context from previous time steps.\n\nBy assigning higher weights (αt,i) to input segments that better match the output, the attention mechanism effectively adds more context to the generation of ECG segments.

{"question":"How do the challenges of aligning continuous modalities differ from those of aligning discrete modalities, and what specific techniques are employed to address these unique challenges in continuous alignment?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[50],"raw_output":"","pred":"The primary challenge in aligning continuous modalities lies in the absence of readily available segmentation, unlike discrete modalities where clear boundaries exist (e.g., words in speech or object regions in images). Continuous signals, such as financial time-series, spatiotemporal data, or MRI images, lack inherent segmentation, making it difficult to identify corresponding elements across modalities.\n\nTo address these challenges, continuous alignment employs two main techniques: continuous warping and modality segmentation. Continuous warping involves representing continuous signals as continuous representation spaces and aligning them through a bridging mechanism. This technique is particularly useful for aligning continuous audio and video data, where adversarial training is a popular approach. Adversarial training learns a domain-invariant representation across different domains, making it effective for multimodal alignment tasks.\n\nModality segmentation, on the other hand, involves dividing high-dimensional data into elements with semantically meaningful boundaries. This technique is crucial for temporal segmentation, where the goal is to discover temporal boundaries across sequential data. Techniques like forced alignment, factored hidden Markov models, and clustering are employed to achieve this. For instance, clustering approaches group continuous data based on semantic similarity, which is essential for preprocessing tasks like generalizing language-based pretraining to video or audio-based pretraining.\n\nIn summary, continuous alignment tackles the unique challenge of aligning signals without clear segmentation by leveraging continuous warping and modality segmentation techniques, ensuring accurate and meaningful alignment across different modalities.","source":"data/test/2404.18976.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,50,37,44,13,118,6,146,12,28,38,121,136,174,24,11,126,3,45,57,43,30,25,51,27,122,16,52,123,138,60,172,18,42,92,102,125,137,36,54,58,116,20,41,62,81,150,155,170,53,117,195,32,49,90,143,168,183,191,202,77,173,34,40,56,107,188,61,63,108,159,7,175,139,147,171,31,46,64,66,156,9,87,111,112,153,209,69,74,75,85,120,127,162,187,19,93,151,154,164,206,15,29,89,59,131,72,109,157,177,68,78,94,103,114,152,180,200,21,67,70,86,124,134,22,73,106,119,133,189,14,181,194,47,79,80,128,149,160,193,201,207,113,132,161,165,176,197,26,35,65,95,210,5,88,182,184,33,55,71,91,115,141,148,190,203,17,96,104,144,166,167,179,192,196,211,213,99,178,204,23,98,100,101,105,198,205,39,145,158,185,214,83,130,140,208,142,199,84,169,135,163,212,82,4,76,110,129,8,2,186,97,10,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Specifically, the correlation between S and performance drop is ρ = 0.73, whereas the correlation between R and performance drop is ρ = 0.01.

{"question":"Given the context of magnetically programmed modules for stochastic self-assembly, how might the concepts of \"local\" and \"global\" agnosticism (as described for Hadamard matrices) be applied to a different encoding scheme, and what trade-offs might be involved in choosing one scheme over another?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[14],"raw_output":"","pred":"The concepts of \"local\" and \"global\" agnosticism can be applied to any encoding scheme for stochastic self-assembly, not just Hadamard matrices.  \"Local\" agnosticism ensures that mating faces attract only in one configuration, while \"global\" agnosticism ensures non-mating faces attract in no configuration.\n\nFor example, in a binary encoding scheme, \"local\" agnosticism could be achieved by ensuring that each face has a unique pattern of 1s and 0s, so that only faces with matching patterns attract.  \"Global\" agnosticism could be enforced by ensuring that no two faces have the same pattern, preventing any attraction between non-mating faces.\n\nChoosing between Hadamard and binary encoding schemes involves trade-offs.  Hadamard matrices offer a larger number of unique encodings (2^N^2 for an N x N matrix) compared to binary encoding (2^N for an N x N matrix). This allows for more complex structures to be programmed. However, Hadamard matrices are more complex to generate and may require more sophisticated programming techniques.

This would enable the system to handle components with a mass greater than 65g, such as larger batteries or more complex electronic modules. Secondly, reducing the nozzle diameter could increase the precision and stability of the pick-and-place process, allowing for the handling of smaller components like SMD resistors down to size 2010. This would enhance the system's versatility and reduce the risk of component damage during the pick-and-place process.\n\nAdditionally, upgrading the pump to a stronger suction mechanism could increase the lifting capacity, allowing for the handling of taller components, such as rotors, without exceeding the current height limit of 27mm.

{"question":"How does the observed discrepancy between the predicted and measured repulsive forces in the magnetic interaction experiment relate to the concept of coercivity, and what adjustments were made to the model to account for this discrepancy?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[97],"raw_output":"","pred":"The observed discrepancy between the predicted and measured repulsive forces in the magnetic interaction experiment can be attributed to the concept of coercivity. Coercivity refers to the magnetic field strength required to reverse the magnetization of a material. In the context of this experiment, the measured repulsive forces were weaker than those predicted by correlating the matrix values. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that when two attractive magnetic dipoles are brought into contact, they reinforce their attractive alignments, leading to stronger attraction. However, repulsive dipoles, if free to rotate, will realign to an attractive equilibrium, which may be facilitated by the low coercivity of the soft magnetic faces used in the experiment.\n\nTo account for this effect, the researchers implemented a scaling factor of 0.09 to the repulsive forces predicted by correlation. This scaling factor normalizes the magnitude of the repulsive pixels to those in attraction, thereby adjusting the model to better match the measured results. The normalized sum of squared differences between the measured and predicted results using this scaling factor was found to be 0.014, indicating a good fit and supporting the model as an accurate predictor of force between magnetically programmed faces.","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[98,15,96,97,70,99,71,72,36,13,85,100,101,26,94,29,63,84,95,9,103,27,64,44,62,86,28,60,65,92,112,68,107,110,49,35,90,50,105,41,69,83,106,109,61,67,125,122,119,14,42,8,87,128,54,57,88,108,120,25,33,89,118,12,43,76,78,93,104,45,113,124,2,5,34,48,4,24,77,80,121,30,91,123,75,116,10,18,59,81,102,117,126,6,16,82,3,58,74,127,11,22,37,47,56,66,21,39,111,20,38,32,46,55,73,7,1,114,53,19,52,115,23,17,51,31,79,40],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

With a larger initialization scale (1e-2), the reconstruction error decreases rapidly, reaching a low value quickly, but the convergence is not as smooth as with smaller initialization scales. The component norms also show a faster movement, indicating a more aggressive learning process. However, with smaller initialization scales (1e-3, 1e-4), the convergence is slower, and the reconstruction error decreases more gradually. The component norms move more slowly, suggesting a more controlled and incremental learning process.\n\nFor the 8x8x8x8 (order 4) tensor completion problem, the trends are similar but more pronounced.

The smaller initialization scales (1e-3, 1e-4) result in slower but more stable convergence, with smoother changes in component norms.\n\nThe observed effects can be explained by the dynamics of gradient descent. With larger initialization scales, the initial components are more significant, leading to faster convergence but potentially unstable learning. Smaller initialization scales allow for more controlled learning, resulting in slower but more stable convergence.

The figure shows an input tensor \\( X \\) being processed through a hidden layer that consists of a 1x1 convolution and global pooling operations.\n\n1. **1x1 Convolution**: This operation is analogous to the 1x1 convolution in a standard convolutional neural network (CNN). In a CNN, 1x1 convolutions are used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps. Similarly, in tensor factorization, the 1x1 convolution takes the input tensor \\( X \\) and applies a set of learnable filters \\( W \\) to produce a set of feature maps. Each filter \\( w_r \\) is applied to the input tensor, resulting in a set of activations \\( \\langle w_r^{(n)}, x_n \\rangle \\) for each channel \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Global Pooling**: This operation is analogous to the global pooling in a CNN, which aggregates the activations across the spatial dimensions. In tensor factorization, global pooling computes the product of all activations in each channel \\( r \\), effectively reducing the dimensionality of the feature maps. This step introduces a polynomial non-linearity into the model, as the product of the activations is not linear.\n\nThe output of the hidden layer is then reduced through summation to a scalar, which is the final output of the network. This process can be seen as a tensor factorization, where the input tensor is decomposed into a sum of components, each combining \\( N \\) vectors through the tensor product operator.

Specifically, it allows us to express \\( |w_{1,1}| \\) in terms of \\( \\min\\{|z|, |z'|\\}^2 \\), which is crucial for the subsequent steps in the derivation. This simplification is leveraged to establish a tighter bound on \\( \\rho_1(W_M) \\) and subsequently on \\( \\rho_2(W_M) \\).\n\nTo remove this assumption and establish a bound that holds for all loss values, the derivation proceeds by considering the limit of the bound as \\( LM(W_M) \\) approaches the minimum of \\( z^2/8 \\) and \\( z'^2/8 \\). This limit analysis ensures that the derived bound remains valid even when \\( LM(W_M) \\) is not strictly less than the minimum of \\( z^2/8 \\) and \\( z'^2/8 \\). By carefully handling the limits and ensuring that the bounds are consistent across different loss values, the proof establishes a universal upper bound for the effective rank that does not rely on the initial assumption. This approach guarantees that the derived bound is applicable regardless of the specific loss value, thereby providing a robust and general result.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[115,103,104,101,100,116,17,112,16,48,170,102,111,114,132,113,169,129,136,162,166,168,164,135,15,19,138,159,194,139,14,125,140,107,161,63,106,133,155,137,167,188,44,46,197,30,156,49,143,200,47,165,28,31,45,105,198,39,64,171,108,130,201,126,151,152,96,99,134,186,20,94,98,160,65,192,109,122,38,163,118,127,145,172,174,196,203,53,88,158,173,195,18,29,78,22,123,144,189,193,131,119,141,199,12,181,187,92,202,182,90,117,154,205,8,37,42,157,11,50,79,21,60,68,74,128,4,110,204,76,153,191,121,13,23,124,82,95,120,3,5,7,190,34,41,43,91,97,25,26,27,77,10,147,59,67,70,35,52,85,146,185,33,36,58,69,184,206,24,40,62,54,71,81,150,93,9,32,80,84,86,89,57,75,175,176,178,87,180,66,142,179,183,148,55,177,72,149,83,51,1,61,2,56,73,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}
{"question":"How does the choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) influence the network's ability to model interactions between vertices, and what are the implications of using a product aggregation operator in this context?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[61],"raw_output":"","pred":"The choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) significantly influences the network's ability to model interactions between vertices. In a GNN, the AGGREGATE function combines the hidden embeddings of a vertex's neighbors to update its own embedding. This aggregation step is crucial as it determines how information from neighboring vertices is integrated into the central vertex's representation.\n\nWhen the AGGREGATE function is a product aggregation operator, it allows the GNN to model interactions between vertices in a polynomial manner. Specifically, the product aggregation operator combines the hidden embeddings of neighboring vertices by taking their element-wise product. This means that the updated embedding of a vertex is a polynomial function of its neighbors' embeddings, which can capture more complex interactions than simple sums or averages.\n\nThe implications of using a product aggregation operator are profound. It enables the GNN to model higher-order interactions, which are essential for capturing intricate relationships within the graph. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where the relationships between entities are not linear but involve more complex dependencies. By allowing polynomial interactions, the GNN can better approximate a wider range of functions, enhancing its expressiveness and potentially improving its performance in tasks that require modeling complex graph structures.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,62,57,172,60,58,177,5,175,176,64,180,173,179,9,59,178,186,3,65,63,71,174,74,67,204,86,76,142,203,202,68,69,72,79,82,78,84,53,4,196,40,8,41,80,85,77,81,144,184,190,23,25,183,83,187,182,7,35,193,87,88,181,13,27,50,75,167,39,89,36,70,147,33,26,52,205,14,92,21,22,42,195,11,185,54,141,188,96,24,44,66,146,38,206,12,29,32,51,189,95,56,197,55,143,148,151,149,191,100,199,132,16,49,20,119,121,122,128,47,109,159,43,105,18,37,171,201,19,150,192,34,90,94,125,133,138,30,48,111,170,198,46,17,91,15,97,158,45,120,126,200,93,194,10,168,118,145,156,2,31,103,104,164,1,153,161,28,108,110,129,154,163,98,160,123,112,169,106,107,130,134,135,139,115,131,124,137,152,113,116,136,140,162,155,127,157,99,101,165,114,166,102,117,6,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The village's location in the uMgungundlovu district, which is predominantly Zulu by tribe, suggests a cultural and agricultural focus on farming and livestock keeping.\n\nIn comparison, Mbeere District in Kenya, as depicted in the map, is situated between latitude 0° 20’ and 0° 50’ South and longitude 37°16’ and 37°56’ East, covering an area of 2,097 square kilometres.

For CHiME6, the DER is 27.76% for the 8 kHz model and 26.82% for the 16 kHz model, resulting in a difference of 0.94%.\n\nThis large discrepancy can likely be attributed to the fact that CHiME6 is a far-field dataset, which typically presents more challenging conditions for diarization tasks. Far-field recordings often have lower signal-to-noise ratios, more background noise, and less precise localization of speakers, making it harder for diarization systems to accurately identify and separate individual speakers.\n\nThe 16 kHz model, which has a higher sampling rate and potentially more detailed frequency information, may be better suited to handle the increased complexity and noise in far-field conditions. This allows it to achieve a lower DER compared to the 8 kHz model, which may struggle with the finer details and spectral information required for accurate diarization in such challenging scenarios.\n\nOverall, the larger discrepancy for CHiME6 highlights the importance of using models that can effectively capture and utilize high-frequency information in far-field environments to improve diarization performance.","source":"data/test/2407.08752.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[73,44,93,69,43,108,109,42,95,106,107,110,111,68,70,89,41,76,90,92,104,103,35,98,105,37,87,100,94,74,91,38,67,88,16,15,23,2,102,60,99,40,71,24,25,55,96,46,66,75,114,14,26,59,78,80,138,72,11,101,112,97,4,12,27,131,86,45,61,36,84,19,22,130,30,3,39,21,51,124,5,31,34,18,113,8,17,65,120,28,137,117,123,47,50,52,58,125,136,119,57,127,135,62,132,13,54,79,10,49,118,122,126,64,116,48,133,20,115,121,63,129,1,134,29,32,128,82,81,83,56,85,53,33,77,6,7,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

{"question":"What is the significance of the join inverse rig structure in the categorical interpretation of the programming language introduced in §4.2, and how does it relate to the concept of adequacy between operational and denotational semantics?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[142],"raw_output":"","pred":"The join inverse rig structure plays a crucial role in the categorical interpretation of the programming language introduced in §4.2. This structure allows for the definition of iso abstractions and pattern-matching, which are essential for ensuring reversibility in the language. The DCPO (directed-complete partial order) enrichment of the category further enables the consideration of recursive isos and inductive data types, which are represented using parameterized initial algebras. This enriched structure provides a robust framework for the language's semantics.\n\nThe significance of this categorical interpretation is underscored by its adequacy with respect to the operational semantics of the language. Adequacy is a critical property that ensures the denotational semantics accurately reflects the operational behavior of the language. In this context, the adequacy theorem (Theorem 4.29) states that a term is terminating in the operational semantics if and only if its interpretation in the denotational semantics is not the bottom element (01,JAK). This theorem establishes a strong link between the operational and denotational semantics, ensuring that the denotational model correctly captures the computational behavior of the language. The proof of adequacy involves a syntactic approach, inspired by previous work, which demonstrates the correspondence between the two levels of abstraction in the language.","source":"data/test/2406.07216.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[142,45,136,18,108,141,42,127,44,156,3,128,140,173,43,109,125,91,147,33,135,138,10,149,155,144,158,29,129,11,111,130,132,139,49,180,39,126,92,94,22,78,117,120,131,148,30,137,160,17,119,47,61,118,133,143,151,16,25,32,72,79,89,154,70,74,159,169,181,21,95,75,90,123,9,150,107,115,80,122,174,40,101,23,41,71,85,84,26,38,52,59,164,177,56,93,152,13,67,113,134,20,55,116,161,31,112,145,157,179,77,105,121,167,37,46,57,73,99,110,166,15,58,2,14,66,68,88,98,28,82,96,102,162,175,81,146,50,168,178,24,171,1,60,83,176,53,62,97,100,104,165,34,69,19,106,183,184,35,163,36,48,76,182,153,5,114,27,87,51,63,103,64,172,65,6,7,4,8,12,54,86,124,170],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This uniqueness is crucial for the well-definition and typing of Dup∅A as stated in Lemma 4.52 for several reasons:\n\n1. **Well-definition**: The uniqueness ensures that the duplication process is deterministic. For any given free-variable X, there is only one corresponding ϕ that can be used to duplicate values of type A. This prevents ambiguity in the duplication process, ensuring that the same free-variable always maps to the same ϕ, which is essential for the consistency and predictability of the duplication operation.\n\n2. **Well-typedness**: The uniqueness of ϕ ensures that the resulting duplication iso is well-typed. Each ϕ is associated with a specific type, and the duplication process respects these types. This means that the duplication operation can be correctly applied to values of type A, and the resulting duplication iso is of type A ↔ A ⊗ A, as required by Lemma 4.52.\n\n3. **Correctness**: The uniqueness of ϕ ensures that the duplication process is correct and reliable. It guarantees that the duplication operation behaves as expected for all values of type A, maintaining the integrity of the type system and ensuring that the duplication iso is valid and useful for further computations.\n\nIn summary, the uniqueness of ϕ for each free-variable X ensures that the duplication process is deterministic, well-defined, and well-typed, which is essential for the correctness and reliability of the duplication operation in the context of the given lemma.","source":"data/test/2406.07216.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[150,139,136,154,132,31,140,148,166,131,129,138,80,116,162,106,134,151,113,137,149,167,43,120,141,38,40,42,82,143,95,165,169,100,110,115,133,163,164,84,168,39,41,44,47,83,98,108,109,111,112,118,147,27,79,81,142,145,121,161,37,97,107,26,29,36,61,68,96,104,130,30,63,102,105,49,67,75,119,144,155,45,60,74,101,135,152,46,59,66,153,28,77,78,128,50,71,93,114,160,32,35,51,94,33,34,70,73,146,158,99,58,117,21,53,91,159,52,22,90,57,76,11,72,122,25,62,126,64,85,178,16,56,92,174,10,23,69,15,175,65,180,9,157,183,127,176,177,17,182,184,20,89,156,88,125,18,24,55,103,13,14,48,181,5,173,179,171,87,1,172,2,19,7,123,3,6,4,8,12,54,86,124,170],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Here's how:\n\n1. The spaces A and Z are topological (X × X)-translation spaces, meaning they have a topology that respects translations in the X × X product space.\n\n2. The extension π is defined on the product space A × {Tτc : τ ∈X × X}, where A is a subset of X and {Tτc : τ ∈X × X} is a set of translations.\n\n3. The key step is to show that π is continuous on this product space. To do this, we consider a sequence (ai, Tτic)i≥1 convergent to (a, Tτc).\n\n4. By using the properties of π being translation equivariant (TE) and the fact that c is diagonally translation invariant and anti-diagonal discriminating, we can manipulate the sequence as follows:\n\n   π(ai, Tτic) = π(ai, Tτi,⊥c) = Tτi,⊥π(T−τi,⊥ai, c) = Tτi,⊥π(T−τi,⊥ai, c)\n\n5. Since (τi,⊥)i≥1 is convergent and (τ, a) 7→T−τa and (τ, z) 7→Tτz are continuous, we can take the limit as i→∞:\n\n   lim i→∞π(ai, Tτic) = Tτ⊥π(T−τ⊥ai, c) = π(a, Tτc)\n\n6. This shows that π is continuous on the product space A × {Tτc : τ ∈X × X}, as required.\n\nThe continuity of A and Z allows us to leverage the properties of π and the translations to prove its continuity on the product space.","source":"data/test/2408.09583.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[208,207,75,81,54,78,84,83,79,187,188,191,206,37,74,57,203,204,77,96,189,36,72,82,192,199,212,216,159,202,205,44,45,56,73,60,94,201,209,42,64,65,80,97,38,55,62,76,158,210,16,61,195,196,213,41,51,52,63,211,214,215,198,102,53,59,190,68,193,67,89,98,43,58,90,93,99,91,150,194,92,160,39,200,17,106,219,95,104,18,50,66,88,186,22,27,49,169,223,15,103,176,25,115,87,217,71,180,220,147,226,28,85,137,173,185,197,35,178,182,181,26,30,114,139,19,24,138,157,175,218,5,105,179,166,145,29,47,86,101,142,162,174,23,183,184,225,40,46,70,146,170,109,129,130,172,177,110,113,111,221,31,32,144,149,151,116,4,34,48,120,123,156,6,124,154,164,167,33,107,136,155,168,13,108,121,161,20,69,163,8,9,222,112,141,140,135,153,171,12,117,122,119,128,152,7,118,127,134,148,126,133,100,2,3,21,143,1,125,165,11,10,14,131,132,224],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

In scenarios with a higher proportion of latency-sensitive tasks, the system must prioritize these tasks to ensure timely processing, which can lead to improved user satisfaction and reduced latency.

{"question":"What are the limitations of using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (ITSC) systems, and how do these limitations impact the model's performance in dynamic and data-scarce environments?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[37],"raw_output":"","pred":"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in Intelligent Traffic Signal Control (ITSC) systems face several limitations that impact their performance in dynamic and data-scarce environments. HMMs assume that the underlying system follows the Markov property, meaning that the probability of transitioning to a new state depends only on the current state and not on the past states. This assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, particularly in dynamic environments where the system's behavior can be influenced by a long history of states and observations. For instance, in ITSC, traffic congestion can build up gradually, and the system's behavior may depend on the traffic conditions experienced over an extended period. Additionally, HMMs heavily rely on sufficient training data to estimate model parameters accurately. In situations where data is scarce or noisy, the performance of HMMs may be compromised. Furthermore, HMMs may struggle with rare events that are not well-represented in the training data. For example, during peak hours, traffic congestion can build up gradually, and the system's behavior may depend on the traffic conditions experienced over an extended period. In a newly developed neighborhood with limited historical traffic data, HMMs may struggle to accurately estimate the underlying traffic patterns and model parameters. These limitations highlight the need for more robust and adaptable models in ITSC systems to handle dynamic and data-scarce environments effectively.","source":"data/test/2405.17691.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,36,39,43,56,38,44,45,62,210,213,40,55,5,52,42,58,47,139,18,41,137,53,22,49,50,152,30,214,13,34,61,239,20,21,46,64,151,240,24,51,48,32,65,219,228,140,148,224,113,66,14,117,215,226,35,105,115,235,67,155,206,225,3,68,59,230,8,57,156,161,233,80,110,81,138,207,141,236,31,220,221,222,25,234,63,157,164,19,237,4,198,17,26,60,160,218,229,9,75,180,227,232,153,205,231,116,144,201,203,208,73,204,163,191,23,74,103,196,238,149,162,165,188,209,101,159,33,166,2,10,193,197,200,150,154,183,168,7,106,217,223,28,6,29,69,142,211,78,79,98,178,212,11,100,16,54,158,174,173,192,145,111,172,70,90,118,119,184,167,189,202,130,88,89,186,135,169,179,187,194,176,199,27,120,132,143,216,72,136,171,122,112,175,104,170,91,102,185,190,134,114,121,83,87,124,195,97,126,177,241,109,86,93,107,99,127,71,182,77,94,1,96,85,123,128,181,82,108,129,133,146,125,95,76,84,147,131,92,15,12],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The text notes that while constrained margins have high CMI values for some tasks, suggesting inherent difficulty in generalization prediction, the resulting scatter plots of mean constrained margin vs. test accuracy do not show points in the lower right (large margin but low generalization) or upper left (small margin but high generalization) quadrants. This implies that a larger mean constrained margin is generally beneficial to a model's generalization, but may not always fully describe its performance.\n\nThis limitation relates to the field of adversarial examples in that it suggests margin-based measures may not capture the subtle differences in model robustness that adversarial examples highlight. Adversarial examples are perturbed samples that appear visually similar to normal samples but are consistently misclassified by DNNs. The text notes that adversarial examples exist despite the high linearity of DNNs, which is often attributed to the models' sensitivity to small perturbations. If margin-based measures were more sensitive to these subtle variations, they might better predict the existence and impact of adversarial examples.

While uniform sampling provides a more even coverage of the space, Gaussian sampling concentrates points closer to the origin, potentially leading to more concentrated adversarial examples.\n\nHowever, this comes at the cost of computational efficiency.  Generating Gaussian samples requires more complex calculations than uniform samples, which are simply drawn from a uniform distribution.  The trade-off is significant in high-dimensional spaces like ImageNet, where the computational cost of generating Gaussian samples can be substantial.\n\nTherefore, in adversarial machine learning, the choice of sampling method depends on the specific requirements of the task.  If computational efficiency is paramount, uniform sampling might be preferred.  If finding adversarial examples that are concentrated near the decision boundary is crucial, Gaussian sampling is likely more effective, despite the increased computational cost.  The optimal approach may involve a combination of both methods, using uniform sampling for initial exploration and Gaussian sampling for fine-tuning the search for adversarial examples.\n","source":"data/test/2407.11029v1.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[161,160,157,55,84,145,154,158,62,51,155,83,9,70,105,111,61,14,73,53,74,15,16,60,40,54,64,69,156,72,77,79,138,136,189,63,49,52,39,109,56,144,87,92,113,57,65,128,71,181,37,38,85,132,137,45,118,171,177,184,188,12,78,115,141,195,13,59,190,75,76,104,133,135,10,29,134,21,44,46,112,116,194,43,123,131,183,7,143,168,107,176,22,41,90,97,8,48,50,82,140,148,182,31,68,108,149,187,27,28,110,139,142,146,153,165,5,173,102,129,130,93,11,20,120,127,152,17,32,58,163,170,180,91,23,47,80,89,94,122,185,192,4,42,169,30,81,88,103,172,186,193,124,174,121,67,191,18,117,179,33,95,159,167,114,34,106,6,24,26,125,66,119,147,25,86,101,1,36,178,162,96,35,126,164,100,151,175,150,98,99,166,19,2,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

In contrast, for FMNIST, the distribution is shifted to the left, with a mean of 0.94, indicating that the test data points have a lower projection onto the training gradient space.

By analyzing the projection of test data onto the training gradient space, one can detect data points that do not fit well with the model's learned patterns, which are likely to be OOD data.

The context suggests that networks with more parameters are more likely to exhibit decision boundaries with more curvature, which may explain why adversarial examples become less persistent as network complexity increases.\n\n5. The table also shows that for simpler networks (FC10-4, FC10-2, FC10-0), the attack distortion is so high that the resulting adversarial images are often more stable than natural images. This is reflected in the persist (Adv) values being higher than persist (Nat) for these networks.\n\nOverall, the relationship indicates that more complex networks are more vulnerable to adversarial attacks, requiring less distortion to achieve a successful attack, but also exhibit less persistence in their adversarial examples compared to simpler networks.","source":"data/test/2407.11029v1.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[72,71,69,156,16,154,44,8,58,54,46,60,84,55,40,62,75,9,15,21,61,83,76,158,85,48,70,74,43,59,39,82,52,73,56,68,143,157,5,17,155,41,49,145,142,50,23,45,14,18,38,10,113,51,105,177,189,4,78,190,7,138,176,79,22,42,144,181,47,53,63,192,77,87,118,20,180,160,186,179,152,129,182,188,194,86,25,153,172,80,171,193,92,187,103,137,97,122,174,12,88,94,112,106,111,173,110,57,109,27,93,170,32,13,81,139,184,66,128,146,168,31,130,133,134,165,127,147,195,108,115,136,148,95,107,123,91,117,120,124,167,6,29,90,125,149,185,28,140,178,175,1,65,67,102,114,26,37,89,116,119,131,132,169,104,191,135,161,33,96,11,24,34,101,30,35,121,183,64,164,36,141,159,162,150,163,98,166,99,126,151,19,2,100,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

For example, α is set to 0.05 and β to 1 for PEP8 finetuning, while for toxicity pretraining, α is 0.0 and β is 10.\n\n5. Across training phases, the hyperparameters for AWR remain relatively consistent, with only minor adjustments in some cases.\n\n6. For finetuning, the learning rate is slightly higher (1·10^-4) compared to pretraining (5·10^-4).\n\n7. The batch size for finetuning is larger (512 tokens) compared to pretraining (64 tokens).\n\nThese trends suggest that AWR uses a lower learning rate and larger batch sizes compared to MLE, with specific alpha and beta values tailored to different tasks and training phases. The absence of temperature for AWR indicates it may be less sensitive to this parameter compared to other objectives. Overall, AWR appears to be a robust objective that can be applied across different tasks and training phases with some fine-tuning of hyperparameters.","source":"data/test/2404.12150.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[110,71,107,66,72,69,113,106,112,67,68,111,59,41,73,62,70,60,7,74,10,8,86,63,36,93,108,15,61,5,58,16,57,65,104,131,14,134,27,77,105,114,123,78,103,25,50,51,17,39,54,34,49,75,136,13,21,43,64,45,121,20,24,19,47,52,29,32,127,6,48,122,147,26,31,55,84,94,148,23,37,140,11,138,18,95,144,28,76,96,116,129,35,124,22,120,128,143,44,85,132,87,119,125,42,53,102,130,135,139,118,97,146,33,38,56,115,9,98,12,142,141,117,40,133,30,81,126,82,46,99,101,89,91,109,80,90,137,2,79,1,3,83,145,88,92,100,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This baseline is subtracted from the reward to center the advantage around zero, which helps with variance reduction.\n\nIn DPGoff (off-policy), the baseline is Z * πθ(x)/q(x). This is an importance-weighted baseline that corrects for the bias introduced by sampling from a different distribution q instead of πθ. The key difference is that this baseline is calculated using the importance weight πθ(x)/q(x), which accounts for the difference between the sampling distribution q and the target policy πθ.\n\nThe importance weight is crucial in DPGoff because it allows the baseline to adapt to the target policy, even when sampling from a different distribution. This is what enables DPGoff to maintain unbiased gradient estimates even when using an off-policy sampling distribution.\n\nThe importance-weighted baseline in DPGoff is more complex to calculate than the simple baseline in DPG, but it is necessary to maintain unbiasedness in the off-policy setting.

Google Translate, while capable of handling many translations, may not capture these subtleties as effectively.\n\nOverall, the fine-tuned MLLM model's higher BLEU score indicates a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation, likely due to its specialized training and deeper understanding of the language.","source":"data/test/2403.01580.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[192,54,103,104,105,109,111,182,58,152,195,25,82,194,53,113,170,46,49,70,185,224,16,161,187,26,31,32,39,92,17,171,191,19,86,206,6,78,72,73,96,100,149,35,67,87,153,4,63,64,223,226,5,40,57,110,180,41,200,159,179,193,15,18,84,88,3,68,163,181,38,214,219,160,205,71,8,177,216,47,122,151,81,155,196,12,33,34,65,102,1,52,128,167,202,221,69,85,220,30,112,115,28,29,45,56,183,189,62,148,60,156,74,176,48,99,50,51,229,90,162,204,116,188,107,197,24,43,80,154,136,168,203,61,135,77,93,157,173,174,184,217,158,166,10,22,91,106,123,37,97,165,169,209,14,228,227,11,21,178,199,231,55,232,27,147,198,137,190,218,42,101,138,79,133,139,140,186,59,143,210,215,23,44,89,130,132,150,164,230,172,175,213,118,211,141,212,222,127,207,124,98,13,225,83,142,9,95,134,36,201,120,144,117,126,129,119,66,108,7,20,94,131,208,75,121,145,114,146,76,125,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The key challenge is identifiability:  without supervision, it's difficult to determine if learned representations are equivalent.  Independent mechanism analysis provides a constraint on the mixing function, promoting identifiability of independent latents.\n\nMulti-view causal representation learning (Chapter 4) deals with non-independent paired data, aiming to identify invariant content variables (Layer 3).  The challenge here is block-identifiability, the recovery of a group of variables up to an invertible mapping.  The invariant block of latents shared across views can be identified, providing a partial solution to the identifiability problem.\n\nMulti-environment causal representation learning (Chapter 5) tackles non-identically distributed data from multiple datasets, arising from unknown interventions (Layer 2).

This means that genres that have been listened to frequently and recently will have a higher activation level, leading to higher rankings.\n\nHowever, the right panel of Figure 2.1 introduces associative activation, which takes into account the strength of associations between genres. This is represented by the weights \\( W_c \\) and the association strengths \\( S_{c,g} \\). The associative activation adjusts the base-level activation based on the current context, such as the music genres that are relevant in the current situation.\n\nThe inclusion of associative activation can lead to a different ranking of genres because it considers not just the frequency and recency of usage but also how well the genre is associated with the current context.

By considering the associative activation, the system can provide more relevant and personalized recommendations. For instance, if a user has just listened to a popular genre, the system might recommend other genres that are strongly associated with that genre, even if they are not the most frequently listened to.

In NLG, typicality refers to sequences that are not much more or less likely to be observed than an average sequence. This concept is crucial because it helps identify sequences that are not representative of the overall distribution of possible outputs.\n\nThe bad mode problem arises when the most likely attribute value (e.g., the most common sequence length) does not align with the attribute value of the most likely string. This mismatch can occur because the distribution of sequences is not uniform, and some sequences are more likely to be generated than others due to various factors such as the structure of the language, the context, or the training data.\n\nAtypicality, or sequences that are less likely to be observed, can sometimes be beneficial. For instance, in text generation, using atypical sequences can lead to more diverse and creative outputs, which might be desirable in tasks requiring originality or novelty. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the goal is to generate text that is not just representative but also innovative or expressive.

{"question":"How can self-attention mechanisms be leveraged to improve the interpretability and effectiveness of video summarization models, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies and hierarchical relationships within video sequences?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[121],"raw_output":"","pred":"Self-attention mechanisms can significantly enhance video summarization models by capturing long-range dependencies and hierarchical relationships within video sequences. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle with capturing long-range dependencies due to their sequential nature and limited receptive field. In contrast, self-attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, enabling it to learn long-range dependencies effectively.\n\nIn video summarization, self-attention can be applied to each frame or segment of the video, allowing the model to attend to relevant frames across the entire sequence. This mechanism helps in identifying key frames that are crucial for understanding the overall context and meaning of the video. By attending to these key frames, the model can generate more accurate and informative summaries.\n\nMoreover, self-attention can capture hierarchical relationships within the video content. For instance, it can distinguish between main events and supporting details, or identify the importance of different actors or objects in the video. This hierarchical understanding is crucial for creating summaries that are not only concise but also meaningful and coherent.\n\nOverall, self-attention mechanisms improve the interpretability of video summarization models by providing a more nuanced understanding of the video content, leading to more effective and informative summaries.","source":"data/test/2408.14743.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[121,72,18,49,91,17,126,46,66,50,74,48,73,24,75,26,47,61,43,67,88,108,85,90,96,117,87,115,20,25,127,69,92,105,45,94,100,109,110,111,16,114,128,14,44,118,9,22,97,125,3,23,124,56,82,93,132,15,70,95,107,129,10,53,89,4,51,120,19,83,52,71,113,106,40,104,112,119,27,31,41,42,98,99,11,57,131,76,122,62,123,5,133,21,54,84,102,135,28,12,60,116,8,68,2,7,136,34,58,63,137,13,30,32,79,39,101,103,1,33,81,6,37,130,64,35,36,59,86,65,55,134,29,80,77,38,78],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The plots show that the value gained is higher when the estimation noise is reduced, as indicated by the smaller error bars and the higher mean values. Specifically, scenarios with lower estimation noise (e.g., (0.4%)², (0.6%)²) tend to show higher gains compared to those with higher noise (e.g., (1%)², (0.8%)²).

This is a fundamental concept in hypothesis testing, as it represents the threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis based on the observed data.\n\nType I errors occur when we incorrectly conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when there is none. This can happen due to random variation in the data or other factors. The significance level helps control the probability of making a Type I error, with smaller values of α (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) providing more stringent criteria for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nIt's important to note that the significance level is a property of the statistical test itself, rather than the data. It is set by the researcher before conducting the test and is used to determine the critical value for rejecting the null hypothesis.

{"question":"How does changing the lengthscale parameter ψ in the random Fourier basis affect the smoothness and flexibility of the generated functions compared to the affine basis? Explain the relationship between ψ and the model's ability to fit different types of data.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[28],"raw_output":"","pred":"The lengthscale parameter ψ in the random Fourier basis significantly affects the smoothness and flexibility of the generated functions compared to the affine basis. In the affine basis, the functions are linear combinations of a single linear weight and a bias, which results in a straight line or plane. This model is highly constrained and can only fit data that is linearly separable.\n\nIn contrast, the random Fourier basis uses a set of cosine functions with random frequency and phase, represented by ϕs,r(x). The lengthscale parameter ψ controls the smoothness of these functions. A larger ψ value leads to smoother functions, as the model places more weight on functions with lower frequency components. This results in a more flexible model that can fit a wider range of data, including non-linear relationships.\n\nConversely, a smaller ψ value leads to more flexible functions with higher frequency components, allowing the model to capture more complex patterns in the data. However, this increased flexibility comes at the cost of requiring more data to accurately estimate the parameters, as the model's uncertainty is higher.\n\nThe relationship between ψ and the model's ability to fit different types of data is thus inversely proportional: larger ψ values are better for fitting smooth, linear data, while smaller ψ values are better for fitting complex, non-linear data. This trade-off between smoothness and flexibility is crucial in determining the appropriate choice of ψ for a given dataset.","source":"data/test/2404.19157.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[29,28,30,50,51,33,32,47,36,96,26,10,31,39,40,69,43,204,25,54,105,57,175,98,176,198,115,153,53,35,62,72,100,108,123,52,34,120,135,165,38,139,155,224,112,122,46,58,59,93,101,113,119,128,133,142,194,110,114,141,149,44,127,148,150,151,97,106,136,137,177,201,19,55,64,71,84,88,95,158,180,41,107,156,169,173,181,183,27,70,79,104,131,174,185,222,18,68,74,77,82,130,134,143,152,171,197,12,37,67,94,125,144,48,103,154,160,167,199,203,219,42,102,138,145,146,147,164,193,65,66,124,126,170,178,208,220,49,56,129,159,163,192,223,233,9,20,61,140,157,179,186,210,216,45,73,75,80,87,92,162,172,213,60,86,89,99,161,188,215,221,196,78,90,132,206,214,226,231,117,211,212,217,7,76,11,21,81,209,22,85,168,205,218,8,63,195,225,232,184,207,17,23,83,109,227,166,182,200,230,16,229,91,121,187,15,13,118,24,189,190,111,191,1,5,2,4,6,14,116,228,234,202,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

While standard convolutions require \\( C^2k^2 \\) multiplications and additions, depthwise separable convolutions reduce this to \\( Ck^2 \\), where \\( C \\) is the number of input and output channels, and \\( k \\) is the kernel size. This reduction is achieved by separating the convolution into two steps: a depthwise convolution, which operates on each channel independently, and a pointwise convolution, which combines the outputs of the depthwise convolution across channels.\n\nThe design trade-offs in choosing between standard and depthwise separable convolutions involve a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Standard convolutions offer higher expressive power and can capture more complex features, which might be crucial for tasks requiring high accuracy. However, they are computationally expensive, especially for large kernels and high-dimensional inputs.

The camera captures visual features in the environment, which are used to track the robot's position and orientation relative to the camera's viewpoint. This information is essential for understanding the robot's movement and for establishing a reference frame for the navigation system. The IMU, on the other hand, provides measurements of the robot's acceleration and angular velocity, which are critical for determining the robot's velocity and position over time.\n\nThe fusion of information from these sensors is achieved through a multi-state constraint equivariant filter (MSCEqF), which integrates the visual and inertial data to produce a more accurate and robust estimate of the robot's motion. This fusion process helps to mitigate the limitations of each sensor, such as the camera's sensitivity to lighting and the IMU's drift over time, by leveraging the complementary strengths of both.\n\nPotential challenges arise from poor initial conditions or calibration errors. Poor initial conditions can lead to inaccurate initial estimates, which can propagate errors throughout the navigation process. Calibration errors, such as misalignment between the camera and IMU, can introduce systematic biases that affect the accuracy of the motion estimates. These issues can be exacerbated by environmental factors, such as changes in lighting or camera perspective, which can alter the visual features and make them less reliable for tracking.

The most challenging sequences (MH_04_difficult, MH_05_difficult) show a significant improvement for MSCEqF, with ATE values of 0.03 and 0.02 radians, respectively, compared to 0.04 and 0.02 for OV MSCKF.\n\nThis trend suggests that MSCEqF is more robust and accurate in handling complex and noisy data, likely due to its equivariant formulation and ability to handle non-linearities effectively.  The improved performance in difficult sequences indicates its suitability for real-world applications where sensor noise and environmental factors are prevalent.\n","source":"data/test/2407.14297.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[150,148,145,146,149,15,14,143,152,9,147,160,72,112,24,151,158,111,133,172,107,153,114,11,154,75,74,77,141,22,110,113,125,131,157,127,128,137,6,108,126,119,132,73,94,95,130,155,78,142,156,16,117,68,105,180,52,93,116,76,82,96,139,13,55,58,104,106,100,136,86,161,173,134,176,71,138,10,49,97,98,129,8,41,59,62,79,17,37,53,54,89,103,169,170,1,36,57,91,101,102,124,177,20,32,43,115,165,179,44,51,60,83,99,121,122,19,118,171,135,166,178,5,123,26,38,39,40,65,175,25,70,90,140,174,63,67,144,23,61,66,84,87,7,69,163,28,64,120,33,34,45,109,50,18,35,85,164,48,92,46,162,159,21,42,80,31,81,12,29,88,4,168,47,27,167,56,30,3,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1}]}

{"question":"What are the key differences between the classical EKF error and the equivariant error in the context of systems posed on manifolds, and how does the equivariant error provide an advantage in the design of the equivariant filter algorithm?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[51],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key differences between the classical EKF error and the equivariant error in the context of systems posed on manifolds lie in their definitions and the way they are constructed. The classical EKF error, denoted as \\( e = \\xi - \\hat{\\xi} \\), is defined as the difference between the actual state \\(\\xi\\) and the estimated state \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\). This error is constructed using local coordinates centered around the time-varying state estimate \\(\\hat{\\xi}(t)\\), which means it changes along with the trajectory and requires different local coordinates at each point along the trajectory.\n\nIn contrast, the equivariant error is globally defined and is given by \\( e = \\phi( \\hat{X}^{-1}, \\xi) \\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the transitive action of the Lie group \\(G\\) on the homogeneous space \\(M\\). This error is defined in a neighborhood of a fixed point \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\) and is invariant under the action of the Lie group \\(G\\). The equivariant error is a measure between an element of the symmetry group \\(\\hat{X} \\in G\\) and an element of the state space \\(\\xi \\in M\\), defined in a neighborhood of a fixed point \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\).\n\nThe advantage of the equivariant error in the design of the equivariant filter algorithm lies in its linearization about a single set of coordinates. This global error definition allows for a more stable and accurate propagation of the error covariance, as it avoids the need for local coordinates that change along the trajectory. This linearization is crucial for the stability and accuracy of the filter, making the equivariant filter algorithm more robust and reliable compared to the classical EKF.","source":"data/test/2407.14297.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[51,58,50,49,59,67,123,94,179,130,52,80,9,93,46,159,17,107,86,8,20,162,11,44,172,23,111,24,48,161,57,117,119,136,157,54,135,6,22,66,137,141,156,13,68,79,126,177,60,16,53,152,155,47,115,150,164,82,118,158,98,132,62,163,173,89,112,114,133,142,109,154,5,85,87,128,144,149,71,176,21,91,105,127,139,140,96,160,83,131,146,153,10,18,108,1,88,102,122,143,65,92,110,129,138,147,55,56,63,113,148,151,14,101,12,97,125,134,178,45,84,145,90,106,95,99,103,78,170,100,120,121,81,104,124,116,174,33,74,77,180,15,32,19,72,73,166,75,169,171,29,76,28,69,175,31,27,70,168,37,39,35,41,38,42,36,4,7,25,64,167,40,61,43,26,30,34,165,2,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The figure shows a sequence of robot movements where the robot is initially positioned above a central pot, then moves to the left and right pots to drop objects. This sequence is achieved without additional demonstrations by applying diffeomorphic transforms to the robot's motion.\n\nThe key capability demonstrated is the ability to bias the robot's motion towards specific positions without requiring new demonstrations. This is achieved by setting the positions above the neighboring pots as biased coordinates. The diffeomorphic transforms then warp the robot's motion to align with these biased positions, effectively shifting the motion to drop the object in the desired pots.\n\nThis capability has significant implications for real-world robotic applications.

As shown in Figure 6.5, OTNet generates a range of likely motion trajectories (red) that reflect the variability and uncertainty in real-world motion patterns. The ground truth trajectories (blue) are hidden during training, but OTNet effectively models the underlying distribution of possible movements.\n\nIn contrast, the nearest neighbour model, as depicted in Figure 6.6, transfers trajectories from the most similar training map.

OTNet can adapt to the environmental geometry and generate multi-modal distributions of trajectories, as seen in Figure 6.7.

Additionally, private sector involvement can enhance the quality and efficiency of e-government services, as they often have advanced technological capabilities and operational experience.\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. One significant concern is the risk of corruption, as highlighted by the participants. The private sector's involvement might introduce new sources of corruption, potentially undermining the integrity and trustworthiness of e-government services. Furthermore, the private sector's focus on profit might lead to prioritizing commercial interests over public service needs, potentially compromising the quality and accessibility of e-government services.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability. Additionally, fostering a collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship between the public and private sectors can help align their interests and ensure that e-government services are developed and implemented in the best interest of the public.","source":"data/test/2406.15375.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[285,261,314,237,191,233,173,211,236,264,18,195,280,61,336,198,219,226,268,277,294,2,94,35,69,117,178,203,217,220,223,232,235,265,273,281,284,41,126,166,32,140,109,187,221,40,225,279,275,286,106,201,202,73,190,230,152,182,229,29,36,129,167,193,227,295,14,22,28,179,263,282,180,189,200,269,8,128,177,208,231,68,95,176,212,224,96,172,192,119,197,199,234,287,58,353,66,214,222,312,27,316,328,20,186,260,266,334,348,23,31,228,297,315,339,288,323,338,67,318,10,115,154,283,306,351,118,169,272,335,12,13,112,114,194,292,308,38,249,256,341,347,62,72,164,340,320,325,331,1,24,330,15,207,298,33,168,253,344,350,39,104,185,44,107,181,248,276,6,56,34,63,64,75,84,196,307,43,65,301,317,175,245,85,311,26,103,213,252,302,21,60,127,183,209,240,293,174,218,46,153,158,170,309,326,345,47,239,241,332,7,16,147,342,45,102,110,143,86,278,171,250,313,49,57,111,296,300,310,149,243,322,333,108,254,141,251,355,76,98,291,321,238,59,188,259,290,327,271,303,101,247,304,255,19,113,324,25,78,258,319,329,70,246,9,155,162,216,55,244,257,346,74,77,89,51,130,133,151,79,100,148,42,99,242,349,91,337,71,343,90,138,299,37,88,210,215,48,161,53,54,92,93,97,146,30,289,160,137,142,80,4,50,132,156,204,52,81,144,163,184,121,157,159,122,11,17,150,87,267,123,135,131,105,120,274,270,125,205,82,139,165,83,206,116,262,136,354,352,134,145,124,3,305,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

As d increases from 0 to 2, MRE decreases, reaching a minimum around d=2. However, further increasing d to 4 results in a sharp increase in MRE. This suggests that a moderate depth of 2 divisions is optimal for SQLite, providing the best balance between handling sample sparsity and ensuring sufficient data for local model training.\n\nFor Lrzip (Figure 5.4b), the relationship is more complex. While there is a general trend of decreasing MRE as d increases from 0 to 2, the relationship is not as clear-cut as for SQLite. The optimal d value appears to be around 2, but the MRE curve is flatter, indicating less sensitivity to changes in d. The sharp increase in MRE at d=4 is less pronounced compared to SQLite.\n\nThe key difference between the two systems is that SQLite shows a more pronounced U-shaped relationship with a clear minimum at d=2, while Lrzip has a flatter curve with less sensitivity to changes in d.

This sparsity can be characterized in various ways across different studies:\n\n1. **Configuration Options**: Studies like (Siegmund et al. 2015) and (Jamshidi & Casale 2016) highlight that only a third or a few options contribute significantly to system performance. This indicates that most configuration options have minimal impact.\n\n2. **Factors**: (Jamshidi & Casale 2016) specifically mentions that low-order interactions among a few dominating factors explain most changes in the response function. This suggests that a small number of factors interact significantly, while others have negligible effects.\n\n3. **Configuration Primitives and Inputs**: (Chen & Bahsoon 2017a) emphasizes that too many inputs can introduce noise and redundancy, reducing model accuracy. Conversely, too few inputs may lack relevant information, impacting model performance. This implies that a balance is needed between input quantity and quality.\n\n4. **Performance Features**: (Ha & Zhang 2019a) observes that software performance functions are sparse, with only a small number of configuration variables and their interactions significantly impacting system performance.\n\n5. **Configuration Coefficients**: (Ha & Zhang 2019b) notes that Fourier coefficients for software performance functions are sparse, meaning most coefficients are zero, indicating that only a few configurations have significant impact.\n\nThese examples illustrate that sparsity in configuration data can lead to more efficient and effective machine learning models by focusing on the most influential factors, reducing noise, and improving model accuracy and applicability.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[127,126,129,7,128,132,131,169,210,57,80,125,14,86,22,43,123,130,122,67,121,212,211,27,89,170,23,58,79,223,93,21,49,124,165,225,100,133,146,207,213,9,76,156,2,3,48,92,40,164,251,258,62,155,168,221,35,145,163,217,24,74,228,20,59,95,167,134,222,240,166,202,6,138,151,242,250,136,159,19,64,171,209,139,140,144,238,173,200,45,101,150,203,253,56,105,135,160,176,179,208,243,54,83,120,142,152,174,244,78,88,161,224,61,65,103,153,41,94,147,184,237,30,50,85,87,117,137,183,205,236,77,81,91,245,18,55,143,157,175,241,26,63,119,229,234,246,247,42,51,71,84,90,172,180,204,226,141,191,254,37,158,216,249,256,257,25,29,82,102,239,190,206,227,44,73,197,214,154,235,72,75,96,12,66,70,118,189,230,255,53,104,116,162,177,11,32,99,231,259,39,60,149,260,69,218,220,248,5,8,47,110,148,195,219,97,232,28,114,178,252,52,198,16,192,261,98,181,182,31,13,185,194,201,46,112,233,68,199,215,196,109,15,33,111,108,193,269,115,106,263,187,107,271,272,274,188,1,10,36,265,270,186,264,268,273,17,34,113,262,266,267,38,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

(2021) compare white-box analysis with machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems. The key differences and potential advantages of white-box analysis are:\n\n1. **Model Transparency**: White-box analysis provides a clear understanding of how the model works, as it relies on explicit mathematical models and equations. This transparency allows for easier interpretation and debugging of the performance predictions.\n\n2. **Interpretability**: White-box models are more interpretable, meaning that the underlying relationships and factors influencing performance can be easily understood and explained. This is particularly useful for debugging and improving the system.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: White-box models can be more efficient in terms of computational resources, as they often require less data and can be optimized for specific performance metrics.\n\n4. **Robustness**: White-box models can be more robust to changes in the system, as they are based on established mathematical principles and can be adapted to new scenarios more easily.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: White-box models can be more flexible in terms of incorporating domain-specific knowledge and constraints, which can be crucial for complex configurable systems.\n\nPotential advantages of white-box analysis include:\n\n- **Reduced Overfitting**: White-box models are less prone to overfitting, as they are based on established mathematical principles rather than fitting to the data.\n- **Better Generalization**: White-box models can generalize better to unseen data, as they are not heavily dependent on the specific data used for training.\n- **Improved Decision Making**: The transparency and interpretability of white-box models can lead to better-informed decisions in system design and optimization.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[256,211,242,173,212,122,172,23,177,176,180,103,191,86,102,214,96,117,95,258,130,193,251,239,178,209,243,99,19,58,74,101,128,250,132,22,59,231,240,129,65,210,234,40,51,100,213,87,56,85,104,229,246,253,60,61,260,237,144,232,235,245,255,31,151,254,257,54,119,179,236,18,20,45,79,90,157,247,52,55,69,125,148,230,244,53,57,75,116,261,76,94,155,249,63,64,105,123,134,80,67,83,106,127,146,238,2,26,32,72,78,81,88,140,203,223,112,241,49,126,169,204,259,12,68,115,136,252,43,62,66,77,215,248,8,70,84,111,174,200,21,48,156,170,71,124,147,9,29,33,150,166,3,7,168,195,25,98,207,233,14,37,143,153,121,189,192,197,5,208,222,224,82,113,152,199,225,227,92,110,137,139,161,220,226,30,44,50,97,108,202,47,131,145,186,194,114,142,163,167,175,228,107,109,120,149,184,188,41,185,11,15,133,138,162,165,190,263,91,24,181,196,274,13,118,154,158,160,217,73,135,164,264,27,39,42,89,201,159,46,187,28,183,216,218,221,6,171,93,182,35,198,141,206,267,273,205,1,219,266,271,4,262,38,265,36,272,16,269,268,10,34,270,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

While WHISPER's initial goal was to boost interactions, it often disrupted them, causing frustration and negative reactions.  This demonstrates that technology, even with good intentions, can have unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe complexity arises from the subjective nature of social interaction quality.  It's not merely a matter of quantifiable metrics like conversation volume or gaze direction.  Participants described silent moments as valuable, suggesting that the quality of interaction is more about the emotional experience than mere activity.  This subjectivity makes it challenging to develop objective measurement tools.\n\nThe thesis suggests that future research should focus on understanding how subjective elements of social interaction can be observed, measured, and interpreted.  This requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the multifaceted nature of social interactions and the potential for technology to both enhance and disrupt them.  The design implications emphasize the importance of considering the ethical implications of technology interventions, particularly in terms of autonomy and privacy, and the need for comprehensive user testing and forward-thinking design.\n","source":"data/test/2405.13465.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[133,4,131,132,91,135,136,137,81,16,134,21,89,22,17,92,126,149,44,54,60,79,87,53,106,20,104,61,111,83,76,108,36,7,45,42,82,107,41,19,52,90,34,43,124,88,125,29,59,112,47,110,138,37,39,49,14,38,93,120,50,140,95,146,18,64,121,141,148,84,58,27,32,9,46,69,129,130,15,62,66,127,68,103,25,109,35,67,31,11,1,8,26,48,94,100,28,5,150,65,85,117,147,57,55,70,30,116,123,56,128,33,51,122,119,143,2,23,144,155,13,105,71,102,139,157,86,145,63,142,6,96,12,73,156,80,118,40,78,98,101,153,115,152,75,72,74,77,99,24,97,151,3,154,10,114,113],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This could trigger an Event of Default, leading to the acceleration of the debt, the imposition of additional penalties, and potential legal actions by the creditors.\n\nRegarding Event of Default Notices, the company is obligated to deliver a written notice via electronic mail and overnight courier within two Business Days of the occurrence of an Event of Default. This notice is in addition to, and cannot be substituted by, the Trustee's delivery of the same notice. The timely delivery of this notice is crucial as it provides the Holder with the opportunity to redeem the Note, regardless of whether the Event of Default has been cured.

{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat potential conflict exists between Section 10.16 (Governing Law) and Section 10.18 (Force Majeure), and how might this conflict be resolved in a legal dispute?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[234],"raw_output":"","pred":"The potential conflict between Section 10.16 (Governing Law) and Section 10.18 (Force Majeure) arises because Section 10.16 states that the Indenture and Securities will be governed by New York law, while Section 10.18 specifically mentions that the Trustee is not responsible for any failure or delay in performance caused by \"acts of God\" or other force majeure events.\n\nThis conflict could potentially create ambiguity about the Trustee's liability in situations involving force majeure events. If a dispute arises, the court may need to interpret which provision takes precedence.\n\nTo resolve this conflict in a legal dispute, the court would likely consider the intent of the parties and the overall purpose of the Indenture. The court may look at the context of the contract and the parties' expectations regarding force majeure events. It could also consider whether the force majeure clause is intended to absolve the Trustee of all liability, or if it only excuses performance in certain circumstances.\n\nUltimately, the court would need to balance the parties' rights and obligations under New York law while also considering the specific language of the force majeure clause. This could lead to a nuanced interpretation that attempts to reconcile the two provisions.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FSR_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[234,233,336,398,393,197,198,242,291,320,325,352,335,246,292,337,469,169,232,324,160,170,231,282,349,471,463,247,470,323,431,433,399,490,122,245,394,240,430,434,165,229,274,287,318,455,494,308,473,143,186,265,368,166,168,200,243,290,263,366,441,472,54,123,241,432,141,152,158,167,280,351,364,453,46,228,289,468,144,266,319,426,216,219,359,401,157,279,321,370,507,508,140,156,176,211,221,298,302,377,422,159,195,260,281,301,416,424,428,205,238,254,132,151,215,225,357,457,465,179,400,442,171,196,288,446,201,202,230,270,293,408,462,135,137,145,187,226,257,262,267,273,309,402,423,429,456,41,42,212,217,258,286,334,383,451,17,56,155,259,277,331,379,380,396,425,440,452,460,136,148,213,220,285,361,371,417,444,450,44,180,218,278,316,467,32,134,138,177,299,350,353,445,120,133,147,150,163,207,239,248,283,382,427,454,121,153,154,164,255,275,304,332,346,347,395,443,502,48,172,204,269,294,356,372,391,506,142,149,161,209,222,271,317,345,376,378,403,449,466,2,203,224,256,264,305,354,362,363,411,448,458,461,493,116,183,208,223,367,459,491,3,119,129,130,194,272,344,360,365,210,276,373,375,384,464,505,1,43,45,47,139,261,333,374,388,495,22,36,69,125,182,206,227,296,348,118,124,146,174,268,496,51,62,162,284,415,447,127,199,214,322,386,492,504,509,173,295,381,474,6,71,96,109,113,181,20,112,244,369,4,23,53,97,111,126,178,300,385,389,28,74,83,104,185,303,358,390,50,18,40,103,193,307,421,19,27,52,100,30,66,175,297,387,392,37,39,57,510,24,34,60,128,253,355,410,33,35,59,110,114,306,5,58,101,397,439,8,14,26,38,49,108,184,192,236,252,314,329,343,407,414,420,438,489,499,511,55,86,115,117,21,29,31,82,98,131,25,87,409,488,13,80,89,91,93,99,102,479,191,313,11,437,500,67,88,107,487,90,501,75,94,76,61,72,73,95,189,341,328,10,63,77,85,311,12,70,78,64,65,486,92,483,188,251,476,481,338,342,406,436,475,105,106,310,330,79,404,484,16,68,190,312,435,81,235,405,84,7,9,15,478,249,413,497,418,485,237,326,480,412,419,477,315,482,498,327,250,340,339,503],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This type of vehicle is likely a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). \n\nA potential application for this technology in the offshore energy industry is subsea inspection, maintenance, and repair (IMR). ROVs and AUVs are commonly used for tasks like inspecting pipelines, wells, and other subsea structures for damage or wear. They can also perform maintenance tasks like cleaning, welding, or installing equipment. \n\nThe deployment of this vehicle from a vessel suggests it is being used for a subsea operation. The ROV or AUV would likely be lowered into the water and maneuvered using remote control to perform the inspection or maintenance work. This allows for precise and efficient underwater work without the need for divers or other personnel in the water.\n\nThe use of ROVs and AUVs in offshore energy operations is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of subsea infrastructure. These vehicles can access hard-to-reach areas and perform inspections that would be difficult or dangerous for humans.

This reduction indicates that the company's management believes it is more likely than not that a portion of its deferred tax assets will be realized, thereby increasing the net deferred income tax assets.\n\nThe valuation allowance is a critical factor in determining the net deferred tax assets. A lower valuation allowance suggests that the company expects to realize more of its deferred tax assets, which can positively impact its future financial position. This increase in net deferred income tax assets could lead to higher reported earnings in future periods, as the company can recognize more of these deferred tax assets as income. Additionally, the reduction in the valuation allowance might indicate improved financial performance and stability, which could attract investors and improve the company's credit rating.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the valuation allowance is subject to change based on future events and economic conditions.

Additionally, the company used $17,055,000 for additions to real estate, which was higher than the $13,659,000 spent in 2022.

{"question":"What potential tax consequences could arise if the company's Operating Partnership were to be reclassified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" under the Internal Revenue Code, and how could such a reclassification impact the company's ability to qualify as a REIT and distribute income to its shareholders?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[22],"raw_output":"","pred":"If the company's Operating Partnership were reclassified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" under the Internal Revenue Code, several adverse tax consequences could arise. Firstly, the Operating Partnership would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership, which could significantly impact the company's ability to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). REITs are typically structured as partnerships to avoid corporate taxation on their income. A reclassification would likely result in the company losing its REIT status, leading to corporate-level taxation on its income.\n\nAdditionally, the reclassification could affect the company's ability to distribute income to its shareholders. REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders to maintain their REIT status. If the Operating Partnership were reclassified, the company might face higher corporate taxes, reducing the amount available for distributions. This could necessitate the company borrowing funds or selling assets to meet its tax obligations, potentially impacting its financial stability and ability to distribute income to shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, the reclassification could lead to changes in the character of the company's assets and income, which might further complicate its tax status and compliance requirements.

{"question":"How does Hillenbrand's approach to establishing reserves for different types of claims, such as those covered by insurance versus other claims, differ, and what factors contribute to this difference in methodology?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[118],"raw_output":"","pred":"Hillenbrand's approach to establishing reserves for different types of claims varies significantly based on the nature of the claims and the availability of information. For claims covered by insurance, such as auto, workers compensation, and general liability claims in the U.S., the company relies on outside insurance companies and third-party claims administrators to assist in establishing individual claim reserves. An independent outside actuary provides estimates of ultimate projected losses, including incurred but not reported claims, which are used to establish reserves. This approach leverages external expertise and standardized processes to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\nIn contrast, for other types of claims, Hillenbrand establishes reserves when payment is considered probable and bases these reserves on advice from internal and external counsel and historical settlement information. This method relies more heavily on subjective judgments and historical data, as the company must estimate the potential costs without the benefit of external actuarial analysis.\n\nThe difference in methodology stems from the varying levels of information and control. Insurance-covered claims have more predictable outcomes and standardized processes, while other claims require more tailored assessments based on specific circumstances and historical data. This approach ensures that the recorded amounts represent the best estimate of the costs the company will incur, while acknowledging the potential for actual costs to differ from these estimates.","source":"data/test/NYSE_HI_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[118,81,117,32,45,61,98,25,17,101,128,129,51,52,106,121,95,97,53,103,12,46,62,13,68,75,77,112,127,122,125,8,82,11,23,93,26,91,33,44,76,134,2,66,1,20,21,4,72,87,22,73,131,74,99,135,89,126,5,15,48,9,100,114,65,132,79,43,10,80,70,85,42,58,19,34,14,49,36,47,50,119,40,41,104,96,105,83,84,110,54,102,107,57,124,31,37,39,60,35,56,27,30,38,92,111,71,63,90,109,113,59,123,6,55,86,78,88,115,24,94,116,69,29,28,16,67,120,7,108,3,64,18,133,130],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This liability is secured by assets held in a rabbi trust, which are valued at $16.2 million as of the same date. However, these assets are not available for general corporate purposes except in the event of bankruptcy.\n\nIn the event of bankruptcy, the rabbi trust assets would be used to pay the deferred compensation liability. This means that the company's creditors would have priority over these assets, potentially leaving less for other claims. Additionally, the company would need to manage the rabbi trust assets carefully to ensure they are sufficient to cover the deferred compensation obligations.\n\nFurthermore, the company's financial statements would likely reflect the potential impairment of these assets due to the high likelihood of bankruptcy.

This distribution reflects their overall business strategy by emphasizing the importance of renovation and remodeling projects, which are a significant part of their market. The substantial 66% share from R&R indicates a strong focus on maintaining and updating existing homes, which is a stable and recurring revenue stream. This strategy aligns with their commitment to leveraging established brands and cross-branding opportunities to strengthen market positions and drive growth.\n\nThe 23% share from Single-Family New Construction suggests that Fortune Brands is also investing in new residential construction, which can be a more dynamic and potentially higher-growth area. This balance between R&R and new construction projects demonstrates their ability to adapt to market conditions and capitalize on different segments of the housing market.\n\nOverall, this distribution highlights Fortune Brands' strategic approach to balancing stability and growth, ensuring they are well-positioned to meet the diverse needs of homeowners and builders across various housing market scenarios.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FBHS_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[5,32,10,3,13,14,9,61,43,4,12,96,27,28,15,34,59,56,60,37,64,83,11,46,33,101,114,30,58,103,102,1,2,52,57,113,67,81,16,31,45,104,42,7,116,62,94,115,38,6,73,36,19,23,89,41,53,68,35,65,66,93,88,95,47,54,70,72,85,105,78,26,97,17,20,44,91,39,84,21,29,108,63,69,22,90,92,49,76,112,74,75,48,18,71,98,110,8,79,40,55,24,82,107,86,50,106,77,25,80,87,111,100,109,99,51],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The 2023 cohort, being the most recent, has reached the peak of this trend line, suggesting that this group of customers, on average, has contributed the most to the company's subscription revenue in 2023.","source":"data/test/NYSE_SEMR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[52,51,8,50,64,10,76,65,98,75,15,54,77,9,17,66,72,55,62,111,33,59,78,79,49,83,87,107,92,67,68,104,110,3,13,82,95,96,41,70,106,71,97,1,27,100,56,113,11,16,34,45,63,103,108,32,86,94,29,73,81,80,99,112,4,12,14,58,85,105,40,53,84,109,119,38,123,23,60,125,90,37,127,102,117,122,116,101,132,134,136,138,42,93,118,18,21,19,47,61,7,28,36,88,26,91,22,121,35,69,30,57,20,130,74,89,44,2,139,43,115,39,135,128,124,129,24,5,25,31,120,46,133,6,131,126,48,114,137],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The new arrangement is accounted for under quota share reinsurance accounting, which differs from deposit accounting in how premiums and claims are recorded and reported.\n\nThe potential financial reporting implications of this shift include:\n\n1. **Revenue Recognition**: Under quota share reinsurance, premiums ceded are recognized as revenue when earned, whereas under deposit accounting, premiums are recognized as revenue when received. This change could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized in the financial statements.\n\n2. **Expense Recognition**: Claims incurred under quota share reinsurance are recognized as expenses when incurred, whereas under deposit accounting, claims are recognized as expenses when paid. This could impact the timing and amount of expenses reported.\n\n3. **Balance Sheet Impact**: The shift could affect the balance sheet by altering the presentation and classification of reinsurance assets and liabilities.\n\n4. **Consistency and Comparability**: The change may affect the comparability of financial statements over time, as different accounting methods can lead to different financial results.\n\n5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The new accounting method may require adjustments to comply with regulatory requirements, potentially impacting the company's compliance costs.\n\nOverall, the shift aims to better align Oscar Health's reinsurance accounting practices with its risk management strategies and regulatory requirements.","source":"data/test/NYSE_OSCR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[71,63,33,118,94,65,84,64,89,13,16,8,49,81,85,25,130,18,72,74,62,109,87,121,32,120,122,3,86,7,9,98,119,126,127,91,19,88,4,5,76,78,69,92,110,12,95,6,50,75,40,73,96,1,17,48,15,30,53,125,41,24,77,128,10,66,54,28,68,67,20,38,100,31,47,56,82,105,114,113,29,107,131,60,70,99,37,58,102,106,11,42,111,115,14,123,124,97,21,35,39,55,34,44,61,117,43,79,45,116,104,27,93,132,2,101,26,52,46,83,57,108,36,59,103,23,112,22,51,129,90,80],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

These items are subtracted from Adjusted EBITDA to arrive at Net Income attributable to Matador Resources Company shareholders and non-controlling interest in subsidiaries.\n\nIn contrast, for reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, the company includes all of the above non-cash items, but also adds back the non-cash portion of interest expense and other non-cash and non-recurring expense (income). This results in a higher figure for Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities compared to Net Income.\n\nThe key difference is that the reconciliation to Net Income focuses on the income statement, while the reconciliation to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities focuses on the cash flow statement, incorporating both cash and non-cash elements.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MTDR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[126,212,213,120,123,127,163,211,124,171,178,179,90,214,149,166,172,34,118,72,82,176,130,180,145,170,28,140,161,188,202,16,156,167,196,204,60,114,146,174,192,198,2,116,128,147,164,190,200,18,108,160,112,162,20,22,206,66,131,4,19,148,26,32,136,182,36,109,142,144,184,40,177,201,113,138,30,155,96,165,46,24,119,194,17,84,168,210,74,158,64,68,110,197,70,117,38,111,185,85,125,209,122,217,11,15,205,5,27,50,115,135,181,8,78,102,121,129,87,183,14,137,199,37,41,54,98,62,88,35,133,58,104,186,3,29,169,173,191,195,134,157,189,25,65,175,21,31,71,86,132,154,193,203,7,48,52,56,76,187,218,23,44,57,208,33,94,152,42,80,39,69,99,77,100,55,67,207,12,13,1,47,59,91,93,97,9,73,139,63,92,81,150,43,151,159,53,6,105,106,143,79,107,75,83,101,51,216,49,89,153,45,95,103,10,141,61,215],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The net increase in unrecognized tax benefits over the three years reflects the company's ongoing tax positions and the impact of various tax-related events.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AYI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[76,74,75,59,45,58,56,61,60,48,53,40,64,24,25,51,9,52,70,43,71,41,22,21,54,49,73,17,50,65,63,101,23,67,145,15,29,47,79,42,46,201,26,34,37,6,8,35,55,69,12,118,188,19,44,148,30,57,107,16,66,72,100,164,190,205,27,129,4,28,117,163,175,200,10,128,217,32,62,206,77,174,13,38,189,216,20,84,218,33,36,80,7,94,102,116,130,191,193,104,112,132,220,232,1,31,81,119,144,162,178,192,235,241,125,153,176,240,242,14,99,131,139,185,98,159,168,177,204,215,227,68,92,97,141,150,165,173,213,214,219,239,244,85,122,127,146,179,223,224,238,5,93,135,142,211,231,233,18,39,91,181,83,126,133,136,143,172,182,113,138,248,171,207,111,86,158,169,184,11,187,221,230,78,82,134,147,156,180,209,212,222,247,103,106,110,120,170,199,226,96,124,140,166,194,210,236,157,183,237,123,196,228,2,137,90,186,109,198,3,114,115,121,161,167,208,256,108,160,243,245,251,154,155,249,253,202,254,197,203,252,95,259,229,246,250,257,89,225,258,255,87,105,149,234,260,151,195,261,88,152],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Subtract the amortization expense from the original cost\n\nThe original cost of the robot technology is $19,719,000. The amortization period is 8 years, so the annual amortization expense is $19,719,000 / 8 = $2,464,875.\n\nSince we're selling 40% immediately, we're left with 60% of the asset. The amortization expense for the remaining 60% would be $2,464,875 * 60% = $1,478,925.\n\nTherefore, the approximate book value of the remaining robot technology asset would be $19,719,000 - $1,478,925 = $18,240,075.\n\nThis is an approximation because the amortization expense is calculated on a straight-line basis, which may not perfectly align with the actual usage or value of the asset over time. However, it provides a reasonable estimate of the remaining book value after selling 40% of the asset.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,58,166,178,105,164,167,177,194,151,193,126,179,256,117,143,162,188,203,27,97,181,55,150,190,265,38,152,163,172,175,192,196,199,201,57,98,154,165,200,202,157,161,182,153,187,247,266,102,104,116,123,195,206,124,183,52,92,170,59,119,148,158,106,159,101,185,26,94,114,209,93,111,146,48,50,184,35,173,232,149,156,160,191,208,230,56,90,100,169,238,11,24,198,219,229,91,110,122,228,95,99,129,240,8,84,147,180,257,25,217,248,2,4,44,130,33,12,89,138,210,290,88,197,108,115,121,186,189,205,218,237,255,270,293,47,103,118,133,174,246,15,16,37,278,289,51,145,249,291,54,113,168,211,216,241,258,109,142,267,269,279,62,86,264,36,40,46,87,233,239,7,9,23,10,127,131,231,259,125,220,221,17,39,49,61,207,271,285,96,250,19,41,45,63,64,120,288,128,5,6,13,22,85,135,223,234,251,141,204,29,242,263,287,3,34,70,136,282,18,20,81,83,132,222,28,212,252,107,112,268,14,42,65,71,243,53,171,286,1,30,32,134,281,260,137,31,60,21,69,82,213,272,274,155,227,67,79,276,72,73,76,261,273,235,284,244,275,283,224,253,78,75,280,140,292,43,68,144,74,214,215,236,66,254,294,245,80,277,226,77,225,262,139],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This indicates a clear reduction in the reliance on related parties over these years.\n\nIn 2021, related party transactions accounted for a substantial portion of the company's total revenues, suggesting that the company was heavily dependent on these transactions. However, by 2023, the reliance on related parties had significantly diminished, with the percentage dropping to less than one-fifth of the total revenues. This trend could be indicative of several factors:\n\n1. **Diversification of Revenue Sources**: The company may have diversified its revenue streams, reducing its dependence on specific related parties.\n2. **Strategic Partnerships**: The company might have formed more strategic partnerships with unrelated entities, reducing the need for transactions with related parties.\n3. **Operational Efficiency**: The company could have improved its operational efficiency, leading to a decrease in the need for external support from related parties.\n4. **Market Expansion**: The company might have expanded its market reach, reducing the necessity for transactions with related parties to maintain market presence.\n\nOverall, the trend suggests a shift towards more independent and diversified revenue sources, indicating a maturation of the company's business model.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[149,190,92,148,12,160,176,206,13,163,174,185,205,154,155,157,167,97,184,191,207,152,153,159,11,146,161,165,181,200,204,178,180,195,196,203,142,171,175,193,156,169,170,182,194,162,183,177,186,189,151,168,202,58,98,187,192,201,172,199,286,6,24,91,145,188,198,166,14,287,57,158,7,101,147,150,173,179,19,164,4,8,121,197,93,116,1,113,27,35,281,282,265,283,285,133,284,288,246,258,293,117,126,115,118,140,255,135,51,249,25,56,90,15,61,263,28,62,264,95,37,22,232,119,17,59,136,138,16,99,107,20,280,266,94,104,10,102,130,276,38,44,89,141,143,103,257,105,253,261,63,131,23,49,96,110,60,33,216,220,64,85,86,34,209,111,5,26,36,109,272,45,3,21,228,88,230,208,40,47,73,83,210,18,129,132,30,48,231,237,239,31,39,42,128,134,247,9,55,240,248,46,114,217,291,65,70,100,124,269,106,120,229,256,278,72,221,238,32,43,267,41,241,271,218,29,50,81,137,52,80,211,259,279,84,123,213,233,243,290,2,108,270,219,227,67,71,78,125,234,260,74,252,273,69,82,268,289,144,274,66,122,250,68,79,223,87,225,75,77,214,245,292,275,53,127,212,254,244,277,76,112,224,235,54,242,139,226,215,222,251,236,294,262],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

Firstly, there are fees associated with the ADSs, including a $0.00015 per ADS annual fee and a $0.00015 per ADS quarterly fee. These fees can accumulate over time and reduce the investor's returns.\n\nAdditionally, there are currency conversion fees when converting Renminbi (RMB) to U.S. dollars. These fees can be substantial, especially if the investor needs to convert a large amount of RMB to U.S. dollars. The conversion rate is set by the People's Bank of China, and fluctuations in the exchange rate can further impact the investor's returns.\n\nThe value of the ADSs is denominated in U.S. dollars, but the underlying business operations are primarily in RMB. This creates currency risk, as changes in the exchange rate between RMB and U.S. dollars can significantly affect the investor's returns. For example, if the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar, the investor may receive fewer U.S. dollars for their RMB, reducing the value of their ADSs. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates against the RMB, the investor may receive more U.S. dollars for their RMB, increasing the value of their ADSs.\n\nOverall, these fees and currency risks can erode the investor's returns and affect the overall value of their investment in ADSs.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,55,52,126,51,119,127,175,9,10,4,177,33,123,174,169,15,124,122,159,162,203,28,200,27,47,38,8,50,54,125,56,57,118,163,44,204,170,11,17,142,164,168,176,167,189,196,35,121,130,165,197,145,161,115,120,179,207,173,158,37,148,202,157,178,160,166,172,149,150,151,186,22,191,16,93,147,188,199,12,180,194,152,192,39,190,206,154,182,156,181,187,205,21,36,88,184,18,25,32,193,195,201,40,153,171,42,198,41,1,63,34,46,146,155,183,31,104,29,106,20,24,114,62,143,26,49,105,19,67,81,185,45,91,30,92,267,102,103,248,58,76,258,2,131,23,86,97,5,87,111,66,109,80,82,84,98,117,53,70,85,101,257,61,59,64,133,256,65,100,129,268,220,230,241,3,128,221,247,95,289,290,68,75,78,99,132,269,94,210,250,282,209,271,281,43,60,110,211,240,249,278,288,71,108,219,265,279,83,141,229,291,116,266,69,89,90,112,264,138,259,285,232,212,218,270,74,293,238,231,77,96,107,251,7,134,135,216,233,79,213,260,73,239,286,223,292,136,208,237,246,255,13,113,252,284,14,217,222,243,6,72,228,234,273,283,272,242,287,137,263,262,277,144,245,275,280,214,139,294,236,224,253,215,235,140,227,261,226,254,276,244,274,225],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}]}

This transaction significantly impacted the company's financial performance. Additionally, the absence of the gain on the sale of the life, accident, and supplemental health benefits business in six countries sold on July 1, 2022 (the Chubb transaction), further contributed to the decline in net income. However, these negative factors were partially offset by foreign deferred tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nDespite the decrease in Shareholders' net income, Adjusted income from operations increased in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher earnings in the Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth Health Services segments. The higher earnings in these segments were largely offset by the absence of earnings reported in the first half of 2022 from the businesses divested in the Chubb transaction. Furthermore, the increase in Adjusted income from operations was also influenced by higher premiums, which reflected insured customer growth and higher premium rates in Cigna Healthcare due to anticipated underlying medical cost trends. These positive factors in the segments and the premium growth helped mitigate the negative impact of the HCSC transaction and the absence of the Chubb transaction gains, leading to an overall increase in Adjusted income from operations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CI_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[84,82,83,81,142,5,112,13,199,99,85,165,184,113,93,23,88,105,73,44,164,97,95,146,147,163,120,67,6,90,182,66,61,63,102,138,159,92,158,160,8,96,72,148,69,103,98,101,38,89,109,45,65,100,125,130,139,94,106,119,33,43,77,107,32,126,86,136,143,149,50,62,64,79,30,111,186,70,124,131,137,166,37,104,152,153,52,71,144,122,49,55,80,129,145,177,127,174,68,87,108,114,132,134,135,183,42,74,157,171,46,161,162,117,154,11,27,187,31,47,48,60,133,176,35,185,75,155,7,15,41,51,57,110,36,169,12,21,53,58,116,118,115,141,150,26,91,56,140,151,18,173,4,14,128,167,172,34,17,10,24,123,175,28,168,59,76,121,22,156,40,54,39,78,178,181,192,193,20,2,29,9,180,196,197,198,200,16,1,19,188,179,25,189,191,194,170,195,3,190],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This would give management a way to push through a vote that may not be in the best interests of the company's ordinary shareholders.\n\nThis scenario illustrates how the discretionary proxy could potentially align management's interests with their own, at the expense of the ordinary shareholders who own the underlying shares.

This could have reduced the number of new projects and hires, impacting revenue and profitability. Additionally, the company's strategic investments in technology and talent solutions might have strained its financial resources, affecting its ability to maintain high levels of profitability. The company's focus on repurchasing shares and distributing dividends could also have contributed to the lower per share amounts, as these activities reduce the number of shares outstanding and increase the amount of cash distributed to shareholders.","source":"data/test/NYSE_RHI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[4,5,7,6,61,41,46,44,35,33,37,49,62,39,42,55,34,38,40,56,57,36,43,25,8,59,16,31,23,45,52,21,24,48,54,3,32,73,53,60,18,64,10,30,11,17,9,28,66,27,65,20,96,29,50,47,70,1,63,68,13,22,75,58,15,84,87,86,78,67,69,79,19,85,82,95,97,77,74,12,88,98,51,76,80,90,92,14,83,81,72,93,89,94,71,99,91,100,2,26],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

The slight decrease in the percentage of current assets may reflect strategic investments or changes in the company's asset management practices, but does not necessarily signal a significant shift in liquidity.","source":"data/test/NYSE_RHI_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[45,64,40,7,43,13,37,44,48,55,46,47,53,11,29,57,62,15,74,4,54,5,6,41,42,52,61,68,16,35,95,3,65,69,1,49,94,96,73,56,34,66,10,39,63,91,93,31,92,8,28,30,36,60,100,33,67,70,90,83,17,84,9,58,85,2,72,27,32,50,86,14,59,87,88,89,38,20,77,23,12,21,25,51,98,75,78,99,76,79,81,97,80,71,82,18,24,19,22,26],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

In contrast, the Mexican peso appreciated by 14% against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar appreciated by 1.3%. \n\nFor a company with significant operations in Argentina, these trends have several implications. The devaluation of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar would likely increase the company's costs and liabilities, as many expenses are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. This could strain the company's financial position and reduce its profitability. Additionally, the company may face challenges in repatriating proceeds from exports, as the new foreign exchange regulations require full repatriation in cash bank savings denominated only in Argentine pesos and authorize payments abroad only with Central Bank approval.\n\nThe appreciation of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar would generally benefit the company by reducing its costs and liabilities in these currencies. However, the company must also consider the potential impact of increased costs and liabilities in Argentina, which could offset some of these benefits.

American Eagle Outfitters' stock price experienced a significant drop in 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on retail, followed by a recovery and steady growth. The S&P MidCap 400 Index, representing a broader market, likely benefited from a more diversified set of companies and economic recovery. The peer group's performance, while generally positive, may have been influenced by specific factors affecting individual companies within the group, such as supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer behavior, and strategic decisions.\n\nOverall, while American Eagle Outfitters' stock performed well, it faced more volatility compared to the broader market and its peer group, reflecting the company's specific challenges and opportunities during the period.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AEO_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[29,90,55,35,31,81,48,4,7,41,3,67,32,53,40,77,1,87,78,34,85,51,54,62,101,104,5,37,96,98,109,86,102,76,113,114,2,43,50,12,6,91,93,115,116,9,11,8,52,103,33,57,59,110,97,63,89,36,92,10,112,64,107,111,71,14,73,106,38,69,75,58,24,45,61,70,44,119,42,68,13,22,28,46,27,15,56,79,16,21,80,60,39,65,118,17,26,84,83,74,20,72,117,95,105,94,30,66,25,49,23,19,99,100,18,47,88,108,82],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The decrease in Property and equipment and disallowed business interest expense suggests a reduction in assets that are not currently deductible, potentially lowering future tax expenses. Conversely, the increase in employee compensation and benefits and capitalized research and development expenses implies an increase in deductible expenses, which could increase future tax liabilities.\n\nOverall, these changes suggest a net decrease in net deferred tax assets, which could lead to lower future tax liabilities.

{"question":"What are the potential financial impacts and considerations for a company when implementing a restructuring plan, particularly in terms of workforce reduction and consolidation of facilities, and how might these actions affect the company's financial statements and future operations?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[36],"raw_output":"","pred":"Implementing a restructuring plan, especially involving workforce reduction and facility consolidation, can have significant financial impacts and considerations for a company. Financially, these actions can lead to immediate costs such as severance packages, accelerated depreciation, and potential legal expenses. For instance, the restructuring plan at Agilent Technologies, Inc., resulted in approximately $46 million in restructuring and other related costs in fiscal year 2023. These costs include severance and other personnel expenses, as well as accelerated depreciation expenses related to right-of-use (ROU) and machinery and equipment assets.\n\nIn terms of financial statements, restructuring costs are typically recorded in the income statement as expenses, which can affect the company's reported earnings. The costs associated with workforce reduction and facility consolidation can also impact the company's balance sheet, particularly in the liabilities section, where they may be reflected as accrued liabilities.\n\nFuture operations can be affected by the restructuring in several ways. Reduced headcount can lead to increased productivity and efficiency, potentially improving operational costs and profitability. Consolidation of facilities can streamline operations, reduce overhead, and improve asset utilization. However, these changes may also introduce risks such as potential disruptions in operations, increased costs due to redundancy, and the need for new infrastructure or technology to support the reduced workforce.\n\nOverall, while restructuring can provide short-term financial relief and long-term operational efficiencies, it requires careful planning and execution to minimize negative impacts on the company's financial health and reputation.","source":"data/test/NYSE_A_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[36,61,99,100,26,37,20,27,79,30,21,25,18,111,19,67,13,14,22,3,17,24,40,32,68,31,47,52,156,23,102,28,71,90,70,87,33,109,35,106,66,125,49,42,45,107,147,177,64,127,51,65,105,139,34,48,93,104,138,197,78,145,165,185,72,146,76,82,189,202,155,196,46,77,38,54,86,176,184,15,43,55,114,164,44,91,150,163,166,186,50,63,108,170,7,198,144,151,203,88,168,187,39,41,62,94,158,1,59,81,103,137,149,181,204,10,98,101,129,140,162,75,124,142,143,191,83,92,97,167,183,116,123,60,96,182,190,113,148,16,57,80,95,128,131,133,152,171,180,12,122,157,174,175,172,192,205,115,117,132,199,58,173,195,2,161,74,126,206,110,112,118,134,6,11,154,56,136,169,5,178,84,130,135,153,193,29,73,120,179,194,85,141,69,121,160,4,159,200,53,188,8,9,89,119,201],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This divestiture resulted in a realized loss, which provided a substantial tax benefit. Additionally, the company benefited from tax benefits of $41 million related to foreign-derived intangible income and $30 million related to the release of tax reserves in the U.S. due to the settlement of the audit with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2018 and 2019. These tax benefits collectively reduced the overall tax provision for the year, leading to a lower effective tax rate. The tax holiday in Singapore also contributed to a $54 million reduction in income taxes, further impacting the company's tax provision.

It also provides a clear framework for determining ownership in cases where the employee's work might overlap with the employer's business or research.","source":"data/test/NYSE_ZYME_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[195,210,209,194,198,156,261,197,168,166,170,80,213,212,22,224,184,293,196,214,162,178,199,167,314,202,139,260,328,48,203,303,5,183,86,287,127,206,217,299,64,87,179,207,204,208,291,31,73,94,205,216,249,269,135,165,181,234,243,296,30,132,159,247,18,21,54,128,134,200,201,221,225,235,288,95,185,192,211,270,302,310,262,273,97,169,282,294,326,161,189,308,177,193,227,237,301,325,111,131,215,285,66,84,103,115,126,155,163,236,257,20,35,83,85,99,158,182,222,233,240,274,317,9,45,190,223,305,318,320,322,153,271,327,26,29,141,175,191,226,263,3,7,121,122,125,259,60,100,108,129,136,146,154,23,138,160,172,267,306,321,19,39,79,164,171,272,56,101,109,113,174,244,252,278,90,117,120,150,292,309,329,47,65,88,89,107,151,218,248,78,105,112,116,118,157,239,246,6,74,265,43,71,106,137,152,290,300,324,8,55,91,140,219,251,280,286,311,312,27,32,44,81,102,119,238,323,1,93,144,266,275,283,295,298,33,49,75,180,228,230,16,58,96,114,124,147,148,176,220,250,304,313,50,62,67,98,173,276,319,68,70,92,133,264,37,53,110,142,188,229,279,316,10,232,241,28,57,59,245,15,38,76,77,268,46,242,4,145,69,143,14,231,63,41,284,25,104,130,254,51,72,61,11,186,307,82,297,13,24,277,149,315,34,17,258,255,187,253,289,52,281,40,36,2,42,12,123,256],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The financial downturn may have also influenced HCI's ability to invest in growth opportunities or acquisitions, as it likely needed to conserve resources to weather the financial storm.\n\nOverall, the declining net income (loss) during 2022 likely forced HCI Group to adopt a more conservative and defensive financial strategy to stabilize its operations and recover from the financial challenges faced during that period.","source":"data/test/NYSE_HCI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[53,105,106,74,3,24,97,62,79,82,48,57,45,50,68,113,61,14,67,96,111,8,51,59,26,46,83,100,110,55,69,49,73,75,76,98,47,78,85,88,65,86,99,60,77,80,95,52,58,66,103,104,64,84,87,109,43,56,72,102,44,54,94,63,89,1,41,42,70,93,112,101,39,107,81,108,71,121,91,118,122,125,5,120,2,90,129,9,21,130,27,127,128,4,92,6,11,20,126,36,29,30,123,7,117,16,28,15,18,33,17,35,23,34,13,19,31,10,32,12,38,132,114,116,119,37,115,40,131,124,22,25],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This uncertainty stems from the inherently uncertain process of establishing loss and LAE reserves, which involves estimating the outcome of future events and accounting for both internal and external variables that are difficult to quantify.  The company addresses this uncertainty by carefully considering all available data and actuarial analyses when establishing reserves.  Changes in estimates or differences between estimates and amounts ultimately paid are reflected in the operating results of the period during which adjustments are made.  This means that the company's reported results, financial position, and liquidity can be affected by changes in key assumptions that determine net loss reserves.

Financially, the company's significant ownership stake allows it to influence the venture's operations and potentially benefit from its commercial activities. However, the limitations on the manager's authority and the requirement for unanimous approval for major decisions introduce strategic challenges. \n\nStrategically, the company must navigate the need for consensus among multiple investors, which could slow decision-making processes and potentially lead to conflicts of interest. This requires careful coordination and communication to ensure that all parties are aligned on key decisions, such as major investments or strategic shifts. The company must also be prepared to manage the financial risks associated with the venture, including potential losses from the Gateway Commercial Venture's operations.\n\nAdditionally, the company's role as manager necessitates a balance between exercising influence and respecting the autonomy of other investors.

This reduction in expenses, which includes categories such as research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and litigation settlement, was the most substantial factor contributing to the improvement. The decrease in operating expenses was more pronounced than the increase in revenue, resulting in a smaller loss from operations as a percentage of total revenue. The company's revenue increased from $396.1 million to $431.7 million, but the proportional impact on the loss from operations was less significant due to the larger reduction in expenses.

These factors collectively resulted in a $93 million increase in the valuation allowance, bringing the total to $538 million.\n\nComparatively, from 2021 to 2022, the valuation allowance increased by $93 million, with a $93 million charge to other comprehensive income and a $4 million charge to foreign currency translation. This increase was slightly higher than the $93 million increase in 2023, with a $85 million charge to other comprehensive income and a $4 million charge to foreign currency translation.\n\nIn both periods, the primary driver of the increase was the charge to other comprehensive income, indicating that changes in the company's financial position and foreign currency fluctuations significantly impacted the valuation allowance.

This could impact the company's financial statements, including its balance sheet and income statement, by increasing liabilities and reducing equity. Additionally, the company might need to raise capital to cover the shortfall, which could involve issuing new debt or equity, potentially diluting existing shareholders' interests.\n\nFurthermore, the company's credit rating could be negatively impacted, making it more expensive to borrow in the future.

In fiscal year 2023, the gross profit margin decreased to 48.7%, compared to 65.9% in fiscal year 2022. This decline was primarily due to increased costs of revenue, particularly in the cost of product, subscription, and support revenue, which rose by $5.2 million or 64% compared to fiscal year 2022. This increase was attributed to higher cloud subscription costs, ramping up of cloud hosting environments for a significant revenue customer in the second half of fiscal year 2023, and duplicative charges during the transition of certain customers from on-premises to cloud-based deployment formats. Additionally, the establishment of an inventory reserve during fiscal year 2023 contributed to the increase in costs of revenue.\n\nThese factors negatively impacted the overall financial performance by reducing the gross profit margin, which in turn affected the operating loss and net loss. The operating loss increased to $107.7 million in fiscal year 2023 from $229.8 million in fiscal year 2022, and the net loss increased to $111.0 million from $242.6 million.

This reduction, along with a decrease in headcount and allocated labor costs, contributed to a 39% decrease in R&D expenses.\n\n2. **Sales and Marketing:** Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $51.4 million, primarily due to non-cash stock compensation expenses of $51.8 million in fiscal year 2022, which were not repeated in fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the decrease in headcount and cost-saving actions further reduced these expenses by $3.7 million.\n\n3. **General and Administrative (G&A):** G&A expenses decreased by $55.1 million, primarily due to non-cash stock compensation expenses of $81.9 million in fiscal year 2022, which were not repeated in fiscal year 2023.

The company also noted that the Salt segment's gross profit increased due to higher sales volumes, while the Plant Nutrition segment's gross profit decreased due to lower sales volumes and higher per-unit product and logistics costs.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMP_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[70,72,76,75,104,71,12,84,13,19,78,94,117,123,7,74,115,125,80,130,137,23,68,73,97,129,6,9,21,81,83,96,100,135,67,93,119,144,69,101,111,114,102,106,121,122,124,134,139,105,126,128,136,34,133,10,120,8,20,49,55,61,79,82,86,87,56,98,109,54,77,118,92,157,163,62,65,85,127,1,64,99,44,48,88,113,131,138,140,149,3,142,145,159,18,36,47,90,91,110,116,143,158,26,29,45,50,95,148,152,57,63,89,108,141,4,28,30,132,112,155,25,37,46,52,53,15,38,43,107,151,160,11,16,27,66,103,40,41,42,58,147,150,153,5,17,22,146,31,60,59,14,32,39,33,35,24,51,154,161,165,166,164,156,2,162],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1 - Completely Incorrect","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This indicates that the cost associated with the services provided by the employees remained consistent over the period.\n\n2. **Interest Cost**: The interest cost increased from $0.3 million in 2022 to $0.5 million in 2023. This rise suggests that the interest rate used to discount future benefits increased, leading to a higher present value of the benefit obligation.\n\n3. **Benefits Paid**: The benefits paid decreased from $0.2 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023. This change indicates that the actual benefits paid out to employees decreased, possibly due to changes in the number of beneficiaries or the amount of benefits provided.\n\n4. **Actuarial Gain**: The actuarial gain decreased from $2.0 million in 2022 to $0.7 million in 2023. This reduction suggests that the gains recognized from the actuarial valuation of the plan decreased, which could be due to changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation or changes in the plan's assets.\n\n5. **Currency Fluctuation Adjustment**: The currency fluctuation adjustment decreased from $0.8 million in 2022 to $0.1 million in 2023. This change reflects the impact of currency movements on the benefit obligation, with a smaller adjustment in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nOverall, the increase in interest cost and the decrease in benefits paid and actuarial gain contributed to a slight decrease in the benefit obligation from $8.9 million in 2022 to $8.8 million in 2023.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMP_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,118,84,85,113,115,7,71,79,83,130,97,68,73,72,116,19,74,102,120,49,88,90,94,125,138,17,78,34,46,69,80,121,62,47,129,45,50,81,100,48,87,105,112,9,101,106,126,131,135,114,95,104,117,136,142,43,44,61,96,134,12,57,110,70,75,20,21,67,140,122,107,123,127,137,56,77,103,37,145,55,111,33,92,108,109,128,155,6,160,76,133,24,63,82,162,25,99,23,35,86,132,4,66,18,93,32,91,1,98,153,41,22,64,151,14,124,141,30,31,26,144,36,157,54,143,15,166,16,60,163,38,139,149,42,27,152,10,28,150,29,65,89,3,5,53,51,13,11,158,159,8,59,39,154,165,146,147,164,161,2,40,52,156,148,58],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Additionally, the confined space of the vehicle can exacerbate the fire's intensity, making it difficult to extinguish and potentially spreading to other parts of the vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, these substances can release toxic fumes, which can be harmful to the occupants, especially if the vehicle is sealed and the fumes cannot dissipate. The risk of explosion is also heightened in vehicles with hybrid or electric components, as the lithium-ion battery can be damaged by exposure to these substances, potentially leading to a fire or other hazardous situations.\n\nIn the context of vehicle safety, it is advised against bringing these items into the vehicle to prevent accidents, injuries, and environmental hazards. Proper storage and handling of flammable and hazardous materials are crucial to ensure the safety of all vehicle occupants and the integrity of the vehicle itself.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[112,242,48,50,399,388,239,46,389,532,70,104,132,429,62,384,59,241,6,459,466,113,379,537,98,111,530,97,142,528,103,382,518,525,534,383,385,314,395,517,47,206,453,51,208,226,302,365,373,397,400,60,125,482,510,52,107,213,240,372,527,71,205,209,396,398,110,117,187,425,426,522,57,58,74,122,350,427,531,63,66,102,266,275,315,390,100,116,124,222,263,303,366,376,465,467,512,55,56,363,423,495,529,551,61,126,207,370,377,418,424,483,2,3,64,69,127,253,255,257,358,422,496,49,90,94,101,144,374,380,387,401,513,14,45,88,149,238,244,336,355,362,494,514,569,75,154,265,353,485,489,252,258,357,392,457,521,4,72,87,135,225,229,267,356,381,391,463,515,523,141,264,288,299,472,93,186,246,340,516,44,78,89,105,121,227,106,145,330,333,361,464,486,488,499,53,67,73,115,129,293,348,349,364,404,487,520,533,31,109,204,393,417,434,449,492,524,137,221,250,294,419,444,497,519,553,92,99,150,162,212,268,304,430,511,95,254,285,291,368,555,568,54,159,193,214,245,310,327,335,339,342,346,352,410,439,68,139,191,219,220,277,296,329,493,22,79,83,188,192,243,256,371,378,460,552,554,210,216,506,1,24,82,84,120,217,269,375,490,108,321,403,428,446,25,119,130,284,311,503,65,91,128,270,421,461,491,133,134,152,211,251,324,451,454,468,80,85,96,123,138,202,276,286,462,42,77,114,118,249,279,297,344,452,541,557,38,76,189,218,228,231,237,278,456,7,10,17,39,131,185,190,196,203,273,334,367,436,478,546,567,23,35,172,261,287,292,347,432,433,540,558,11,300,301,322,323,359,409,437,447,479,544,545,550,570,157,175,184,338,415,438,448,504,143,155,164,223,233,282,308,313,319,337,507,21,36,168,174,180,215,247,260,343,442,443,455,508,13,33,224,274,280,316,317,325,369,542,556,16,171,262,271,290,305,306,320,341,470,535,8,32,148,234,281,543,30,41,86,140,167,232,272,328,458,475,481,484,502,9,81,156,173,201,230,248,298,309,326,345,469,473,34,37,195,236,259,283,331,354,406,445,5,19,26,146,153,163,170,307,312,318,351,386,435,440,12,43,182,199,295,332,360,471,477,505,165,178,183,235,412,450,536,538,151,526,40,402,539,136,198,394,549,169,181,289,416,480,564,15,29,197,498,405,166,28,179,476,420,563,18,548,176,408,160,20,27,194,501,147,413,562,177,411,431,500,200,547,509,158,441,560,559,414,474,566,161,407,565,561],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What precautions should be taken when using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, and why are these precautions necessary?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[530],"raw_output":"","pred":"When using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, several precautions should be taken to ensure safety and prevent damage to the vehicle's components. Firstly, it is crucial to keep the nozzle of the high-pressure cleaner away from the vehicle sufficiently. Bringing the nozzle too close or pointing it directly at the front grill, bumper, or other openings can cause damage to the vehicle's body and parts. This is because high-pressure water can penetrate these areas, leading to potential leaks, corrosion, or even structural damage.\n\nAdditionally, pointing the nozzle at door glasses and door frames can allow water to enter the cabin, which can cause electrical malfunctions or water damage to the interior. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a safe distance and avoid directing the high-pressure water at sensitive areas of the vehicle.\n\nThese precautions are necessary to protect the vehicle's integrity and functionality. Damage from high-pressure water can be costly to repair and may compromise the vehicle's performance. By following these guidelines, users can ensure a thorough and safe washing process without risking the vehicle's safety or longevity.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[530,336,529,340,532,144,350,388,246,483,132,265,527,142,330,429,533,267,303,465,528,111,365,381,418,531,239,122,126,459,534,376,425,208,314,390,371,206,379,382,384,387,521,204,537,48,121,225,252,353,378,91,253,380,479,494,103,258,263,403,424,453,212,254,255,302,423,452,466,515,226,275,374,377,426,518,525,389,63,221,256,266,349,357,373,520,58,116,385,404,457,472,496,523,102,110,115,510,71,250,486,93,113,296,482,513,514,524,52,101,104,229,14,145,150,240,392,416,488,72,90,125,241,245,273,274,454,470,497,519,57,59,66,112,209,238,391,401,464,44,187,372,396,55,56,159,174,213,361,398,493,45,61,62,70,244,268,354,397,428,522,558,46,47,50,51,60,75,88,98,117,207,217,285,375,417,568,65,69,87,205,222,291,299,554,97,149,196,243,276,352,355,410,458,489,105,129,242,315,348,366,400,427,541,3,22,74,124,133,134,137,192,358,491,49,257,284,288,356,409,422,492,495,511,551,569,33,54,227,269,362,446,455,512,37,139,321,436,463,485,516,94,143,310,319,324,399,434,499,53,277,308,395,118,154,163,188,293,393,432,451,109,114,437,438,462,2,305,333,447,448,461,481,89,218,228,550,108,190,191,316,327,339,342,369,433,526,556,106,152,304,4,83,162,247,261,344,419,430,517,553,67,107,210,219,249,364,175,211,260,367,484,120,135,230,335,368,442,443,444,23,25,92,202,487,11,38,78,439,220,223,449,540,542,84,127,153,64,141,146,320,322,323,347,363,456,338,77,177,232,272,544,557,1,10,95,248,292,351,415,471,473,477,555,79,99,193,287,406,552,68,236,264,311,7,96,279,507,73,307,412,476,155,170,214,270,309,318,138,370,5,200,233,294,467,36,136,140,158,186,383,411,478,6,30,216,278,508,271,329,504,100,237,440,128,130,160,259,282,312,405,408,27,31,345,505,313,326,468,475,545,17,35,148,185,337,343,469,325,346,546,32,119,172,203,251,262,297,317,543,298,21,157,231,328,359,460,147,180,498,502,224,235,281,474,24,161,194,234,300,306,450,490,215,445,151,164,166,535,13,41,81,131,8,123,331,171,280,301,76,86,286,181,435,334,414,9,82,156,184,283,332,413,16,183,189,386,407,561,12,42,506,29,567,80,169,195,431,18,34,201,295,536,549,182,197,26,40,85,167,178,290,570,15,28,503,20,564,566,198,199,39,165,341,173,480,421,509,548,289,360,538,500,19,176,402,168,420,563,394,441,501,565,43,560,559,179,562,547,539],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat are two scenarios where side airbags and side curtain airbags will not inflate, and why might these scenarios be particularly dangerous for occupants?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[110],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the target texts, there are two scenarios where side airbags and side curtain airbags will not inflate:\n\n1. Impact from the side to the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment (80J121)\n2. Impact from the side at an oblique angle (80J123)\n\nThese scenarios are particularly dangerous for occupants because:\n\n1. Impact from the side to the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment (80J121): This scenario likely refers to impacts where the side of the vehicle is struck, but not specifically the passenger compartment. In such cases, the airbags may not be designed to inflate, as they are primarily intended to protect occupants in side impacts to the passenger compartment. This could leave occupants vulnerable to severe injuries from the side impact.\n\n2. Impact from the side at an oblique angle (80J123): This scenario describes side impacts where the vehicle is hit at an angle rather than directly. In oblique impacts, the airbags may not be triggered or may not inflate properly, leaving occupants exposed to the full force of the impact. This can result in severe injuries to the side of the body, head, and neck.\n\nBoth scenarios highlight the limitations of airbag systems in protecting occupants in certain types of side impacts, emphasizing the importance of proper seat belt use and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle's structure during collisions.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[109,110,103,95,94,104,108,107,112,100,99,106,555,97,105,14,98,101,44,46,48,59,357,372,62,74,111,393,552,383,429,71,87,47,60,132,189,288,294,384,205,389,398,41,82,263,339,439,61,102,269,297,6,49,242,347,23,52,66,93,315,373,404,7,50,79,280,361,382,532,88,96,348,416,463,42,376,388,92,227,277,303,342,409,241,363,400,522,528,282,310,333,335,444,51,68,296,425,434,470,524,537,550,90,273,356,358,366,472,55,69,77,281,304,408,414,417,423,38,57,406,407,449,553,33,78,89,113,187,275,286,300,311,329,351,379,403,426,521,554,43,67,70,117,264,265,267,338,396,412,424,433,496,45,73,75,240,279,359,378,432,465,510,9,31,36,130,321,385,551,22,35,39,63,64,116,122,125,137,194,230,344,362,374,413,489,520,12,72,76,186,188,193,213,237,276,278,293,330,340,438,453,523,533,16,83,219,233,236,270,314,322,392,395,466,556,124,142,154,204,208,216,229,268,271,390,419,442,443,525,32,58,65,244,284,291,353,401,405,437,527,37,84,129,299,327,332,346,15,34,127,133,162,201,226,239,248,266,345,365,377,380,479,569,13,27,120,121,143,179,192,198,206,207,231,285,334,336,349,422,503,530,91,134,169,184,209,224,225,253,257,328,343,464,467,469,529,568,2,24,114,115,135,136,138,152,168,182,190,197,256,302,375,391,447,471,516,40,56,123,150,203,217,220,228,252,287,301,399,411,459,484,485,487,18,29,131,175,178,180,200,214,246,292,312,448,490,515,518,30,54,128,176,211,255,258,324,428,468,498,26,166,171,195,249,262,341,355,364,381,415,458,546,570,4,21,126,174,181,202,212,274,290,323,337,440,454,475,488,513,545,164,170,191,196,325,418,435,460,461,493,494,495,28,141,144,185,238,289,306,326,371,450,476,483,519,25,146,147,172,234,235,250,316,331,350,352,387,421,486,492,497,512,517,558,81,153,163,173,218,222,254,283,313,319,320,491,501,86,167,210,221,223,232,309,317,410,436,462,478,482,531,53,139,199,295,308,430,445,474,481,536,8,80,159,165,386,427,446,567,10,17,85,118,183,251,397,540,559,560,145,148,151,215,259,305,360,367,420,457,534,544,565,3,272,354,451,514,140,261,368,369,119,177,394,499,557,563,500,160,307,542,511,564,298,539,260,370,477,538,245,505,549,5,247,526,456,502,543,243,318,402,158,452,548,11,455,535,149,155,1,541,473,506,156,480,19,157,161,508,561,504,562,507,20,566,509,547,441,431],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What are the specified ratings of power supply cord kits and circuit protection for a range with a rating of 15 kW at 120/240 V and 10 kW at 120/208 V? Explain the reasoning behind your answer.","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[10],"raw_output":"","pred":"For a range with a rating of 15 kW at 120/240 V and 10 kW at 120/208 V, the specified ratings of power supply cord kits and circuit protection are 40 or 50 amperes.\n\nThe reasoning behind this specification is based on the power requirements of the range and the voltage it operates on. The range's power consumption is calculated based on its heating elements and other electrical components. At 120/240 V, the range requires 15 kW of power, and at 120/208 V, it requires 10 kW. To ensure safe and reliable operation, the power supply cord and circuit protection must be capable of handling this power without overheating or tripping the circuit breaker.\n\nThe specified ratings of 40 or 50 amperes provide a margin of safety. The 40 ampere rating is sufficient for the 10 kW requirement at 120/208 V, while the 50 ampere rating is adequate for both the 10 kW requirement at 120/208 V and the 15 kW requirement at 120/240 V. This ensures that the circuit protection can handle the maximum power demand of the range, preventing potential electrical hazards such as fires or electrical shocks. Additionally, using a higher ampere rating (50 amperes) for the 15 kW requirement at 120/240 V provides extra safety and flexibility in case of future upgrades or changes in the electrical system.","source":"data/test/ksdb900ess.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[11,10,38,39,16,17,44,7,45,12,14,28,18,8,19,48,47,36,37,15,25,1,40,4,27,46,23,42,35,31,43,58,20,9,41,5,13,21,6,51,49,57,3,24,55,56,2,54,26,34,50,53,33,29,32,22,59,30,52,60,61,62,63,64],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This limitation highlights the importance of being aware of the system's operational boundaries and the need for drivers to exercise caution in such situations to ensure safety.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[396,393,391,394,398,397,287,291,285,526,316,253,355,385,288,540,114,282,286,290,127,113,542,110,106,132,246,126,244,25,342,387,136,382,392,450,263,386,449,514,518,26,98,384,142,182,383,62,388,472,124,158,276,338,399,8,223,231,199,440,121,159,369,373,389,390,1,164,204,219,324,343,371,395,409,521,131,232,541,221,537,9,33,162,520,170,209,255,279,289,325,410,512,22,166,433,438,519,140,328,85,160,307,522,122,148,165,233,309,322,339,448,516,222,273,406,517,524,529,536,19,134,147,152,154,270,301,313,347,486,497,501,43,53,108,172,183,220,238,427,3,107,217,264,402,463,125,258,312,318,330,340,437,447,465,527,84,138,256,262,461,525,535,7,10,135,169,180,195,205,260,296,317,348,370,457,462,499,64,66,102,141,203,269,272,280,310,327,479,491,156,171,274,349,418,477,511,20,133,226,297,441,55,61,93,104,225,306,331,345,361,368,416,422,439,481,14,23,86,144,240,251,319,320,363,467,484,493,101,145,200,265,271,494,531,50,52,116,130,163,197,234,329,337,445,468,47,99,128,146,208,227,261,275,356,379,480,523,5,32,40,46,57,224,229,257,278,300,323,341,357,364,411,417,434,458,488,42,83,109,151,161,216,218,237,266,267,354,421,430,435,446,56,67,115,167,239,247,292,344,378,478,533,15,178,198,210,252,293,360,372,380,76,173,194,215,228,230,235,245,321,336,362,420,436,515,48,65,87,92,155,201,248,268,470,473,474,502,505,100,143,196,259,277,298,315,403,431,485,513,18,34,38,39,41,75,97,150,157,184,206,243,333,469,27,69,119,207,304,311,332,358,70,79,112,177,202,334,377,404,408,412,498,528,44,78,236,544,37,58,60,63,88,129,353,374,381,423,426,456,2,51,68,82,111,187,414,508,21,80,168,179,294,425,453,466,496,500,504,506,510,24,45,49,94,103,283,299,308,181,451,482,6,123,139,242,303,314,507,77,95,153,176,191,295,400,407,475,12,35,188,212,335,424,489,503,509,11,31,74,105,211,281,366,492,17,54,149,175,213,359,454,476,28,36,71,305,326,464,471,539,81,254,375,429,490,29,185,186,189,543,214,405,415,442,30,59,91,190,376,13,241,302,419,530,89,137,193,284,413,487,118,352,365,444,538,4,428,90,350,483,401,455,120,72,367,249,346,192,432,459,532,351,96,443,452,534,117,16,73,250,174,460,495],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"Identify the component labeled as (1) in the diagram and explain its function within the Rear AEB system.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[402],"raw_output":"","pred":"The component labeled as (1) in the diagram is the rear parking sensor system. This system is an integral part of the Rear Automatic Emergency Braking (Rear AEB) system. The rear parking sensor system is designed to detect obstacles behind the vehicle when the vehicle is in reverse. It uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance between the rear bumper and any obstacles, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, or stationary objects.\n\nThe rear parking sensor system works by emitting ultrasonic waves that bounce off objects and return to the sensor. The time it takes for the waves to return is measured, and this information is used to calculate the distance to the obstacle. This system helps the Rear AEB system to identify potential hazards and alert the driver if there is a risk of collision. When an obstacle is detected, the Rear AEB system will flash a warning indicator on the multi-information display and chime three times. It then automatically applies the brakes to help avoid a collision. The rear parking sensor system is crucial for the Rear AEB system to function correctly and provide effective assistance to the driver in reverse situations.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[403,404,402,292,406,109,285,405,8,540,15,253,290,526,102,110,114,283,113,319,320,307,309,247,348,303,223,243,6,121,152,302,321,143,218,245,291,38,132,153,324,392,274,325,503,86,94,180,344,428,474,82,216,228,296,13,118,127,230,239,310,328,343,355,383,421,423,441,66,157,238,329,331,401,463,482,542,30,96,297,373,7,10,69,148,217,384,394,427,11,312,318,399,436,93,111,194,19,155,162,351,479,9,14,47,58,84,106,112,142,206,277,357,468,12,147,154,418,510,535,29,100,134,145,207,229,295,354,382,95,470,481,500,146,236,359,512,27,105,183,220,255,323,334,379,398,475,478,136,166,233,350,358,389,97,128,140,179,208,259,280,332,20,50,103,67,79,137,210,237,445,78,104,176,235,279,306,397,21,25,99,209,241,390,426,37,49,62,150,205,278,286,308,375,43,224,370,380,491,51,264,330,141,221,287,322,339,342,391,366,76,122,123,133,144,163,184,197,199,311,396,36,87,124,164,381,388,467,486,23,34,40,75,169,219,284,425,439,22,41,61,171,298,409,473,55,126,131,160,232,347,465,225,313,346,362,477,537,541,17,46,139,269,335,442,447,457,484,511,18,56,85,193,275,349,364,413,498,523,52,57,81,83,92,165,200,201,372,376,410,430,509,519,70,88,190,215,258,314,317,337,48,77,135,341,60,156,159,211,248,387,98,107,212,240,368,393,26,65,125,172,231,356,440,24,39,91,158,187,504,516,203,265,434,455,129,182,195,301,336,361,524,63,161,177,227,300,385,407,483,28,64,73,252,289,369,493,538,45,71,151,480,33,80,178,222,271,429,459,35,202,345,363,438,44,53,54,130,244,246,371,374,536,5,167,170,191,352,360,450,446,488,31,213,333,340,499,501,505,544,59,115,138,234,251,270,288,327,471,525,74,226,272,198,204,254,276,400,414,451,466,530,68,116,168,415,419,420,462,533,256,326,437,119,175,316,338,422,173,267,315,365,367,411,461,507,539,249,378,449,520,42,72,192,262,293,408,117,454,464,472,490,185,395,458,515,2,412,424,444,476,101,453,529,4,32,149,469,497,518,527,266,417,485,487,502,181,299,386,435,531,496,532,242,263,294,189,416,489,3,90,214,273,120,260,431,456,522,281,495,508,268,433,514,543,108,188,282,432,494,305,377,448,492,528,186,196,261,517,257,443,513,521,89,353,506,304,250,16,452,1,174,460,534],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The Brake warning light would indicate a braking system problem, while the blinking Hill Descent Control indicator would indicate a malfunction with the Hill Descent Control system.\n","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[15,107,418,419,102,417,124,275,411,253,414,542,106,259,103,104,108,129,406,538,413,435,276,403,498,256,389,125,272,109,266,274,288,316,362,130,372,388,123,257,34,311,412,416,470,527,127,86,121,273,277,305,334,407,539,96,110,122,126,398,415,11,91,383,404,262,337,376,384,70,136,159,278,410,447,535,105,258,290,325,437,380,420,465,79,185,261,270,312,343,357,364,385,75,295,299,341,486,541,95,188,245,326,344,424,430,434,80,128,156,333,368,87,94,184,240,317,338,356,431,448,525,540,151,190,243,268,289,369,402,471,100,153,187,284,378,426,429,476,524,264,271,340,371,446,462,537,35,71,149,200,247,296,370,374,397,516,518,523,191,263,392,408,473,480,517,76,113,260,304,324,339,353,469,526,536,117,186,297,313,360,363,379,2,63,158,193,198,208,222,314,330,367,394,421,464,134,148,152,163,196,204,251,269,282,327,355,396,405,427,531,93,119,154,181,242,335,336,138,139,178,306,309,377,444,502,5,18,99,114,135,170,199,201,285,298,352,365,391,401,425,450,466,482,491,12,118,147,234,255,283,301,323,359,381,445,23,40,166,226,232,235,300,331,497,10,36,58,144,155,169,175,280,293,302,310,315,318,342,386,422,433,441,451,468,501,24,162,182,194,229,291,17,78,168,192,220,248,307,322,375,32,77,132,189,195,267,329,387,399,456,479,529,8,55,98,143,202,219,237,244,308,345,373,393,461,494,521,37,112,142,180,205,319,27,43,141,239,286,303,321,349,442,39,61,69,85,111,223,252,279,287,346,347,361,459,467,472,478,544,62,65,81,133,161,177,294,354,454,455,474,475,477,13,28,46,53,92,171,246,328,390,528,25,26,45,74,88,183,227,233,458,463,481,492,513,41,54,59,212,332,366,428,496,42,64,164,207,210,213,224,238,254,400,409,440,449,493,522,52,101,218,351,382,488,504,20,47,49,67,146,165,532,44,160,216,423,484,530,209,217,512,66,281,292,395,443,137,176,436,483,499,509,50,131,173,236,68,215,230,38,48,60,145,150,206,320,348,489,7,115,203,490,500,231,228,519,51,82,221,511,9,19,29,140,4,241,265,350,438,84,172,197,358,33,3,73,453,457,503,515,56,22,30,72,157,249,485,116,211,31,83,167,21,57,225,14,89,120,487,510,533,505,90,508,514,520,97,432,6,439,506,507,174,534,179,543,495,250,452,1,460,214,16],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This step is important for several reasons:\n\n1. It helps reduce the risk of battery explosion. The text warns that explosive hydrogen gas is always present near the battery, and covering it with a moist cloth can help absorb any gas that escapes, reducing the chance of an explosion.\n\n2. It provides a barrier between the battery and the jumper cables. The moist cloth acts as a buffer, preventing direct contact between the battery terminals and the jumper cables, which could cause sparks and potential fire hazards.\n\n3. It helps dissipate heat from the battery. Jump starting can generate significant heat, and the moist cloth can help cool the battery by absorbing some of this heat.\n\n4. It can help prevent battery fluid from splashing out. The cloth can catch any fluid that escapes from the battery terminals, reducing the risk of corrosive acid coming into contact with nearby surfaces or people.\n\nBy covering the battery with a moist cloth, the text aims to create a safer environment during the jump starting process, mitigating potential hazards associated with battery handling and electrical connections.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[445,444,472,461,541,446,448,267,471,538,433,498,266,268,251,437,467,155,262,408,536,159,430,537,256,525,220,269,480,255,270,454,540,204,458,410,413,431,447,456,188,232,420,462,263,275,276,474,149,261,271,407,412,469,224,526,23,194,264,278,316,434,442,28,32,63,64,156,259,260,440,486,152,163,326,426,455,465,475,164,274,468,502,524,535,2,18,26,40,59,79,125,153,170,182,217,168,181,222,288,304,405,464,499,27,42,77,80,176,195,233,254,322,337,369,386,402,441,466,24,138,139,178,200,324,362,414,417,459,473,523,124,177,185,189,190,203,306,395,484,516,123,154,166,302,330,342,364,376,411,425,451,490,539,39,103,201,207,406,517,36,50,205,248,300,343,372,403,513,531,47,121,130,184,253,381,453,491,493,497,4,25,34,52,106,129,143,151,161,191,196,206,272,318,338,346,378,435,436,438,470,527,55,71,127,169,187,235,298,379,385,398,429,528,15,17,37,46,54,100,104,110,374,415,416,443,494,20,30,53,61,76,108,135,144,202,236,237,240,290,294,345,424,518,542,88,91,96,102,158,165,175,193,209,223,226,234,371,400,428,38,49,58,60,78,160,186,199,242,273,283,336,347,349,357,367,388,478,35,44,68,118,128,137,142,192,210,243,247,277,280,315,360,368,382,383,384,389,396,477,501,45,56,75,94,122,141,145,162,218,221,257,305,311,320,328,333,359,373,401,423,463,504,522,62,85,105,245,258,303,340,390,399,457,41,43,86,208,219,265,295,317,323,341,353,397,427,432,450,489,51,57,65,148,215,282,312,476,48,107,171,172,216,231,284,285,296,307,310,325,335,348,11,70,87,109,126,147,183,198,308,321,363,370,375,377,394,404,418,419,439,544,10,31,33,112,230,249,293,301,334,355,483,82,99,212,299,327,492,496,529,29,74,93,113,134,146,180,319,356,366,387,391,393,481,505,6,9,22,66,133,173,227,252,279,292,314,344,352,354,358,365,422,69,117,119,211,281,329,479,482,488,19,67,132,361,380,421,3,289,331,351,503,8,92,136,225,409,449,81,95,246,286,287,297,97,114,519,72,515,530,14,115,213,244,509,532,239,332,500,116,157,241,392,512,520,521,197,291,309,485,140,179,229,313,339,21,89,111,350,508,98,101,131,228,83,511,7,12,13,84,460,120,167,238,5,90,487,506,507,543,214,495,73,150,510,534,533,514,1,174,452,250,16],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

However, it has several limitations and specific usage conditions. The ACC system does not function in all driving, traffic, weather, and road conditions, and it is not intended for city driving. It is crucial for the driver to remain attentive and in control at all times, as the ACC system is only an aid and not a collision warning or avoidance device. The driver must be responsible for observing posted speed limits, not setting the speed over them, and not relying on the system to prevent accidents or control the vehicle's speed in emergency situations.\n\nThe ACC system can only apply up to 40% of the vehicle's total braking power, which means it may not be effective in severe braking scenarios. It also does not react to stationary or slow-moving vehicles, and the driver must be prepared to manually control the vehicle's speed and distance. The system cancels and sounds a warning chime if the speed is below approximately 15 MPH (25 km/h) and a vehicle is not detected ahead.\n\nIn summary, while the ACC system enhances driving comfort and safety, it is essential for the driver to remain vigilant and in control, as the system is not a substitute for attentive driving.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[360,327,330,338,339,374,368,369,370,337,361,371,325,331,340,342,343,364,128,336,362,372,334,349,536,363,345,357,381,328,341,127,335,379,129,276,305,378,380,526,280,535,252,265,344,136,126,282,284,352,417,291,416,262,333,440,527,414,210,93,288,415,147,253,263,356,70,418,317,329,389,348,365,409,281,158,106,113,209,237,451,69,159,290,376,396,155,367,10,243,245,306,386,431,399,289,315,419,279,322,347,408,531,384,385,125,420,318,412,426,87,260,387,401,217,273,398,405,242,246,298,324,402,407,413,15,18,278,404,137,208,251,274,382,102,138,153,166,304,316,377,397,410,26,74,170,200,258,462,168,244,267,301,373,424,429,521,36,75,224,270,296,319,518,23,108,169,195,293,435,194,234,248,255,312,346,391,537,540,32,135,199,448,524,538,542,154,205,247,323,395,434,474,60,117,122,163,204,207,261,314,388,411,71,79,107,177,178,181,222,272,275,299,310,33,34,88,109,124,139,308,469,499,133,162,257,366,390,446,37,103,104,114,123,145,196,216,259,277,383,400,449,65,121,141,144,148,176,180,300,309,311,430,525,11,471,511,68,149,201,220,226,268,269,303,313,321,332,427,447,481,2,92,118,185,202,203,213,239,406,498,541,152,156,186,190,198,212,215,256,295,441,501,504,544,20,35,80,86,132,165,182,193,206,271,283,403,421,454,473,183,254,264,285,326,394,425,464,63,99,105,142,146,184,189,240,393,476,486,81,91,161,191,197,227,228,297,355,359,422,465,294,423,437,450,456,480,512,85,134,157,428,444,466,468,484,38,100,143,171,221,266,302,493,494,40,110,211,223,320,375,442,459,463,532,533,140,160,187,232,307,496,523,528,24,58,62,94,96,192,233,238,351,17,27,41,43,44,51,61,111,167,235,287,392,445,472,497,229,52,150,188,461,21,67,78,179,353,457,3,22,31,64,77,119,173,218,436,475,488,502,25,59,66,76,130,219,236,354,489,490,508,45,101,175,286,470,42,55,56,225,249,443,455,467,491,4,112,479,500,517,72,131,231,513,46,115,432,458,516,30,98,151,164,230,509,529,39,47,214,241,19,49,358,453,73,172,292,433,478,520,530,14,28,53,97,515,7,54,487,503,539,8,29,83,116,120,522,48,477,50,505,519,9,510,438,95,439,57,350,492,507,6,483,485,84,89,250,13,482,452,12,5,514,506,82,1,90,460,543,174,534,495,16],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What does the signal strength value of 17 likely indicate about the quality of the LTE connection shown in the image?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[27],"raw_output":"","pred":"The signal strength value of 17 shown in the image likely indicates a relatively strong LTE connection. \n\nThe image displays a window showing the status of a DWR-957M LTE modem. The signal strength bar shows a value of 17, which is positioned near the top of the scale. This suggests that the modem is receiving a good quality LTE signal.\n\nIn general, LTE signal strength values range from 0 to 20, with higher numbers indicating stronger signals. A value of 17 is well within the range of what would be considered a strong signal.\n\nThe presence of multiple bars in the signal strength indicator further supports this interpretation. The image shows three bars filled with color, which typically represent different levels of signal strength. The fact that all three bars are filled suggests that the modem is receiving a consistent and strong signal across multiple frequency bands.\n\nOverall, the signal strength value of 17 and the full bars in the indicator strongly indicate that the LTE connection is of high quality, with good reception and reliability.

Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Fan the Paper**: Before loading the paper, gently fan the stack of paper well. This helps to separate the sheets and prevent them from sticking together, which can lead to paper jams and misfeeds.\n\n2. **Check Paper Condition**: Always make sure the paper is not curled or wrinkled. Curled or wrinkled paper can cause feeding issues and may not feed properly through the printer.\n\n3. **Load Paper**: Gently load the paper into the paper tray with the printing surface face down. This ensures that the paper feeds correctly and prevents misfeeds.\n\n4. **Adjust Paper Guides**: After loading the paper, gently adjust the paper width guides (1) and the paper length guide (2) to fit the paper size. Make sure these guides touch the edges of the paper to ensure it is flat in the tray.\n\n5. **Close the Output Tray Cover**: Once the paper is loaded and the guides are adjusted, close the output paper tray cover.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the paper is properly prepared and loaded, reducing the risk of paper jams and misfeeds.","source":"data/test/mfcj1800dw.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,44,33,41,38,414,371,36,43,32,34,45,365,370,40,367,140,348,362,35,48,336,39,368,413,42,69,52,412,143,88,121,343,335,376,2,49,410,30,137,375,393,31,50,65,346,72,53,55,64,349,347,378,86,427,58,418,56,366,479,457,136,363,456,75,147,377,364,146,128,110,408,411,369,360,429,465,135,373,60,358,428,20,385,188,466,5,28,350,401,468,144,174,430,127,47,76,124,125,126,151,198,223,321,399,446,123,406,359,6,115,158,317,386,400,112,310,323,402,29,141,248,66,129,197,219,246,338,361,145,324,344,46,68,95,114,155,264,57,63,97,105,131,132,200,243,316,381,388,431,90,134,208,307,403,420,61,73,79,83,91,106,133,157,325,333,353,87,101,104,189,230,234,416,419,80,100,152,153,154,186,201,265,291,295,303,315,337,354,407,10,218,305,374,392,51,67,82,108,193,217,229,237,417,185,202,263,394,439,444,25,247,327,345,352,384,438,3,78,99,168,178,233,249,269,440,476,15,117,139,148,213,242,255,266,304,330,383,26,111,176,273,285,322,372,442,448,475,109,180,205,328,425,450,454,472,92,102,236,293,404,409,443,22,54,173,216,272,422,436,484,70,81,89,169,220,281,289,296,329,396,463,473,23,24,74,107,159,260,437,451,162,171,206,271,280,397,462,18,96,98,167,187,207,227,240,258,259,268,275,320,380,458,239,261,290,382,482,175,228,391,172,212,225,278,292,389,204,480,160,192,203,221,226,267,357,390,478,122,130,238,244,445,161,166,224,355,4,138,467,19,183,441,120,379,470,179,182,424,156,387,435,474,17,270,118,286,297,342,423,464,27,274,481,16,113,163,195,211,214,251,254,277,318,356,257,287,311,415,312,170,210,433,21,294,351,164,339,421,426,449,288,314,245,279,452,460,461,14,308,447,222,241,434,319,71,276,103,196,395,150,165,398,142,184,302,331,469,235,284,301,326,432,194,253,459,298,334,485,84,252,262,282,11,116,181,299,85,94,199,250,283,471,453,487,306,313,340,177,231,483,300,332,232,405,59,341,13,62,119,190,309,77,191,215,486,93,477,9,149,256,455,12,7,209,8,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What are the potential drawbacks of using custom phone features on the same line as a fax machine, and how can Brother's ECM feature mitigate these issues?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[380],"raw_output":"","pred":"Using custom phone features on the same line as a fax machine can lead to several potential drawbacks. These features, such as Call Waiting, Call Waiting/Caller ID, Caller ID, Voice Mail, and answering machines, can interfere with fax operations. For instance, if a custom feature's signal disrupts the fax transmission or reception, it can result in temporary interruptions or disruptions, leading to poor fax quality or failed transmissions. This can be particularly problematic for businesses that rely on reliable fax communication.\n\nBrother's ECM (Error Correction Mode) feature helps mitigate these issues by improving the reliability of fax transmission and reception. ECM works by detecting and correcting errors that may occur during the transmission process, ensuring that the fax data is received accurately. This feature is particularly useful in environments where there is potential for interference from custom phone features. By reducing the likelihood of transmission errors, ECM helps maintain the integrity of fax communications, even in the presence of these custom features. Therefore, while custom features can create challenges, ECM provides a solution to enhance the reliability and efficiency of fax operations.","source":"data/test/mfcj1800dw.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[381,379,380,384,211,210,221,388,218,169,166,382,180,215,224,197,258,196,329,99,345,4,186,3,213,330,217,5,101,349,390,392,439,188,339,377,467,165,174,233,248,385,468,168,374,375,457,163,167,191,195,216,243,247,155,170,244,328,376,193,198,225,297,411,178,181,378,391,393,20,94,347,92,150,219,245,343,346,463,482,18,162,171,172,179,246,314,344,400,177,212,214,372,373,423,458,461,470,472,2,47,184,185,192,222,253,322,353,428,438,456,462,80,183,223,351,445,479,6,17,95,175,176,327,340,355,363,386,394,134,137,234,287,315,421,465,82,83,97,232,280,466,59,63,208,226,227,267,451,481,15,105,141,242,250,318,406,408,429,460,78,151,187,194,220,239,265,272,331,415,450,10,16,125,157,209,251,252,270,301,364,409,412,444,459,13,104,118,135,158,173,189,202,249,399,434,25,145,156,205,236,260,275,278,319,348,350,365,405,427,435,68,149,182,241,263,395,417,418,420,464,48,75,89,115,117,129,136,164,199,235,238,266,281,284,285,309,324,325,354,401,410,1,32,46,111,201,231,240,279,317,326,342,352,356,368,402,416,431,446,452,76,103,112,128,160,190,255,261,264,271,277,305,321,332,383,413,419,432,437,483,12,43,44,49,85,109,113,123,132,237,299,307,316,407,426,433,447,453,473,29,36,40,50,52,61,62,70,131,147,159,203,268,311,313,370,398,403,436,30,81,88,102,140,143,146,282,358,369,371,389,469,54,58,90,106,228,310,334,367,26,33,114,120,161,200,291,14,37,56,139,204,207,276,283,289,320,387,440,478,19,34,154,259,449,475,477,485,38,66,73,77,86,107,153,206,295,323,333,414,425,442,8,87,152,303,306,396,60,65,286,142,293,296,341,359,362,28,71,257,269,288,448,487,22,57,91,302,360,361,366,64,79,93,486,9,11,74,121,397,404,443,454,476,45,84,298,312,338,35,51,148,337,424,455,480,55,67,69,119,130,304,335,430,98,122,357,254,274,471,42,53,96,108,138,41,24,144,21,100,273,308,72,336,422,116,292,294,39,256,474,23,27,230,484,31,127,229,300,441,126,110,124,133,290,262,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This pattern is the most commonly used and is easily distinguishable from the standard ring pattern. The Short-Short pattern consists of two short rings followed by two long rings, which creates a unique and easily recognizable sequence. This makes it easier for the user to identify incoming calls to their fax number, ensuring that they do not miss important fax messages. Additionally, the Short-Short pattern is likely to be less likely to conflict with other ring patterns, making it a reliable choice for a distinctive ring. Other patterns, such as Short-Long-Short or Short-Short-Long, may be less distinct and could potentially be confused with other ring patterns, especially if the user has multiple lines or if the telephone company assigns similar patterns to other users. Therefore, for a user seeking a clear and easily identifiable distinctive ring pattern, Ring Pattern #1 is the most appropriate choice.","source":"data/test/mfcj1800dw.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[211,213,212,458,210,21,218,166,214,416,165,209,350,4,113,219,382,346,82,457,164,193,8,226,380,102,131,249,411,168,345,420,64,80,115,138,349,121,197,224,425,436,479,6,126,95,117,363,465,377,70,125,143,297,76,114,124,188,277,374,97,287,379,344,422,478,10,145,264,268,466,470,127,128,198,324,385,91,137,167,169,196,481,56,81,295,378,472,348,459,17,37,52,376,73,99,100,109,139,146,305,375,78,347,355,364,123,216,225,136,162,258,265,291,392,112,132,147,187,234,269,337,365,390,414,2,5,50,51,294,296,393,430,473,36,43,83,101,135,191,195,243,310,381,384,7,69,129,194,432,462,292,372,406,419,208,271,321,339,435,461,40,54,88,90,450,480,28,32,44,65,72,75,110,153,220,289,343,383,403,423,456,460,464,468,120,141,176,286,301,327,333,3,48,67,111,140,290,335,404,34,86,144,151,163,248,412,16,20,33,47,87,152,217,255,272,318,18,261,266,312,38,49,66,68,79,155,204,229,299,311,368,369,370,388,400,401,482,106,158,186,284,319,402,428,429,486,19,89,122,189,325,356,367,487,185,228,288,373,394,15,74,92,118,154,156,386,391,13,25,171,172,173,192,215,247,313,405,440,445,22,108,242,358,431,483,9,46,98,133,201,230,244,254,285,303,316,421,442,454,463,23,31,35,42,96,107,148,205,253,278,336,362,396,408,485,24,39,59,227,342,397,427,475,484,41,45,60,142,250,257,371,426,26,53,55,239,246,309,366,424,446,467,471,12,317,407,58,150,202,237,238,274,280,413,438,443,476,1,178,240,276,293,315,395,410,263,444,448,451,11,63,84,103,130,267,281,322,323,387,398,409,418,439,447,61,93,119,30,57,160,231,262,275,181,183,200,235,236,307,351,399,77,85,207,221,302,360,157,203,223,259,270,332,338,29,104,273,283,329,417,453,455,14,180,170,174,179,326,331,341,433,441,161,306,330,334,415,474,71,105,190,206,328,27,134,182,256,359,449,175,177,298,300,389,434,241,353,361,437,477,279,308,352,340,469,62,116,245,452,304,149,94,260,199,251,354,282,159,233,320,357,184,232,252,222,314],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

However, proper grounding and polarity are crucial for safe operation.  A GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet is designed to detect and interrupt a fault current, preventing electrical shock.  While the range itself may not be affected by the GFCI, the GFCI's sensitivity can cause it to trip during normal cycling of the range's electronic components.  This is a nuisance rather than a safety hazard, but it's important to note that the GFCI's presence doesn't negate the need for proper grounding and polarity.  Therefore, while the range can still operate on a GFCI-protected circuit, it's recommended to avoid using one to prevent unnecessary tripping.\n","source":"data/test/kfgg504kps.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[9,17,5,4,13,31,18,41,12,21,48,24,35,44,1,46,3,55,34,65,68,10,15,26,59,37,38,49,54,58,64,11,14,25,50,52,32,43,47,33,42,61,29,45,56,66,69,23,8,2,63,19,39,71,22,30,70,7,67,40,16,20,28,36,53,6,57,51,27,62,60],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How might the \"Display by image rating\" jump method be useful for efficiently reviewing a large collection of photos, and what potential limitation does it have?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[622],"raw_output":"","pred":"The \"Display by image rating\" jump method allows users to quickly navigate through their photos based on their assigned ratings. This can be incredibly useful for efficiently reviewing a large collection of photos, especially when users want to focus on specific types of images. For example, if a user has rated their photos with stars, they can use this method to jump directly to all photos with a rating of 3 stars or higher, or to all photos with a rating of 1 star or lower. This saves time and effort compared to scrolling through every photo individually.\n\nHowever, a potential limitation of this method is that it only displays images with ratings. It does not show all images, regardless of whether they have ratings or not. This means that users who want to see all their photos, regardless of their ratings, would need to use a different jump method. Additionally, if users have not assigned ratings to all their photos, this method might not be as useful, as it would not provide a complete overview of the photo collection.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[622,566,518,617,563,311,511,561,680,87,521,4,180,309,184,618,6,565,187,303,562,615,679,623,301,522,532,533,312,519,621,836,516,627,692,859,875,319,689,910,529,572,607,614,514,564,575,580,619,842,631,634,812,512,546,557,513,624,628,9,411,527,543,569,630,651,19,318,525,531,574,578,714,877,191,196,310,333,608,743,7,197,335,523,666,668,694,721,786,834,843,119,395,534,596,633,636,195,216,255,308,331,548,573,576,893,218,332,412,413,554,571,696,699,813,852,854,120,283,286,337,343,552,678,5,73,315,317,601,603,629,313,324,459,550,556,559,592,595,626,83,277,320,322,398,590,591,660,794,856,885,125,127,258,328,330,558,612,664,894,110,179,185,267,334,541,567,798,853,121,189,393,517,535,549,570,616,640,658,691,693,787,857,194,326,341,387,493,537,577,582,598,600,609,665,695,701,708,791,835,881,122,124,186,316,376,381,502,515,520,545,579,594,613,672,739,814,892,85,91,108,138,153,214,291,544,606,663,681,707,810,846,860,141,159,181,321,348,402,602,653,656,670,677,57,90,94,104,284,306,327,344,366,391,415,524,581,593,605,611,625,675,753,776,792,849,855,3,10,84,112,161,254,279,323,336,356,463,468,586,646,654,858,886,102,202,266,268,325,357,365,446,471,597,635,878,49,117,167,193,217,228,539,547,568,587,589,620,722,731,736,775,821,872,29,39,109,123,205,269,280,282,290,295,377,401,530,536,588,599,642,682,706,741,763,848,868,876,898,50,81,136,139,152,190,232,235,262,281,299,367,373,382,414,498,509,555,632,674,715,718,729,760,767,815,911,132,219,221,227,239,253,273,274,338,350,384,460,479,481,508,697,724,758,880,101,154,157,188,203,211,374,380,496,499,553,662,700,732,747,768,782,796,799,869,897,913,25,28,51,107,118,199,230,233,292,345,354,406,417,424,430,501,669,710,757,777,789,790,797,803,832,888,95,96,158,163,213,342,432,480,526,551,583,604,837,99,113,114,140,171,215,287,364,408,435,440,483,703,709,733,745,820,34,60,69,111,151,160,183,209,298,304,359,362,389,416,486,610,702,711,847,92,129,240,329,452,466,641,698,805,807,8,31,38,88,137,192,260,353,487,510,79,93,106,207,307,349,372,497,500,819,212,236,278,407,410,478,542,650,661,688,806,56,76,100,142,206,224,305,355,392,433,495,652,655,673,705,723,870,52,294,404,436,447,457,560,667,738,764,808,26,71,98,115,241,243,250,259,340,361,378,540,730,795,850,895,900,15,53,270,285,300,371,420,637,683,717,725,742,778,785,866,889,891,902,916,21,116,174,198,244,314,375,394,584,671,783,802,896,86,156,275,276,360,368,421,423,441,454,491,494,766,771,801,18,442,451,467,538,645,647,690,713,770,788,804,887,901,134,289,456,488,657,751,809,914,155,234,237,242,379,450,506,712,727,840,46,170,172,261,386,426,428,482,687,719,752,818,89,103,182,246,352,358,383,390,399,405,429,473,503,648,735,746,769,800,851,917,82,126,164,168,288,296,302,419,528,874,909,54,80,223,248,264,293,438,458,477,772,774,816,862,864,97,131,148,165,249,257,388,409,431,470,676,761,823,833,883,130,147,200,263,272,297,418,485,585,720,737,826,867,251,339,475,490,639,740,762,773,1,12,45,128,173,208,225,448,793,863,879,222,229,396,474,861,58,162,403,465,489,492,643,704,765,61,105,178,256,385,434,443,507,659,744,784,871,72,422,686,726,750,873,33,62,135,204,210,346,455,464,716,781,908,48,175,427,734,829,838,47,150,245,252,363,425,453,22,169,220,445,469,476,649,685,748,845,865,40,43,484,505,728,844,16,226,265,271,754,780,830,899,68,145,238,27,44,397,461,906,20,149,247,449,472,817,177,779,919,462,756,839,907,23,70,77,439,822,35,176,828,11,32,37,74,78,644,684,755,827,17,24,133,146,444,825,905,42,66,890,918,369,30,201,882,904,166,351,75,370,400,437,2,504,759,63,67,144,231,347,841,41,64,915,749,13,36,638,811,59,65,824,831,14,912,884,903,55,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What are the differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds between the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter in still photo shooting, and how do these settings impact the use of flash?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[908],"raw_output":"","pred":"In still photo shooting, the mechanical shutter offers a wider range of shutter speeds from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, including Bulb mode, with a set increment of 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop. The X-sync speed for the mechanical shutter is 1/200 sec. In contrast, the electronic 1st curtain shutter has a narrower range of shutter speeds from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, also including Bulb mode, with the same set increment of 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop. The X-sync speed for the electronic 1st curtain shutter is 1/250 sec.\n\nThese differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds impact the use of flash in several ways. The wider range of shutter speeds for the mechanical shutter allows for more flexibility in capturing fast-moving subjects or in low-light conditions, as the shutter can be set to slower speeds. However, the electronic 1st curtain shutter, with its faster X-sync speed, is more suitable for high-speed flash photography, as it can synchronize with the flash at a faster shutter speed, reducing the risk of motion blur and ensuring that the flash is effective even at higher shutter speeds. This makes the electronic 1st curtain shutter ideal for capturing fast-moving subjects with flash, while the mechanical shutter is better for slower shutter speeds and more controlled flash synchronization.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[908,161,162,910,174,177,298,299,170,869,164,384,163,344,870,179,500,868,165,499,150,286,218,181,291,894,899,293,3,294,296,887,4,224,905,906,184,223,297,874,195,339,147,826,116,152,204,132,172,336,417,825,840,131,144,312,681,135,502,113,157,387,688,830,833,838,867,892,133,145,173,180,313,388,75,156,212,167,215,308,185,301,348,350,904,137,140,338,349,72,74,176,96,159,199,219,269,432,791,824,837,885,206,821,898,149,380,849,122,130,143,155,295,352,818,909,5,115,136,300,335,102,211,503,843,57,175,198,221,316,345,871,913,50,168,205,333,828,886,889,891,114,134,169,253,138,171,376,872,151,318,395,83,202,213,226,282,337,434,829,77,119,139,158,207,216,407,35,285,394,726,127,178,355,382,460,835,153,186,209,343,393,405,633,112,182,214,274,341,367,392,739,183,200,266,76,81,94,277,278,281,836,91,324,386,419,492,795,832,20,193,275,381,383,841,290,303,442,596,630,2,89,187,210,486,615,789,839,34,80,95,188,228,241,248,262,307,311,317,323,374,437,469,866,106,121,203,267,268,276,391,471,787,806,33,90,107,120,148,160,217,321,418,732,817,897,31,87,92,98,192,231,279,280,707,93,97,100,283,284,496,700,822,108,146,190,334,340,875,32,104,189,232,314,385,433,446,458,501,808,110,287,406,429,454,476,508,888,99,124,166,257,330,342,411,450,459,485,541,579,7,85,239,420,489,28,264,320,487,616,8,73,105,117,118,390,641,763,842,884,18,225,265,315,463,488,807,834,878,61,70,84,103,288,322,474,493,504,674,809,6,17,123,194,201,230,252,309,326,328,438,447,509,511,661,788,907,67,208,449,738,810,863,880,25,78,451,786,815,877,254,365,366,416,436,445,587,624,666,895,26,42,111,443,475,675,733,758,760,38,109,222,234,235,260,423,428,430,461,512,519,537,557,590,725,794,54,101,196,242,261,271,289,319,331,864,914,86,129,351,507,577,585,653,659,59,125,233,247,258,378,422,431,481,667,697,711,762,812,823,126,236,246,306,346,353,531,544,197,396,468,483,540,621,628,844,858,82,237,368,371,441,505,873,240,372,373,421,425,426,455,497,792,27,154,229,347,424,453,631,636,642,677,698,71,88,227,238,245,305,327,332,427,477,597,614,663,737,896,244,250,357,413,495,612,651,715,816,820,854,325,401,440,467,498,543,607,632,695,736,800,802,354,400,457,464,568,618,669,671,673,742,778,790,797,9,142,369,479,480,526,528,529,539,583,634,660,679,734,798,805,911,60,220,259,439,466,708,743,65,255,270,272,273,359,482,538,640,683,689,705,717,718,727,783,304,399,402,462,470,490,513,514,516,527,534,542,582,603,617,620,622,645,676,703,710,714,752,776,22,364,409,452,465,472,494,520,545,561,576,588,602,662,709,735,744,745,793,819,52,403,525,535,604,649,650,657,685,690,721,755,761,861,912,79,243,398,518,532,567,601,639,652,654,682,731,30,128,478,484,510,572,600,629,648,655,680,722,764,777,21,51,63,435,448,536,562,635,701,704,712,741,766,801,902,916,251,444,560,605,637,706,730,782,785,827,883,16,191,414,558,569,608,647,658,672,699,740,813,881,45,46,62,404,523,625,696,724,831,862,893,903,19,24,360,379,491,552,686,694,719,723,751,767,846,853,855,900,10,44,64,370,410,456,584,586,609,665,670,720,746,753,799,901,36,292,329,412,524,613,729,771,40,69,408,415,473,549,578,589,716,775,780,796,851,310,517,565,573,598,623,643,656,687,693,702,748,749,754,768,804,23,43,47,49,515,547,556,559,591,362,522,530,551,553,570,574,575,592,610,668,249,377,521,580,581,664,678,747,857,859,141,550,611,644,692,781,845,11,15,58,68,619,765,784,865,1,56,571,546,564,594,595,713,848,256,506,533,554,599,684,750,779,860,66,356,626,774,847,850,555,691,856,263,375,563,890,29,358,361,728,772,548,593,606,757,759,876,53,566,769,770,773,882,389,646,37,39,811,879,915,919,852,302,756,41,14,917,397,814,627,48,13,363,803,12,55,638,918],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This flipping process, combined with the \"Multiple Page\" setting, allowed for the creation of a compact, booklet-style document from the original single-sided page.\n","source":"data/test/mfcj1010dw.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[89,70,82,81,73,77,515,69,136,137,503,3,64,74,83,66,68,84,86,362,143,173,71,410,133,138,363,126,141,139,88,91,129,2,132,48,92,506,174,411,456,119,51,49,76,419,50,152,492,15,478,65,134,165,408,166,135,476,487,211,467,486,507,87,93,120,142,178,234,457,140,153,208,483,517,39,90,209,407,412,128,207,491,94,130,210,495,37,148,160,497,513,514,520,529,455,474,498,527,530,43,103,118,161,249,54,55,104,123,131,149,199,276,279,417,528,5,101,271,482,502,30,107,154,172,206,240,406,17,24,57,121,155,162,197,201,413,454,274,292,349,477,512,27,56,171,175,180,215,261,336,466,52,106,168,184,202,204,221,62,117,127,146,167,182,510,203,219,275,440,449,484,505,40,45,105,108,147,156,214,239,277,308,323,386,416,443,522,79,98,429,475,4,36,41,47,116,372,415,59,111,170,179,217,354,383,489,97,144,195,235,324,364,371,414,418,430,459,462,6,34,38,100,278,436,448,458,157,193,198,259,352,370,378,384,387,424,452,479,488,493,504,532,46,264,267,356,16,18,35,58,80,169,293,302,346,420,447,22,29,53,72,189,223,253,450,500,75,231,280,357,388,397,445,42,158,159,226,272,283,285,382,409,425,61,176,245,282,287,366,438,460,13,21,232,233,241,355,396,428,431,432,433,490,508,509,516,531,28,177,187,188,191,151,164,224,229,250,281,297,338,393,472,526,10,33,112,113,216,255,319,337,359,361,380,392,468,481,67,150,163,194,200,270,300,353,401,446,453,521,96,222,251,260,322,347,365,375,404,426,471,20,44,102,246,248,262,314,339,368,376,377,394,395,399,423,19,23,183,228,236,243,244,501,85,225,263,286,299,360,398,444,257,298,331,124,190,212,242,304,333,385,442,523,524,26,99,115,145,192,254,268,291,341,374,441,12,31,63,334,358,402,427,434,499,8,9,326,422,470,511,95,230,345,405,25,125,181,519,535,238,288,295,332,391,469,494,496,196,307,342,367,473,533,186,258,303,330,220,305,316,379,381,464,485,114,306,309,318,451,14,213,227,237,266,335,340,344,525,78,109,110,122,265,296,313,315,437,252,273,312,348,389,421,301,317,327,328,351,32,289,311,329,185,290,373,465,1,218,284,294,320,480,518,534,310,205,247,321,435,439,60,11,390,350,369,325,403,463,7,269,256,343,400,461],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How does the image suggest you should adjust the paper guides when loading envelopes in the paper tray?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[46],"raw_output":"","pred":"The image shows a close-up of the paper tray with the paper width guides (1) and paper length guide (2) visible. The guide for the width (1) is shown being adjusted by a hand, while the length guide (2) is also being adjusted. The text accompanying the image states: \"Gently press and slide the paper width guides (1) and paper length guide (2) to fit the size of the envelopes.\"\n\nTo adjust the paper guides when loading envelopes, you should:\n\n1. Pull out the paper tray completely.\n2. Lift the output paper tray cover.\n3. Gently press and slide the paper width guides (1) to fit the width of the envelopes.\n4. Slide the paper length guide (2) to fit the length of the envelopes.\n5. Make sure the envelopes are flat in the tray.\n6. Close the output paper tray cover.\n7. Slowly push the paper tray completely into the machine.\n8. Pull out the paper support (1) until it locks into place, and then unfold the paper support flap (2).\n\nThe image visually demonstrates how to adjust the guides by showing a hand moving the width guide. This suggests that you should carefully slide the guides in or out to match the dimensions of your envelopes, ensuring they are snug but not too tight. This will help prevent the envelopes from shifting during printing and ensure proper paper feed.","source":"data/test/mfcj1010dw.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[39,46,43,37,410,42,375,411,38,45,377,41,50,47,44,450,401,396,402,404,36,399,40,405,54,2,55,382,448,51,57,449,497,59,381,52,70,412,56,66,446,466,506,35,89,127,376,65,503,362,455,528,363,371,456,73,87,380,427,383,505,515,409,24,128,142,397,408,49,33,81,138,6,120,61,84,116,174,141,420,433,458,459,76,394,457,83,378,469,437,470,118,130,132,392,34,121,398,123,129,467,393,117,345,468,48,512,5,384,510,69,88,133,403,435,272,407,447,58,64,119,137,395,135,148,236,443,478,520,235,400,147,212,479,131,140,347,373,419,77,115,332,374,454,474,517,532,190,436,3,10,62,92,139,199,233,337,354,483,514,29,53,91,223,280,482,134,198,201,252,271,379,453,475,507,144,149,331,480,484,501,513,74,153,160,211,254,414,17,68,224,273,406,460,502,529,136,168,189,229,234,498,527,4,15,111,222,316,418,461,485,500,522,16,22,23,67,71,79,156,232,314,416,434,531,106,143,239,253,255,338,346,372,388,487,151,155,178,231,240,342,349,465,477,523,31,82,100,162,173,249,353,492,508,166,315,328,415,25,80,165,216,333,340,352,489,530,30,104,152,167,243,386,413,451,521,18,75,97,98,112,124,163,215,276,319,322,438,441,101,126,180,193,208,244,264,292,308,327,365,426,90,103,169,176,202,203,206,226,228,278,360,430,171,186,302,330,339,385,440,452,476,491,524,13,107,108,150,157,183,230,268,275,279,285,341,357,428,431,194,196,221,242,281,284,293,306,323,334,336,348,350,445,499,28,93,182,214,217,282,307,344,364,442,495,519,172,179,188,197,248,260,261,317,356,370,417,424,425,533,14,19,27,94,99,159,225,241,300,343,391,481,494,526,105,158,204,210,218,219,301,309,387,488,504,509,164,175,245,263,313,329,422,20,181,187,227,258,266,289,294,351,390,472,113,154,161,195,247,250,305,312,486,26,72,102,184,265,267,270,286,464,274,297,325,355,432,463,209,298,335,389,534,251,1,246,277,303,423,493,535,21,32,146,207,269,290,324,368,96,114,170,191,200,283,287,299,473,110,291,7,78,288,304,518,359,471,8,205,237,259,421,516,220,311,85,318,321,122,262,295,320,429,192,444,511,525,9,60,145,310,366,11,86,109,177,238,369,462,257,296,63,256,326,367,496,185,439,490,125,358,361,95,213,12],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

If the file type is not supported, you may need to convert the file to a different format that is compatible with the service.\n\n2. **Save as Different Type**: If the file type is supported but still causes the error, try saving the file as a different type. This can sometimes resolve compatibility issues.\n\n3. **Check for Corruptions**: Verify if the file is corrupted. You can do this by opening the file in a text editor or a file viewer to check for any errors or inconsistencies. If the file is corrupted, you will need to obtain a new, uncorrupted version of the file.\n\n4. **Service Restrictions**: If the file type and size are within the service's limits, but the error persists, check the service's specific restrictions or guidelines for file types and formats. Sometimes, there are additional requirements that are not immediately obvious.\n\n5. **Contact Service Support**: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact the service's support team for further assistance.

{"question":"What are the differences between the \"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" and \"True Gray\" scan types, and in what scenarios might you choose one over the other?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[119],"raw_output":"","pred":"The \"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" and \"True Gray\" scan types differ in their approach to creating grayscale images:\n\nGray (Error Diffusion) uses a method called error diffusion to simulate gray tones without using true gray dots. It places black dots in a specific pattern to create a gray appearance. This method is simpler and faster, making it suitable for quick scans or when high-speed processing is necessary. However, it may not produce as accurate or smooth grayscale images as True Gray.\n\nTrue Gray, on the other hand, uses up to 256 shades of gray to scan the image.

{"question":"What is the maximum ambient temperature for operating the TE 2000-22 cordless breaker, and how does this compare to the maximum storage temperature? Discuss the implications of these temperature limits on the tool's performance and longevity in extreme working conditions.","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[26],"raw_output":"","pred":"The maximum ambient temperature for operating the TE 2000-22 cordless breaker is 60°C, while the maximum storage temperature is 70°C. This indicates that the tool is designed to function effectively within a relatively wide range of temperatures, from -17°C to 60°C during operation and from -20°C to 70°C during storage.\n\nThe higher storage temperature compared to the operating temperature suggests that the tool can withstand higher temperatures during storage but may not perform optimally at these elevated temperatures during use. This difference is crucial for users who may store the tool in warmer environments, such as workshops or vehicles, but need to ensure it remains functional during colder working conditions.\n\nThe temperature limits have significant implications for the tool's performance and longevity. Operating the tool at temperatures outside its specified range can lead to reduced efficiency, increased wear, and potential damage to internal components. For instance, prolonged exposure to high temperatures during operation can cause overheating, which can degrade battery performance and reduce the tool's lifespan. Conversely, operating the tool at very low temperatures can hinder its performance, as the battery may not function as efficiently, leading to shorter run times and reduced power output.\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and longevity, users should operate and store the TE 2000-22 within its recommended temperature ranges. Proper maintenance and storage practices, such as avoiding extreme temperatures and ensuring the tool is allowed to cool down before and after use, can help extend its operational life and maintain its effectiveness.","source":"data/test/nuron_te_200022.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[26,88,14,63,172,225,75,199,124,212,38,82,50,76,148,112,136,160,57,231,166,186,59,10,20,29,5,192,32,44,94,100,107,144,181,8,69,1,60,218,11,23,179,28,201,205,24,142,178,22,154,67,203,187,30,42,51,84,95,101,182,183,189,196,79,174,40,156,34,98,188,150,193,132,162,190,9,12,110,185,73,92,164,74,104,145,18,85,46,120,15,80,137,21,113,168,169,195,197,16,58,102,152,41,61,66,118,157,175,158,176,180,214,64,35,184,194,45,96,130,134,204,210,217,83,222,54,70,90,97,114,121,213,219,25,49,91,209,33,202,47,62,71,220,39,105,125,227,78,93,17,65,108,126,143,232,3,77,99,127,133,135,171,216,37,48,53,87,226,55,72,86,111,19,89,109,119,138,149,155,200,223,224,230,52,103,206,13,27,36,131,147,208,228,161,170,117,153,128,215,229,68,159,163,207,221,140,122,139,43,146,4,116,56,81,129,177,106,151,191,2,123,141,211,7,115,167,31,173,236,198,165,6,233,234,235],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

It's important to note that the amber line is only active when the system is turned on and functioning properly.\n","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[530,533,134,139,166,167,135,537,111,531,391,532,113,33,504,112,536,770,534,535,222,605,443,48,555,49,20,170,476,511,561,19,213,393,10,34,165,212,214,509,574,470,216,556,161,437,575,159,160,501,542,122,162,477,599,141,454,563,643,71,201,129,521,527,17,101,123,420,466,522,622,157,471,168,92,117,625,685,734,441,502,507,729,126,127,154,580,164,481,591,259,267,486,629,108,482,485,118,128,179,264,328,540,721,104,155,169,356,490,500,632,645,705,116,188,377,462,492,268,474,526,631,728,140,313,317,137,178,512,618,120,131,276,461,541,578,628,719,183,320,378,467,560,581,637,655,254,321,392,403,424,425,439,460,469,480,495,508,682,37,114,153,156,209,257,478,483,516,525,570,766,105,142,152,196,207,329,390,515,520,577,593,710,274,423,601,636,769,115,243,255,294,472,506,524,565,592,644,660,768,15,29,30,56,93,121,136,147,163,262,263,279,318,452,519,667,737,12,89,150,208,311,347,491,151,158,236,389,468,489,493,514,548,564,587,28,61,171,314,497,510,554,630,24,36,45,81,143,319,382,458,463,544,584,597,652,686,713,733,145,195,242,250,394,453,499,539,558,609,611,646,765,27,76,77,138,335,348,590,624,664,771,62,97,102,404,455,457,528,588,596,627,676,744,764,8,73,119,144,149,286,309,324,327,517,546,582,610,614,22,83,91,96,107,330,473,600,651,72,124,246,353,479,488,503,518,567,594,702,732,767,244,315,523,551,606,647,677,748,38,82,100,205,241,283,384,431,459,487,543,706,731,99,109,125,148,186,200,211,270,280,341,545,626,648,722,755,69,249,275,316,464,573,688,704,743,60,94,293,310,409,450,484,615,634,640,691,707,736,67,110,130,221,289,292,350,379,396,401,446,494,529,579,663,712,716,726,756,174,177,181,193,199,247,307,397,400,465,557,623,730,739,95,133,187,190,204,297,363,538,559,583,585,607,717,16,26,78,202,210,239,248,278,281,421,505,550,641,53,106,227,237,245,269,288,323,399,498,612,619,654,4,32,64,74,85,87,132,189,228,235,253,282,340,388,407,422,440,613,703,25,31,43,146,180,322,408,549,562,602,608,642,750,9,75,306,349,427,435,715,2,50,198,295,305,338,351,436,475,595,604,697,723,745,18,23,88,173,220,287,308,336,405,456,496,569,576,586,620,695,738,740,773,57,59,80,172,203,285,395,708,735,65,197,251,325,331,447,451,635,711,718,720,84,98,215,343,438,513,589,621,687,58,192,252,303,312,339,361,417,566,725,754,21,39,234,273,284,352,406,568,598,617,675,751,14,42,47,194,218,256,271,333,444,633,649,681,683,742,55,86,206,217,219,238,240,334,414,547,669,689,701,224,296,298,301,344,418,433,616,653,772,11,46,226,231,291,304,326,412,449,603,694,741,7,70,184,229,290,332,650,656,673,749,63,66,191,258,266,387,552,553,13,41,51,103,230,233,380,398,402,571,692,79,277,360,415,639,668,693,699,752,68,232,302,337,364,383,428,670,35,432,445,657,690,700,1,5,265,662,714,747,175,225,680,182,355,419,684,724,6,223,371,411,661,762,261,362,410,430,659,709,185,366,370,416,429,434,658,572,666,3,44,176,346,367,698,727,260,272,300,342,426,672,760,365,671,674,679,757,54,358,368,448,678,357,372,665,381,354,753,374,52,299,369,413,345,385,759,386,758,375,359,376,373,638,763,40,696,761,90,442,746],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}
{"question":"What potential safety concern could arise if the trunk opener is accidentally activated while driving, and how might this relate to the vehicle's design?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[189],"raw_output":"","pred":"If the trunk opener is accidentally activated while driving, a potential safety concern could arise due to the vehicle's design. The trunk opener is designed to be easily accessible on the driver's door, which is located near the driver's seat. This proximity to the driver's controls increases the likelihood of accidental activation.\n\nThe trunk opener is intended to be used when the vehicle is stationary, typically to open the trunk lid. However, if it is activated while driving, it could cause the trunk lid to open suddenly. This sudden opening could lead to several safety issues:\n\n1. **Distraction**: The driver's attention could be momentarily diverted from the road, increasing the risk of accidents.\n2. **Vehicle instability**: The sudden movement of the trunk lid could affect the vehicle's balance and stability, especially if the trunk is not fully closed.\n3. **Injury**: The trunk lid could potentially hit the driver or passengers, causing injuries.\n4. **Property damage**: The trunk lid could damage nearby objects or structures if it opens unexpectedly.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, the vehicle's design should include features such as a trunk lid lock mechanism that prevents sudden opening and clear warnings about the trunk opener's function and potential hazards. Additionally, the placement of the trunk opener should be reconsidered to reduce the likelihood of accidental activation while driving.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[189,193,88,12,45,47,713,23,221,191,76,454,399,116,452,490,525,634,174,453,82,83,178,192,507,599,766,43,184,190,476,519,524,614,618,627,89,176,179,460,613,745,710,715,743,180,198,620,628,716,9,38,195,239,457,462,470,539,77,492,508,530,641,688,46,471,500,511,529,561,655,744,765,37,177,201,207,209,215,356,445,477,515,520,629,363,458,509,683,724,728,36,81,112,450,491,555,704,769,8,468,472,478,537,540,581,637,697,705,171,196,216,465,687,771,51,75,80,444,526,532,672,14,33,39,242,245,275,528,720,731,42,50,78,479,480,517,681,2,56,98,102,105,154,236,241,435,474,494,590,663,695,722,732,742,34,238,274,330,463,473,475,574,633,691,739,96,204,229,251,259,518,521,538,612,660,685,694,706,725,729,73,93,99,106,108,218,223,447,501,523,578,621,622,675,702,768,48,49,71,111,212,227,286,459,466,502,503,560,575,632,31,57,115,203,222,237,279,439,469,516,531,559,605,606,609,615,700,723,734,735,767,113,181,183,194,199,244,253,270,400,404,527,548,549,585,607,610,616,619,642,667,740,770,18,53,61,69,87,94,97,187,231,335,401,455,461,536,567,593,608,611,631,650,699,730,737,74,103,104,143,200,210,220,224,243,314,347,353,449,451,506,522,556,577,601,626,649,658,709,719,22,127,219,225,235,325,425,557,565,584,589,592,635,664,693,754,16,52,197,396,456,533,569,573,598,624,668,15,59,62,66,86,95,160,202,228,339,437,446,467,495,498,499,544,580,583,726,733,5,30,85,92,110,128,161,248,348,440,443,493,497,510,513,550,568,673,714,748,755,756,7,10,107,109,166,234,328,331,355,405,422,482,535,639,640,659,662,689,60,67,101,313,402,441,504,554,596,602,603,711,750,17,24,54,55,58,142,155,182,205,208,240,340,407,486,512,579,582,591,647,657,692,703,721,35,41,44,79,100,129,134,162,185,211,280,282,427,431,563,651,686,712,747,762,63,72,121,169,186,188,324,341,542,562,576,586,594,623,764,21,65,117,175,297,309,343,350,370,394,403,483,543,570,588,595,630,643,701,708,717,4,29,32,139,281,292,305,364,393,464,481,484,505,547,564,644,698,727,84,278,600,684,25,126,213,214,249,277,349,636,665,690,752,757,68,333,426,432,545,566,114,120,334,417,448,587,604,13,255,306,357,485,707,170,271,423,496,514,666,760,6,27,137,141,164,206,252,276,283,534,625,736,741,140,168,217,377,420,424,656,159,254,268,327,329,408,546,654,759,20,70,118,131,246,263,391,395,414,153,354,438,541,551,597,676,144,148,267,326,617,165,250,303,352,374,409,558,572,680,138,304,390,429,488,652,679,19,167,226,264,298,552,645,653,671,718,40,247,338,346,489,682,753,262,362,436,487,669,758,91,132,285,337,389,661,28,152,289,296,315,382,442,738,119,147,172,230,293,307,332,342,367,380,383,398,406,412,11,90,123,257,295,670,751,3,151,232,320,360,366,421,571,150,156,233,319,371,387,392,284,291,299,323,358,369,411,157,317,345,379,419,677,746,135,301,310,434,553,638,646,674,258,272,26,133,378,433,749,136,149,163,410,415,648,772,64,428,311,361,418,696,158,318,321,678,124,294,302,336,368,122,273,308,416,761,773,125,265,269,365,130,146,288,381,385,397,344,384,430,145,256,413,1,173,359,351,763,260,287,261,372,373,266,316,290,322,388,376,300,375,312,386],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

By adjusting the threshold, you can ensure that you receive timely warnings without being unnecessarily alarmed by minor speed deviations.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[392,140,141,393,137,600,139,168,391,120,115,154,114,116,541,556,533,121,125,584,155,594,129,543,123,162,205,396,136,159,502,561,575,383,531,564,143,188,378,388,394,530,138,142,157,178,766,179,323,559,169,182,222,384,599,770,118,377,379,181,526,699,509,631,20,380,395,170,520,538,511,558,764,173,313,453,540,183,303,675,768,389,196,241,261,385,457,497,574,771,45,93,144,210,213,387,390,466,500,628,119,186,386,397,494,767,103,151,180,242,260,304,620,662,153,200,208,227,258,321,551,21,150,286,382,422,527,697,769,202,362,489,542,611,10,126,147,259,298,319,406,441,495,508,630,651,27,104,255,364,440,487,519,521,577,578,601,649,686,748,102,145,172,224,338,421,498,501,576,585,590,613,11,19,109,214,285,337,470,496,507,510,522,562,563,593,706,756,5,22,211,251,412,431,432,443,458,460,463,555,726,88,198,415,472,546,581,602,636,652,681,31,73,89,134,201,209,218,399,532,539,557,572,623,625,714,7,117,225,238,315,438,447,490,512,544,565,615,637,641,2,8,244,398,525,604,618,6,92,110,111,231,249,320,423,439,493,553,647,679,723,728,731,735,26,33,46,171,223,265,295,330,332,425,429,467,570,592,616,722,749,765,34,43,165,195,326,381,456,481,486,491,545,591,627,691,9,17,29,76,152,156,167,193,270,299,549,580,614,633,712,235,271,288,312,329,417,459,462,552,560,568,609,622,665,668,745,30,133,158,199,264,283,287,314,318,356,408,414,420,450,506,528,529,678,680,683,750,37,39,101,293,339,371,445,452,524,554,634,650,676,702,758,108,190,220,237,245,257,266,278,279,292,307,309,322,325,334,343,455,492,499,503,505,733,752,60,81,106,177,192,203,230,250,277,289,363,405,478,518,547,548,603,626,657,707,716,724,727,14,32,42,48,52,95,176,197,215,229,239,276,282,434,461,536,567,646,655,694,704,705,730,751,65,75,99,148,243,269,305,340,410,418,435,471,473,476,485,514,523,573,667,677,710,739,747,15,216,281,327,347,350,370,437,448,474,477,480,645,695,713,729,742,49,61,71,77,166,191,240,254,262,267,272,273,328,402,404,464,605,607,624,684,759,772,59,94,124,189,207,236,274,317,324,353,354,424,465,482,550,610,612,663,666,685,57,69,130,160,256,291,310,419,427,479,721,760,44,54,72,78,128,161,163,348,430,513,515,534,635,639,692,12,85,132,247,290,294,296,369,409,566,571,606,687,740,36,98,234,308,400,598,23,219,221,306,360,436,469,586,589,656,659,688,709,761,70,149,217,569,56,62,79,105,301,341,352,449,454,488,596,597,629,753,63,246,253,280,416,535,595,660,689,762,74,86,297,336,367,374,643,38,80,100,122,131,252,355,368,516,212,359,407,504,588,682,725,47,66,146,174,194,268,331,587,736,68,112,113,537,582,754,13,25,50,97,284,342,403,475,648,658,700,16,67,302,316,703,717,83,87,206,357,411,446,483,640,719,732,737,755,248,300,365,426,644,664,711,743,18,24,358,433,757,58,91,96,263,335,349,698,41,127,366,451,484,693,720,734,55,351,376,3,35,164,226,233,333,346,632,4,444,673,701,361,401,619,621,84,228,345,372,715,135,185,428,690,744,773,184,311,517,617,204,413,669,28,375,583,642,53,82,175,275,608,187,232,344,468,670,674,718,579,51,64,373,653,107,763,661,672,708,40,90,738,741,1,654,671,638,696,442,746],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What is the key difference between the WARNING and CAUTION safety messages in terms of potential consequences?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[7],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key difference between WARNING and CAUTION safety messages lies in the potential consequences of not following the instructions:\n\nA WARNING message indicates a higher risk of serious injury or death if instructions are not followed. It uses language like \"You CAN be KILLED or SERIOUSLY HURT\" to emphasize the severe potential consequences.\n\nIn contrast, a CAUTION message indicates a lower risk of injury, typically just physical harm if instructions are not followed. It uses language like \"You CAN be HURT\" to describe the potential consequences.\n\nThe WARNING message is more severe and urgent, highlighting the potential for life-threatening situations. It is used for critical safety information that could prevent serious injury or death.\n\nThe CAUTION message is more moderate, indicating potential physical harm but not necessarily life-threatening situations. It is used for important safety information that could prevent minor injuries.\n\nIn summary, WARNING messages carry a higher level of urgency and potential severity, while CAUTION messages provide important safety information with a lower risk of injury. Both are crucial for ensuring safe vehicle operation, but the WARNING messages are more critical for preventing serious harm.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[7,620,89,223,241,242,713,2,452,627,681,687,218,641,229,525,655,225,519,685,76,694,46,77,78,88,198,538,745,195,220,54,75,215,559,614,675,683,688,613,224,539,52,71,86,634,663,710,716,80,237,702,704,724,728,729,709,679,81,231,447,742,115,45,767,660,692,139,458,530,391,10,770,465,526,363,667,238,507,533,659,695,154,699,625,642,42,399,449,500,192,633,93,116,730,457,666,120,462,200,621,665,210,251,510,33,43,103,137,444,731,235,673,121,618,4,168,664,715,371,392,492,518,520,57,460,593,651,189,202,591,637,697,580,706,740,119,578,62,184,365,366,446,480,70,155,239,60,498,508,590,201,509,521,769,47,445,771,41,44,79,180,362,628,768,543,153,364,439,6,512,515,165,658,87,564,605,211,735,191,74,221,602,174,606,368,529,575,199,689,754,53,66,370,471,524,528,733,9,454,493,558,607,686,140,194,31,501,766,18,167,222,236,676,691,726,760,48,443,622,22,82,188,517,574,581,56,393,437,477,572,705,737,34,128,185,274,490,549,555,556,759,176,227,755,72,504,553,568,39,65,92,141,339,662,732,68,95,514,537,560,563,213,455,466,494,540,557,113,209,420,435,511,548,576,629,636,657,693,207,252,297,491,764,5,30,59,106,111,161,193,369,506,544,567,569,104,570,61,83,85,96,127,186,292,516,551,684,19,50,51,98,205,214,325,531,536,612,722,765,110,226,389,532,36,112,286,573,616,656,100,208,245,261,441,499,561,600,609,611,624,649,197,545,585,668,682,707,734,8,259,343,358,394,402,463,474,523,550,577,166,243,360,422,650,102,160,179,349,396,450,472,604,49,63,69,196,248,342,359,440,467,565,571,626,630,73,94,108,117,203,240,459,470,505,547,554,601,615,669,16,109,190,244,301,361,588,67,277,320,374,423,453,478,594,599,632,743,12,84,118,134,171,282,348,496,503,592,748,15,20,37,99,328,424,541,595,639,3,177,183,246,305,382,403,476,562,610,678,750,181,206,285,404,487,534,542,603,631,24,101,175,253,268,304,482,483,597,635,647,720,723,212,338,390,414,427,527,640,714,753,129,143,170,522,546,552,566,587,623,216,276,278,497,596,690,58,105,270,379,535,579,619,677,38,131,135,162,232,323,345,381,385,586,712,727,142,233,350,398,456,747,29,182,187,217,247,298,395,407,461,643,725,756,758,136,164,234,306,319,335,513,598,752,14,178,230,280,321,330,333,367,469,701,11,173,341,405,408,481,489,354,739,749,772,281,293,356,648,718,744,55,228,266,307,337,388,479,608,646,21,25,126,157,159,303,340,373,473,711,719,762,97,169,250,279,428,584,721,736,751,132,156,219,347,411,475,495,32,275,283,295,302,327,375,432,448,464,589,670,708,172,204,352,377,413,23,123,271,355,376,434,438,451,583,698,310,378,380,417,436,468,484,486,502,617,653,17,107,122,148,289,353,387,409,416,288,318,334,372,421,433,680,114,133,147,151,158,255,263,267,299,314,410,485,700,717,149,265,291,357,397,415,671,757,260,313,317,351,401,442,488,582,672,1,144,331,344,346,383,384,400,418,425,430,644,26,138,294,315,324,13,124,125,150,284,296,308,431,652,674,761,773,249,419,429,661,90,309,654,696,290,386,412,254,287,763,40,152,264,645,741,130,329,426,273,322,326,746,28,145,257,258,638,316,262,269,272,35,703,163,300,406,311,27,738,64,332,336,146,312,256,91],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What are three factors that could negatively impact the signal strength of the keyless remote, potentially preventing it from effectively communicating with the vehicle?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[176],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the information provided in the target text, three factors that could negatively impact the signal strength of the keyless remote and potentially prevent it from effectively communicating with the vehicle are:\n\n1. Strong radio waves from nearby equipment: The text states that \"Strong radio waves are being transmitted by nearby equipment\" can inhibit or destabilize communication between the keyless remote and the vehicle. This suggests that electronic devices or other sources of radio frequency interference in the vicinity could interfere with the remote's signal.\n\n2. Carrying the keyless remote with telecommunications equipment: The text notes that \"You are carrying the keyless remote together with telecommunications equipment, laptop computers, cell phones, or wireless devices\" can also cause signal issues. This implies that having electronic devices in close proximity to the remote can interfere with its signal.\n\n3. Metallic objects touching or covering the keyless remote: The text mentions that \"A metallic object is touching or covering the keyless remote\" can prevent the remote from effectively communicating with the vehicle. This suggests that physical obstructions or metallic materials near the remote could block or weaken its signal.\n\nThese factors highlight the importance of maintaining a clear line of sight between the keyless remote and the vehicle's receiver, as well as avoiding interference from electronic devices and metallic objects.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,184,199,450,451,180,190,721,183,452,454,719,178,201,171,38,192,179,769,196,177,182,239,198,687,175,193,455,174,453,697,200,396,181,143,356,634,503,363,727,404,439,43,628,401,424,142,194,205,399,772,422,514,768,9,23,237,537,195,601,618,602,605,770,238,263,394,445,460,462,549,568,311,457,633,685,71,236,499,529,710,744,75,209,241,251,339,523,526,567,600,607,732,37,39,76,297,313,374,444,465,491,500,528,530,531,598,603,622,639,695,725,731,106,116,129,162,342,432,446,478,651,3,207,223,242,309,402,407,472,519,536,548,599,756,2,62,77,220,250,253,427,521,578,589,608,641,681,686,689,713,22,46,197,210,281,306,425,476,493,524,612,656,742,745,764,7,208,222,240,270,355,360,468,513,532,574,606,613,728,735,766,771,29,47,52,56,74,89,286,330,364,400,414,520,525,590,611,620,675,691,706,726,45,48,68,113,212,262,276,352,354,458,470,498,501,507,512,683,729,42,60,66,72,203,346,350,435,463,490,492,515,587,665,694,716,723,765,54,65,88,98,221,259,348,412,466,555,586,614,640,660,688,722,36,59,204,243,246,249,275,277,325,340,406,440,594,595,629,663,720,740,33,49,50,51,58,166,254,341,405,480,539,540,544,579,636,655,662,666,692,714,733,31,57,104,141,317,334,344,349,362,417,436,441,494,585,593,610,627,754,5,8,61,97,100,101,111,188,244,274,336,357,418,535,560,626,699,11,34,35,63,80,81,92,93,102,115,189,191,202,213,215,218,235,282,345,351,474,516,517,522,631,650,690,753,99,105,108,245,280,337,338,367,403,423,447,504,559,730,69,73,95,103,147,155,187,257,258,271,332,333,343,416,420,426,431,433,437,438,459,461,511,534,561,565,596,724,743,758,767,26,256,361,398,550,581,592,609,623,625,635,637,711,21,25,30,82,387,430,443,477,527,664,693,32,225,314,377,428,508,518,556,667,86,96,145,211,285,320,321,464,538,734,14,125,273,283,365,408,471,569,704,715,755,759,83,206,409,421,547,588,702,739,15,67,78,112,123,127,224,411,543,545,619,53,107,310,456,615,680,705,18,134,227,229,307,347,415,429,533,564,573,647,128,216,248,331,371,410,413,576,616,709,747,159,278,295,475,575,584,649,44,79,137,255,279,632,679,335,382,434,467,469,643,677,707,757,16,154,370,380,381,558,186,214,294,366,368,473,510,644,673,703,717,737,109,157,217,292,392,419,479,485,580,604,668,736,4,247,316,324,393,448,566,748,10,27,94,135,167,353,488,583,597,110,160,161,305,509,542,773,17,87,117,298,304,551,557,642,657,762,231,272,328,506,684,12,119,164,252,481,570,138,288,293,326,487,502,630,652,674,41,131,132,168,301,329,358,373,140,266,299,319,378,483,496,554,563,582,760,126,153,264,269,289,296,379,384,391,497,149,226,359,449,659,669,741,6,139,233,234,383,624,712,120,185,390,148,267,284,486,621,750,303,327,591,708,28,85,505,701,24,219,369,553,700,156,232,287,291,318,676,55,118,133,136,150,312,315,386,752,114,122,385,388,389,484,670,121,169,395,482,84,90,322,572,577,19,20,268,302,323,397,617,144,228,495,638,672,682,761,146,151,230,489,546,648,13,40,124,265,571,170,172,442,552,671,165,541,70,152,260,308,696,698,738,372,261,678,718,751,646,658,91,746,376,653,130,290,173,749,1,300,562,645,654,64,763,163,375,661,158],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This feature allows the user to customize the door unlocking behavior to their preference.\n\nChanging the setting of the \"Door Unlock Mode\" can significantly affect the user's experience when approaching their vehicle. If the setting is changed to \"All Doors,\" the driver's door will unlock first, followed by the remaining doors. This can be convenient for users who prefer to enter the vehicle quickly and easily, as they can grab the driver's door handle and have all doors unlocked simultaneously.\n\nOn the other hand, if the setting is changed to \"Driver Door Only,\" only the driver's door will unlock when the driver grabs the driver's door handle. This can be beneficial for users who want to ensure that only the driver can enter the vehicle first, providing an extra layer of security. It can also be useful for users who prefer to enter the vehicle one door at a time, allowing them to check the interior before fully entering.\n\nIn summary, the \"Door Unlock Mode\" feature allows users to customize the door unlocking behavior to suit their specific needs, enhancing the convenience and security of their vehicle access experience.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[394,142,181,182,178,186,396,143,188,388,304,766,205,261,183,227,129,179,193,177,259,509,175,196,764,214,162,392,453,174,200,387,286,577,180,197,288,460,489,545,631,176,540,541,573,584,147,171,531,594,14,136,169,222,278,323,452,457,502,530,556,611,634,138,199,314,496,558,600,38,45,150,305,343,377,379,395,454,459,470,481,491,563,564,583,739,145,160,285,405,424,492,505,520,574,575,606,629,21,298,380,393,461,490,495,543,189,201,282,320,383,412,445,462,485,516,542,576,593,596,619,623,30,139,140,217,313,378,487,544,557,571,578,580,110,115,144,184,198,276,390,432,458,488,515,527,560,561,590,630,723,106,116,190,204,341,406,410,450,513,570,586,603,614,616,768,206,274,350,427,439,486,497,549,555,582,589,591,598,612,118,127,172,382,425,431,465,476,483,510,518,522,533,538,562,769,93,159,185,192,249,398,408,475,524,548,551,552,602,624,37,88,141,213,241,321,340,352,391,455,469,493,553,554,567,579,581,592,617,620,114,168,187,239,289,290,338,346,363,404,463,468,501,534,610,613,622,627,651,120,137,151,194,209,216,275,293,299,397,500,506,511,512,517,559,625,644,652,690,721,740,743,23,73,170,173,211,235,243,303,332,348,389,441,478,479,484,521,525,536,565,599,609,621,626,736,744,97,203,207,210,240,280,315,329,331,333,464,471,507,528,546,601,604,628,772,12,27,34,48,123,191,281,284,334,356,384,385,435,447,451,456,466,477,508,526,529,539,550,587,608,615,618,702,706,32,152,251,271,292,307,417,434,436,440,443,449,472,474,480,482,503,605,632,635,645,716,745,195,212,242,309,312,319,327,407,494,498,499,523,643,756,767,9,20,29,49,58,92,126,247,258,295,318,418,421,519,532,537,547,566,637,673,674,710,17,125,148,154,236,254,270,301,325,326,381,420,438,467,535,585,722,8,244,252,262,360,473,568,569,607,718,132,155,228,263,273,283,310,322,330,400,504,588,686,695,33,47,157,245,253,260,317,337,386,399,414,444,446,448,595,711,2,3,5,22,65,71,102,104,119,246,429,597,699,742,765,153,208,215,234,409,514,704,727,112,238,255,306,311,349,403,419,422,423,688,697,713,726,770,26,67,94,105,133,149,264,266,291,324,344,345,354,426,633,665,668,672,748,771,15,31,76,135,411,433,655,676,708,719,24,25,98,117,146,156,231,257,267,287,402,636,646,649,660,53,131,218,269,294,335,351,416,572,691,694,731,69,83,108,122,272,316,353,374,700,724,725,6,72,85,89,99,113,128,161,202,297,358,413,415,693,728,735,52,56,158,342,361,437,641,647,683,712,720,729,77,109,121,164,166,223,250,256,277,279,328,362,430,715,50,124,226,229,265,685,689,732,754,19,61,111,220,221,237,268,336,640,705,750,36,54,64,82,101,296,347,355,658,675,682,730,733,28,51,63,219,230,300,339,656,707,16,43,96,165,357,648,662,664,698,4,44,46,60,68,74,95,107,248,428,650,687,734,738,753,11,59,66,370,701,714,717,39,42,57,75,130,232,657,681,10,79,134,167,224,233,302,364,371,401,667,55,62,70,100,679,680,757,758,759,773,87,225,639,642,684,18,35,80,308,367,13,84,163,372,659,663,666,678,709,78,103,677,741,41,661,762,91,703,752,365,692,359,669,86,366,7,81,368,369,737,751,760,755,761,671,749,376,747,670,40,90,654,763,1,375,638,653,373,442,696,746],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How can you adjust the print settings to ensure that a document with a pie chart is printed in a smaller size on one sheet and in a larger size on another sheet, while maintaining the layout and proportions of the original document?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[48],"raw_output":"","pred":"To print a document with a pie chart in a smaller size on one sheet and in a larger size on another sheet while maintaining the layout and proportions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Select the Multi-Page Setting**: On the printer driver's Main tab, choose the appropriate Multi-Page setting. For example, if you want to print the pie chart on one sheet and the rest of the document on another, select \"2x1 Poster\" or \"2x2 Poster\" depending on your needs.\n\n2. **Adjust the Print Density**: Go to the More Options tab and select \"User Defined\" under Print Density. This allows you to manually adjust the print density to prevent images from bleeding through to the reverse side. This is crucial for maintaining the clarity and proportions of the pie chart.\n\n3. **Set the Paper Size**: Ensure that the paper size is set to match the size of the sheets you want to print on. For the smaller print, use a smaller paper size, and for the larger print, use a larger paper size.\n\n4. **Print the Document**: Click Print to send the job to the printer. The printer will automatically adjust the size of the pie chart and the rest of the document to fit the selected paper sizes while maintaining the layout and proportions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the pie chart is printed in a smaller size on one sheet and in a larger size on another sheet, with all elements of the document maintaining their original layout and proportions.","source":"data/test/workforce_pro_wf4830_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[68,284,50,76,40,75,48,64,46,47,65,41,67,87,69,58,212,55,117,38,49,66,56,214,60,85,211,44,57,39,219,111,223,123,86,52,54,210,314,27,124,45,81,277,63,74,82,220,121,209,118,225,53,70,205,213,311,42,181,218,276,28,216,8,154,285,291,37,149,51,83,84,162,202,208,200,224,228,2,29,259,59,91,148,94,108,120,147,315,341,122,260,350,43,130,329,73,203,263,22,100,283,23,112,222,26,61,77,97,106,221,227,261,298,72,229,249,32,71,93,199,238,316,328,6,35,204,215,248,267,290,322,323,18,266,286,339,3,62,178,333,80,99,256,270,289,310,325,358,362,194,279,331,353,24,98,166,183,288,312,334,337,342,354,30,110,116,179,262,281,330,336,1,78,90,92,109,127,133,165,193,217,321,324,344,4,5,157,159,195,245,287,355,190,268,278,292,313,326,96,115,128,145,152,197,332,335,338,351,359,105,129,132,172,206,244,343,352,363,36,198,226,241,327,182,345,14,21,33,95,177,207,305,317,340,348,367,131,237,240,251,275,114,119,253,257,365,15,20,34,101,142,155,185,196,201,231,252,293,349,366,12,138,176,233,250,271,274,282,309,347,381,156,169,184,247,346,370,380,126,186,230,258,299,300,139,163,235,239,265,360,368,372,25,31,125,135,137,160,168,180,269,371,376,7,17,146,255,318,13,151,189,356,79,89,102,191,296,301,136,173,272,280,319,382,104,141,153,254,307,164,187,234,242,246,16,144,297,308,320,357,364,375,88,134,243,273,304,361,374,143,161,306,378,107,150,167,170,192,383,174,175,188,373,140,158,113,171,232,236,264,377,11,103,303,295,369,379,10,19,294,302,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

{"question":"What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using the \"Continuous\" file numbering method compared to the \"Auto reset\" and \"Manual reset\" methods when managing large volumes of images across multiple memory cards and folders?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[186],"raw_output":"","pred":"Continuous file numbering offers several advantages when managing large volumes of images across multiple memory cards and folders. The primary benefit is its ability to maintain a consistent file numbering system, ensuring that images are easily identifiable and organized. This method is particularly useful for maintaining a chronological order of images, which can be crucial for projects, events, or long-term archiving. Continuous numbering also simplifies the process of transferring images between different devices or software, as the file numbers remain consistent.\n\nHowever, there are potential disadvantages to consider. If the replacement card or existing folder already contains images recorded previously, the file numbering of the new images may continue from the file numbering of the existing images. This can lead to confusion if the user is not aware of the previous file numbering system, potentially causing duplicate file names or gaps in the numbering sequence. Additionally, if the user wants to start a new project or folder with a fresh numbering system, they must manually reset the file numbering, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nIn contrast, the \"Auto reset\" method restarts the file numbering from 0001 each time the card is replaced or a new folder is created. This method is advantageous for organizing images by cards or folders, ensuring that each new set of images starts from a clean slate. However, it may not be ideal for maintaining a chronological order of images, as the numbering system resets independently of the previous card or folder.\n\nThe \"Manual reset\" method allows for a more controlled approach, where the user can reset the file numbering to 0001 manually or start from file number 0001 in a new folder. This method provides flexibility but requires careful management to avoid inconsistencies in the numbering system.","source":"data/test/eos_4000d.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[186,295,187,278,316,193,52,184,297,318,269,12,181,195,15,17,65,185,288,315,117,290,2,10,285,87,242,317,73,118,252,134,271,171,319,138,180,100,167,230,245,250,273,235,28,248,289,53,101,174,112,202,5,39,261,283,292,66,40,194,277,280,299,38,50,74,154,213,237,279,298,13,88,142,149,166,221,85,96,182,220,259,89,90,145,161,162,165,170,222,249,169,175,286,139,207,268,11,57,61,71,179,198,211,217,253,282,47,158,209,251,8,103,146,173,176,218,246,272,276,284,48,55,60,83,92,99,133,231,239,243,263,287,6,59,79,131,140,212,215,227,16,63,148,155,188,229,264,18,19,24,54,86,121,168,190,226,254,293,41,192,256,296,91,97,128,143,160,214,219,244,281,37,68,111,113,123,191,203,223,225,241,294,30,44,104,163,201,260,313,98,216,228,234,257,258,14,51,70,115,156,196,210,233,265,314,36,64,95,159,164,178,200,247,304,34,130,135,152,183,58,110,147,310,4,62,69,72,75,109,116,172,206,270,275,300,35,42,67,114,122,151,199,208,23,76,189,80,94,127,144,150,224,312,7,9,21,49,129,141,153,157,236,240,20,25,197,262,27,204,320,1,93,124,321,82,45,102,108,177,255,29,132,301,303,126,205,238,77,78,119,307,291,322,106,107,308,137,302,309,3,232,56,136,266,22,43,84,305,81,105,306,120,267,311,46,32,125,274,26,31,33],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What specific action is depicted in the diagram, and why is it important for resolving a printer error related to the FINE cartridges?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[538],"raw_output":"","pred":"The diagram depicts the removal of the FINE cartridges from the printer. This action is crucial for resolving a printer error related to the FINE cartridges for several reasons:\n\n1. **Error Resolution**: The error message on the LCD screen indicates that the FINE cartridges are not properly installed or are incompatible with the printer. Removing and reinstalling the cartridges allows the printer to re-evaluate their status and potentially resolve the error.\n\n2. **Proper Installation**: Ensuring that the FINE cartridges are securely installed is essential for the printer to function correctly. The diagram shows the correct method of installation, which involves pushing up the ink cartridge lock lever until it clicks into place. This step prevents ink leakage and ensures that the cartridges are properly seated in the printer.\n\n3. **Compatibility Check**: By removing the cartridges, the printer can verify that they are compatible with the model. If the cartridges are not compatible, the printer will not be able to print properly, and the error message will persist.\n\n4. **Maintenance**: Regularly checking and replacing FINE cartridges is important for maintaining print quality and preventing errors. The diagram provides a visual guide for proper replacement, ensuring that the printer continues to operate efficiently.\n\nIn summary, the specific action of removing and reinstalling the FINE cartridges is a critical step in resolving printer errors related to these components, ensuring proper installation, compatibility, and maintenance.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[538,531,454,110,101,104,103,532,157,461,105,462,111,147,513,528,116,524,117,274,455,102,463,176,523,407,246,512,520,129,267,275,113,2,476,529,3,100,154,530,94,484,74,527,245,541,493,148,469,542,204,501,107,519,118,465,457,508,123,84,526,392,504,540,334,472,503,93,466,525,115,165,426,92,332,96,128,161,330,481,510,514,114,124,146,163,220,227,324,344,458,536,81,86,106,109,121,149,215,280,382,518,535,55,77,182,244,511,119,219,338,447,516,517,533,78,85,277,397,402,418,467,502,515,60,82,91,172,174,231,282,329,333,366,391,401,403,415,434,439,448,459,470,507,69,228,233,341,367,405,122,351,410,33,37,42,43,50,160,191,237,240,276,398,423,443,521,539,156,158,194,320,374,384,408,437,488,509,39,97,364,378,57,65,87,189,225,226,243,247,395,177,416,480,494,4,41,442,456,537,120,175,203,218,259,386,389,390,451,66,108,188,200,201,239,293,365,383,400,435,446,452,477,63,79,162,173,235,473,40,76,89,150,153,179,328,336,350,464,309,339,359,424,75,83,183,236,294,323,436,441,490,266,368,431,440,47,112,325,353,393,413,181,283,331,346,167,184,281,375,379,394,429,44,199,234,250,343,131,132,295,326,9,64,68,342,362,444,8,46,53,127,164,358,369,433,491,505,59,67,263,303,310,419,422,438,453,468,58,80,159,166,229,356,412,460,497,522,248,354,361,414,54,70,169,187,288,411,61,62,256,432,486,7,257,380,385,399,499,178,193,298,370,372,196,271,314,345,406,136,327,450,471,45,168,273,302,311,272,284,304,337,357,186,241,306,318,474,506,534,212,255,377,125,197,258,296,297,312,315,388,500,198,253,307,316,396,260,498,48,137,348,371,5,133,185,217,232,262,363,427,482,49,130,144,180,190,213,301,340,475,56,352,376,209,221,264,387,95,143,230,238,409,483,487,142,251,254,285,373,425,11,13,51,52,134,242,299,319,347,381,489,35,38,90,135,141,265,349,420,421,36,99,138,140,252,287,6,139,192,223,270,286,291,321,322,335,355,211,10,261,292,300,445,170,210,417,98,222,428,73,289,317,449,478,479,495,496,360,206,290,485,26,71,151,155,152,195,202,214,269,27,126,268,308,16,249,492,171,208,17,12,29,313,31,14,279,24,88,305,430,34,30,32,72,25,20,23,278,224,216,404,19,205,18,145,207,21,22,1,28,15],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This is significantly lower than the capacity for standard plain paper sheets, which is approximately 50 sheets. The reduced capacity for legal-sized paper is likely due to the larger size of legal paper compared to standard paper, which may affect the printer's ability to handle the paper stack efficiently. The printer's design and paper feeding mechanism might be optimized for standard paper sizes, leading to a lower capacity for legal-sized paper. This limitation ensures that the printer can maintain proper paper feeding and prevent paper jams or misfeeds, which could occur if too many legal-sized sheets were loaded.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[212,153,513,122,456,98,211,509,210,519,400,535,79,517,2,501,121,113,117,510,75,233,280,33,83,514,87,260,4,508,154,173,262,85,229,405,231,469,76,203,205,256,408,275,93,465,218,225,281,533,82,458,502,518,78,226,406,223,286,89,198,222,235,484,221,228,285,105,209,261,263,80,467,534,81,86,245,410,174,219,220,267,77,208,507,3,252,398,463,97,237,74,129,227,271,234,239,250,325,389,466,283,324,176,461,95,253,531,189,213,323,411,183,295,92,224,240,392,468,90,204,264,359,451,5,120,247,255,382,378,522,94,102,215,251,254,532,123,454,511,8,399,9,265,266,321,521,314,515,236,270,308,416,457,464,472,88,230,284,145,147,148,197,214,372,415,506,520,96,106,185,294,375,99,315,450,101,430,536,84,137,169,379,432,258,357,512,144,206,293,377,481,91,149,351,374,488,7,125,158,168,296,471,516,268,300,384,452,34,246,346,480,35,108,320,352,407,542,119,127,175,186,390,42,100,150,172,269,273,470,25,157,192,282,303,459,504,112,347,354,424,439,473,529,538,10,27,151,232,302,61,156,194,257,292,373,6,289,449,530,38,107,309,349,478,483,36,104,135,160,259,386,436,437,55,316,429,460,17,187,200,14,65,448,114,244,291,362,383,19,110,341,248,16,56,68,181,523,32,37,73,306,370,526,528,139,438,23,39,70,272,401,446,116,162,242,287,307,363,442,28,44,62,159,188,274,342,539,30,31,40,191,290,299,317,20,297,312,343,525,537,18,141,184,15,118,318,330,397,462,494,24,131,217,360,46,171,387,447,503,67,412,455,493,524,21,22,138,195,353,403,26,497,45,111,170,180,278,279,344,395,193,319,402,440,476,541,52,199,298,332,333,12,143,310,340,366,58,109,238,326,331,348,350,165,190,313,428,29,64,103,132,146,161,496,49,140,179,277,369,51,57,367,368,385,409,426,477,482,41,115,311,418,53,72,124,130,152,336,380,394,489,126,419,444,490,540,43,63,134,329,364,479,128,339,433,66,388,47,133,288,322,396,431,498,166,182,201,334,505,13,249,337,423,48,164,177,304,391,434,1,11,136,422,196,356,365,371,167,216,417,500,54,361,71,155,163,441,243,327,335,276,393,413,202,305,435,50,59,142,345,358,355,495,474,69,376,443,486,178,60,301,338,453,207,414,420,499,527,381,328,475,491,445,425,487,241,485,421,427,492,404],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What are the potential issues you might encounter if you attempt to scan a set of 25 A4-sized documents with varying thicknesses and weights using the ADF, and how can you mitigate these issues?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[98],"raw_output":"","pred":"Scanning a set of 25 A4-sized documents with varying thicknesses and weights using the ADF can lead to several issues. The primary concern is paper jams, which can occur due to the uneven thickness and weight of the documents. This unevenness can cause the documents to misalign, leading to paper jams and potential damage to the ADF mechanism. Additionally, the varying thicknesses can affect the scanning quality, as the scanner might struggle to accurately detect and feed each document, resulting in skewed or incomplete scans.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Before scanning, ensure that all documents are of the same size and thickness. This uniformity helps in maintaining the alignment and reduces the risk of paper jams.\n\n2. **Manual Scanning**: If the documents are of significantly different thicknesses, consider scanning them manually. This method allows for more control over the feeding process, reducing the likelihood of paper jams.\n\n3. **Use of a Scanner with Advanced Feeding Mechanism**: If the ADF does not have an advanced feeding mechanism, consider using a scanner with a more robust paper handling system. This can help in handling documents of varying thicknesses more effectively.\n\n4. **Regular Maintenance**: Regularly clean the ADF and the paper feed rollers to ensure smooth operation and prevent paper jams.\n\nBy following these steps, you can minimize the potential issues and ensure a more efficient and effective scanning process.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[293,320,467,154,302,89,374,93,98,463,324,284,481,375,323,295,306,307,283,378,120,186,319,119,303,3,205,88,314,158,507,173,510,514,518,266,436,456,471,535,261,437,508,309,226,332,8,446,459,461,488,247,464,493,117,235,317,458,473,477,321,415,482,536,121,416,452,503,33,99,189,229,285,294,79,118,429,534,230,47,97,109,156,329,424,213,264,292,331,417,438,466,476,252,296,308,395,465,480,7,218,281,325,382,470,472,501,529,95,233,237,435,451,502,85,194,225,236,262,316,384,445,469,115,227,290,299,311,398,450,495,511,538,9,394,418,419,432,66,80,122,263,300,475,484,136,231,265,301,57,96,116,123,127,129,153,228,315,389,405,457,77,111,219,251,377,439,530,533,6,49,81,94,110,113,132,135,312,448,53,84,107,167,187,196,197,260,289,422,460,486,490,504,44,112,130,150,200,240,431,92,101,114,131,138,204,273,286,298,381,392,408,489,506,5,91,166,201,203,212,255,310,341,379,410,447,455,83,157,184,191,193,214,220,234,361,474,496,36,259,390,468,519,174,239,277,297,318,333,391,400,513,25,40,41,63,108,146,210,224,253,343,385,433,542,38,45,58,65,67,185,280,282,313,326,336,403,423,426,453,487,524,42,68,106,245,279,388,406,407,434,512,134,137,211,257,288,291,327,412,497,528,531,540,541,69,70,141,165,199,223,248,334,387,449,494,2,43,76,164,192,271,359,411,454,500,505,90,133,162,243,250,287,305,414,478,479,485,532,35,62,86,102,149,209,349,527,4,16,87,181,198,244,328,393,441,509,39,46,60,125,148,206,344,350,353,368,420,443,491,516,521,56,74,100,139,142,143,144,159,178,183,217,256,258,342,462,515,23,27,54,232,354,362,537,50,160,161,177,215,216,274,380,401,64,147,169,242,267,339,383,425,440,483,14,17,59,128,140,175,241,269,270,275,356,428,499,19,55,145,182,346,367,369,386,498,523,26,30,104,172,176,179,208,254,335,352,365,402,427,442,21,52,171,190,304,340,364,525,29,105,168,337,363,366,370,421,444,492,526,539,10,34,48,78,357,396,15,37,82,188,272,351,413,520,517,20,268,322,345,28,152,360,373,399,522,358,31,222,404,376,24,124,249,371,12,348,18,75,180,32,71,22,221,338,372,330,72,246,151,276,73,195,163,207,278,61,170,51,238,347,355,103,13,202,1,430,11,155,409,397,126],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This will disable the function that detects the level of ink remaining in the ink cartridge.\n   - Continue printing or copying. However, be aware that image quality may be diminished if you print or copy when there is little ink remaining in the cartridge(s).\n\n2. **Open the Printer Cover and Replace the Empty Cartridge:**\n   - Open the printer's cover.\n   - Replace each ink cartridge identified by the printer as being empty with a new, genuine Canon ink cartridge.\n   - Close the printer's cover.\n\nCanon recommends using new, genuine Canon ink cartridges for optimal image quality.

If the camera is in autofocus mode, check if the focus mode is set to continuous (AF-C) or single (AF-S) and adjust as needed.\n\n4. **Check the Focus Frame**: Ensure that the focus frame is correctly positioned on the subject. If the focus frame is not on the subject, the camera may struggle to focus.\n\n5. **Adjust the AF-Assist Illuminator**: If the camera is using the AF-assist illuminator, ensure that it is functioning correctly. If the illuminator is not working, try enabling it in the camera settings.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the focus and exposure remain locked when you press the shutter button halfway, even if the camera initially fails to focus.","source":"data/test/x100vi.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[82,176,324,125,106,395,188,59,186,102,126,98,184,228,131,135,181,392,99,177,73,90,136,312,398,397,100,191,305,325,39,133,404,123,129,190,198,194,309,144,193,364,35,128,396,108,230,107,130,368,80,142,88,127,172,326,53,66,81,96,132,393,334,67,105,111,117,156,183,77,92,97,114,138,178,408,15,38,103,121,134,196,226,281,399,139,262,268,344,36,113,192,227,401,75,89,174,279,302,321,360,58,197,214,403,65,120,162,195,253,333,30,47,76,157,158,180,343,365,112,115,258,331,110,299,362,11,13,40,43,231,269,300,155,173,270,361,406,5,33,74,84,109,310,323,349,359,18,86,118,225,241,261,287,24,45,72,83,104,171,187,275,316,351,14,17,62,68,179,244,332,54,93,140,143,170,189,199,204,274,306,352,382,391,32,70,202,276,296,327,353,402,7,64,119,203,356,363,31,69,85,116,185,283,289,339,358,369,380,400,412,413,9,57,224,373,60,91,164,182,239,254,277,290,381,42,124,34,52,122,137,147,255,20,200,210,250,291,294,303,367,229,272,282,288,347,383,388,405,21,101,273,328,372,292,313,330,16,94,175,240,246,278,390,23,51,149,163,248,260,285,298,311,350,407,37,212,243,245,314,236,259,266,280,338,394,22,165,304,345,348,95,295,307,341,357,409,12,48,161,167,232,346,201,315,27,215,284,376,385,25,154,257,2,8,141,319,389,3,6,55,208,335,377,411,415,41,159,166,205,263,354,50,56,206,217,220,221,366,375,386,4,71,146,256,342,169,219,234,247,252,267,336,374,384,19,151,49,242,320,322,145,207,216,249,340,222,286,293,10,28,378,379,153,168,251,44,61,218,235,209,271,318,46,308,416,160,223,317,211,329,387,301,233,337,1,148,150,238,26,87,63,355,29,213,418,297,410,420,265,417,414,78,419,79,152,264,370,371,237],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

Simultaneous communication: Unlike traditional text messaging, where messages are exchanged after the call ends, RTT allows you to type and send messages in real-time while the call is ongoing. This enables continuous conversation during the call.\n\n2. Simultaneous typing: Both parties can type and send messages simultaneously, unlike traditional text messaging where messages are sent sequentially.\n\n3. Immediate feedback: You can see the other person's messages as you type, allowing for immediate feedback and conversation flow.\n\n4. Call minutes: RTT uses call minutes just like a regular voice call, whereas traditional text messaging doesn't consume call time.\n\n5. No additional accessories: RTT doesn't require any additional accessories, making it more convenient to use during calls.\n\n6. Text-based communication: RTT is purely text-based, while traditional text messaging can be used for both text and voice communication.\n\n7. Accessibility: RTT is designed to be accessible for people with hearing impairments or other communication challenges, making it a valuable tool for those who need it.\n\nThese differences make RTT particularly useful for real-time communication during phone calls, especially for those who need to exchange information quickly and efficiently.","source":"data/test/moto_g_play.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[235,80,106,132,145,5,133,136,4,134,140,299,100,142,37,104,173,141,143,137,236,278,144,148,276,205,147,211,46,146,290,135,279,209,99,314,295,268,293,298,81,126,296,8,149,107,139,233,175,57,150,234,60,138,151,166,199,228,292,84,176,179,184,20,24,103,161,237,187,260,102,181,101,131,162,83,232,30,65,33,275,50,74,76,97,22,58,130,294,23,85,105,128,204,216,3,6,39,178,188,170,28,154,156,157,108,203,127,165,283,320,121,212,226,301,313,59,77,89,114,169,177,210,64,69,155,189,230,35,289,92,215,231,266,305,55,73,171,291,14,44,164,185,207,315,82,94,214,222,72,158,193,225,312,15,29,38,54,129,220,68,163,191,194,267,319,66,242,246,259,16,95,125,218,197,240,287,19,36,116,123,113,153,201,224,308,53,117,119,253,323,2,34,51,91,186,264,45,63,152,182,239,241,265,43,172,272,61,87,160,244,47,124,196,200,202,219,227,263,284,288,21,52,56,168,195,261,322,31,49,109,120,247,285,317,75,88,111,206,248,67,110,221,274,318,7,13,18,41,79,115,269,282,316,11,26,40,71,86,208,277,286,303,10,118,307,42,62,70,78,300,9,198,229,251,321,17,112,174,180,254,310,12,96,245,159,32,90,250,255,256,257,270,273,297,311,249,252,271,304,27,183,217,258,302,223,262,25,122,192,213,280,281,306,48,309,93,190,98,167,1,243,238],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

A higher resolution, such as 20M (5184 x 3888 pixels), allows for larger prints without degrading the photo quality, ensuring that details are preserved even when the image is enlarged. Conversely, a lower resolution, like VGA (640 x 480 pixels), results in smaller prints and potentially lower image quality, but it allows for more images to be stored on the memory card.

Firstly, they might prioritize the number of images they can capture during a shoot, especially when they anticipate needing to store a large number of photos, such as during a wedding or a nature expedition. Secondly, they might be using the camera in a scenario where storage space is limited, such as a backpacking trip. Lastly, a lower resolution might be sufficient for their intended use, such as sharing images on social media or for web purposes, where high resolution is not necessary.

This switch controls the operation of the vehicle's interior lights based on the status of the doors.\n\nThe door-linked interior light switch allows the driver to turn the interior lights on and off. When the doors are opened, the lights will turn on, and when the doors are closed, the lights will turn off. This feature is designed to provide illumination inside the vehicle when the doors are open, such as when loading or unloading cargo, and to conserve battery power when the doors are closed and the vehicle is parked.\n\nThe switch interacts with the vehicle's lighting system by receiving input from the door sensors, which detect when the doors are open or closed. This input is then processed by the vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU), which controls the operation of the interior lights. When the doors are open, the ECU sends a signal to turn on the interior lights, and when the doors are closed, it sends a signal to turn off the lights.\n\nThis door-linked feature helps to optimize the use of the vehicle's battery by automatically turning off the interior lights when the vehicle is parked and the doors are closed, reducing unnecessary power consumption. It also provides convenience by ensuring that the interior lights are on when needed, such as when loading or unloading cargo.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[198,219,385,91,342,345,99,313,378,153,211,248,328,578,151,210,316,369,576,72,155,206,266,285,347,411,95,156,308,3,45,199,225,246,346,381,382,388,490,577,88,102,124,166,247,318,329,334,343,416,68,83,262,267,377,398,415,15,82,162,172,212,265,338,374,375,463,506,574,203,216,294,545,566,302,344,350,20,220,257,304,307,327,368,575,25,69,96,218,281,293,320,322,341,558,37,73,89,122,136,152,215,383,384,409,86,103,112,118,127,178,228,306,335,337,348,370,379,380,397,512,7,71,100,123,232,258,259,264,269,284,301,413,85,90,126,130,137,141,208,330,340,376,407,417,509,47,79,223,229,254,277,323,355,484,542,550,573,579,13,48,76,139,272,278,291,296,326,331,402,445,580,16,18,22,44,80,106,121,168,177,204,214,253,270,282,300,336,391,485,559,17,38,94,115,116,217,224,249,357,421,435,438,454,467,519,592,97,150,163,170,268,367,462,138,154,171,226,242,261,280,315,324,333,339,466,43,93,164,207,289,351,430,472,501,549,33,41,110,119,128,240,352,373,513,546,1,92,221,390,551,273,412,432,459,491,508,111,167,286,295,297,424,428,570,10,129,173,213,237,356,372,548,74,78,134,245,371,408,440,478,539,547,84,260,311,393,395,401,446,487,534,569,14,19,145,158,159,174,239,241,319,325,544,125,222,243,263,279,504,540,583,594,24,77,227,406,414,442,453,476,571,6,9,23,132,161,292,298,434,498,572,581,98,101,107,299,389,418,455,479,582,50,58,169,312,314,387,464,468,502,505,567,593,597,70,81,117,271,392,423,450,465,470,527,560,66,244,276,288,400,433,477,496,515,543,563,589,59,67,105,231,332,403,483,503,530,64,114,188,196,349,399,404,427,480,494,541,598,57,60,87,113,140,175,192,238,305,362,394,460,499,562,32,35,46,133,230,274,287,290,317,419,62,157,309,429,52,190,363,386,422,469,536,4,42,165,252,256,452,588,595,56,131,185,303,474,510,2,26,183,354,359,436,537,21,29,53,61,104,135,176,181,194,236,255,283,321,410,492,591,189,235,251,275,361,437,486,514,528,564,49,120,184,234,521,584,144,195,202,209,522,526,533,561,27,191,310,405,471,40,193,205,358,448,481,482,489,511,28,30,36,182,201,443,447,554,149,396,493,495,552,586,497,568,596,34,51,63,143,179,187,500,31,54,441,451,146,186,439,456,461,535,587,590,65,200,538,585,39,109,366,473,553,250,353,360,233,12,148,420,475,488,523,525,11,55,147,507,108,142,160,75,449,458,520,425,529,180,197,365,457,518,557,431,517,555,556,565,8,426,532,5,531,364,444,516,524],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

This action is crucial for safety because the PDA system is designed to assist the driver in maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles and to prevent the vehicle from approaching too closely to a detectable object. Over-reliance on the PDA system can lead to complacency, as the driver might assume that the system will handle all necessary braking and steering operations. However, the system's assistance is limited, and the driver must still perform regular braking and steering operations as needed. Ignoring the instructions displayed on the multi-information display could result in the driver failing to react to sudden changes in traffic conditions, potentially leading to accidents. Therefore, following the instructions ensures that the driver remains vigilant and prepared to take control of the vehicle when necessary, thereby maintaining safety on the road.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[482,271,306,95,581,313,347,492,69,78,318,350,236,3,91,177,77,483,45,70,576,381,477,490,491,89,335,523,280,486,323,245,484,72,97,213,214,283,353,46,61,110,266,294,488,275,481,571,105,305,378,480,487,73,217,302,315,580,36,98,133,211,282,416,567,56,82,101,212,216,345,355,457,79,182,246,278,393,103,265,268,312,316,328,512,87,247,258,276,334,376,412,485,12,115,152,210,259,277,352,456,57,156,163,166,169,201,248,267,351,375,377,391,402,479,570,342,359,372,382,398,478,515,546,41,131,150,165,222,262,304,338,369,405,413,445,450,35,76,81,192,203,256,257,288,311,324,373,374,2,33,48,99,119,157,231,289,291,319,449,471,502,13,90,106,116,188,204,232,281,295,329,380,442,504,572,28,43,49,68,135,137,208,235,395,411,414,452,454,18,34,51,93,94,136,160,179,180,243,260,261,263,269,298,300,356,443,472,495,560,577,29,42,67,74,141,205,209,218,237,244,284,285,308,399,403,417,436,461,575,579,47,139,207,221,272,336,341,370,409,474,514,30,59,117,215,220,249,292,301,309,339,340,421,447,467,500,513,549,569,573,31,132,138,239,264,299,360,408,432,438,453,507,566,19,60,80,111,142,171,227,228,349,396,462,473,498,578,120,151,175,202,206,270,365,390,401,406,440,441,464,476,503,508,510,545,548,559,1,4,16,85,134,161,184,273,314,363,433,543,50,118,174,181,185,191,193,293,297,337,348,357,364,460,475,493,511,27,64,178,186,307,325,333,400,410,424,458,489,497,506,527,561,52,58,63,65,84,104,126,190,198,230,238,255,303,358,362,379,427,437,439,446,451,496,501,505,557,102,121,199,223,330,343,346,392,526,539,574,10,37,71,112,145,233,371,509,538,541,542,568,21,32,38,62,168,183,197,241,252,287,332,387,420,422,428,459,465,547,564,585,7,39,159,279,320,322,368,404,444,469,470,583,22,123,125,127,170,189,194,225,226,234,317,327,388,425,448,592,15,86,88,162,173,229,251,326,544,44,53,92,114,124,148,153,172,494,587,40,155,164,219,310,426,594,55,144,176,250,331,354,385,499,521,20,274,361,455,466,11,66,130,253,254,286,407,430,435,558,590,598,14,113,140,147,195,468,530,556,595,415,423,529,586,6,83,200,224,296,367,386,397,431,563,96,290,344,383,109,129,240,242,321,419,528,551,552,154,75,122,434,531,532,8,17,524,429,522,562,146,537,540,588,149,196,596,128,550,25,158,463,536,9,100,589,167,107,389,534,519,591,593,187,366,520,384,516,565,5,525,535,394,518,584,24,54,143,582,23,517,555,553,597,533,26,418,554,108],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the Brake Override System, and how might it affect the driver's experience when activated?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[180],"raw_output":"","pred":"The Brake Override System serves an important safety function in the vehicle. Its purpose is to prevent sudden acceleration when the accelerator and brake pedals are depressed simultaneously. This can happen accidentally, especially in emergency situations where the driver might apply the brakes while trying to avoid a collision.\n\nWhen the Brake Override System is activated, it restricts the engine's output, essentially \"overriding\" the accelerator pedal's input. This prevents the vehicle from accelerating uncontrollably, even if the driver is trying to brake hard.\n\nThe system is designed to be noticeable to the driver, as it will illuminate a warning message on the multi-information display. This serves as a reminder that the system is active and preventing acceleration.\n\nThe effect on the driver's experience is that they may notice a slight reduction in vehicle speed when the system is engaged. However, this is a temporary measure to prevent dangerous situations. The driver should still be able to maintain control of the vehicle and apply the brakes as needed.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Brake Override System is designed to be a temporary measure, not a permanent solution. The driver should still be able to accelerate normally when the system is not active. The system is intended to be a safety feature that kicks in only when necessary to prevent accidents.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[180,479,581,580,217,184,79,216,502,311,354,214,342,477,192,241,288,309,245,301,266,486,296,346,484,77,78,307,356,273,571,578,38,181,353,3,268,341,359,471,177,215,339,494,340,357,355,492,235,263,324,344,347,567,570,276,485,487,271,361,365,569,22,283,338,209,308,7,137,246,267,299,304,445,495,501,185,257,490,527,579,4,183,259,446,572,213,222,248,249,275,165,200,205,208,350,16,219,220,250,252,282,298,303,316,358,428,236,280,318,345,491,576,204,274,310,312,325,348,116,182,191,195,260,277,328,349,515,548,469,493,27,127,134,203,242,258,272,331,336,337,343,371,507,543,573,592,89,130,194,207,278,289,300,432,464,2,10,46,90,129,133,333,370,476,483,506,510,74,87,94,178,193,313,422,73,132,179,186,232,234,262,323,332,441,478,546,68,119,211,247,319,430,473,503,562,218,221,240,256,321,351,420,542,547,563,70,155,253,281,317,326,41,61,95,139,198,251,265,290,305,363,375,421,544,91,118,128,166,168,254,284,285,287,302,334,335,429,440,447,456,497,552,566,590,111,136,223,297,314,577,6,30,56,60,72,105,117,125,199,202,233,243,292,294,369,451,574,12,57,101,126,131,142,210,229,293,315,352,373,374,392,452,482,545,575,92,98,110,201,322,403,509,1,69,82,93,103,123,138,279,291,306,320,330,360,404,438,439,449,453,458,475,480,489,40,45,122,140,151,158,170,244,255,368,372,405,472,504,523,549,551,102,149,156,163,176,226,327,378,481,550,33,49,65,71,96,164,169,174,230,239,329,381,402,457,462,531,8,14,44,52,76,100,135,153,172,380,382,408,426,450,536,564,591,21,115,152,171,383,436,474,512,561,47,48,51,59,86,109,196,206,269,286,385,391,397,406,427,460,513,19,36,97,112,121,124,159,162,270,412,431,522,538,55,106,120,188,225,261,470,526,532,80,81,264,362,364,514,9,104,114,411,560,589,20,32,42,43,99,161,175,238,377,212,387,433,468,541,582,584,11,25,50,228,367,444,454,508,540,596,35,83,295,379,401,467,511,594,85,150,366,376,400,409,415,419,448,37,67,173,231,384,395,424,5,18,31,58,84,160,463,520,197,237,398,399,435,559,593,598,62,141,190,227,407,443,535,28,29,63,64,167,388,521,583,587,15,154,413,437,461,539,556,66,386,390,416,496,500,517,537,39,144,148,224,423,459,524,558,53,189,505,519,534,107,113,145,414,498,143,417,425,442,455,88,393,396,530,24,23,389,488,147,13,466,157,553,518,410,418,465,34,533,499,557,595,75,187,108,434,525,586,529,568,555,588,597,528,146,394,565,585,26,54,554,516,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This switch allows the driver to adjust the angle of the front part of the seat cushion. By raising or lowering the front part of the seat cushion, the driver can achieve a more ergonomic seating position, which can reduce strain on the back and improve overall comfort during long drives. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining proper posture and reducing the risk of back pain or discomfort.\n\nPosition (2) is the seat height control switch. This switch enables the driver to adjust the height of the seat. By raising or lowering the seat, the driver can ensure that their feet are flat on the floor and their knees are at a 90-degree angle when the seat is in the upright position. This adjustment is essential for maintaining proper leg position, which can prevent fatigue and improve overall driving comfort. Additionally, it helps in achieving a safer driving posture, which is important for quick and effective response to road conditions.\n\nTogether, these adjustments contribute significantly to the overall comfort and safety of the vehicle's seating system by allowing the driver to customize the seat to their specific needs and preferences, thereby reducing the risk of discomfort and potential accidents.","source":"data/test/elantra_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[28,16,156,194,27,70,111,183,97,172,17,32,185,205,155,218,176,217,196,142,161,193,204,23,153,346,352,345,34,36,42,114,175,200,38,234,240,267,332,529,168,187,198,210,56,160,189,216,206,497,158,186,54,159,197,525,120,150,181,348,367,164,354,74,118,61,119,208,221,531,24,68,188,211,230,258,40,173,266,315,530,102,149,174,201,202,209,271,310,477,527,64,190,227,269,284,356,378,52,77,95,106,115,152,224,236,250,5,35,60,62,199,212,215,456,58,75,347,92,184,353,366,369,414,533,30,39,117,170,178,225,425,57,123,157,165,229,243,350,381,104,128,144,151,154,177,195,342,372,382,415,454,482,78,331,377,419,485,33,113,171,220,392,473,475,65,90,141,237,304,351,421,453,528,26,66,139,148,244,302,344,349,355,484,22,72,91,112,130,256,450,476,478,481,495,50,124,146,163,213,226,299,334,363,373,479,67,88,99,259,336,362,364,408,480,98,126,138,182,203,223,238,254,328,374,458,489,19,89,147,162,169,262,474,513,14,18,49,73,76,80,265,321,368,384,85,101,145,192,228,314,361,435,41,82,233,290,300,301,324,340,397,432,455,48,143,166,207,231,251,295,296,322,426,8,125,179,235,263,357,365,387,444,498,25,63,71,127,136,140,264,286,305,359,386,393,401,524,59,69,83,103,287,303,312,316,326,335,391,406,410,459,532,15,100,110,252,261,289,306,380,396,411,436,447,55,84,122,134,247,255,285,318,333,338,339,390,465,483,94,129,222,241,248,358,385,420,429,449,457,512,13,44,107,260,272,288,398,409,413,441,509,31,46,180,246,388,389,400,29,87,135,330,431,488,191,242,275,294,308,319,412,51,132,214,253,276,327,343,405,422,446,79,283,291,298,320,416,486,47,292,311,323,394,445,494,506,526,105,376,448,500,86,121,133,281,313,370,427,510,11,219,239,245,249,417,430,21,43,45,137,325,375,379,399,460,503,131,257,383,404,451,496,37,297,402,418,491,499,167,232,279,307,317,452,487,507,93,360,439,2,20,53,268,309,341,403,442,463,490,293,329,407,423,7,81,270,278,424,468,492,519,10,108,443,511,517,4,508,109,514,371,395,469,471,493,433,472,274,337,461,3,96,273,462,470,280,434,501,515,277,437,464,520,440,438,1,505,523,6,504,12,116,282,428,502,516,522,467,466,521,518,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The system may display this as a reminder to check the tire pressure soon.\n\nHowever, if the tire pressure is consistently low or if the warning light is accompanied by a \"Immediately Check Tire when Safe\" message, this suggests a more serious issue.  The system may be unable to detect sudden tire ruptures, so if the tire pressure drops rapidly, it's crucial to inspect the tire immediately.  Always consult the owner's manual for specific tire pressure recommendations and the tire pressure warning system's instructions.\n","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[397,564,4,396,381,547,84,404,519,406,499,330,367,436,542,106,378,398,545,546,400,401,441,407,561,213,538,99,306,403,328,409,402,16,442,491,440,408,464,405,490,394,544,295,465,327,325,11,447,466,495,496,386,370,390,248,389,171,309,479,395,500,35,255,310,368,388,534,83,170,172,187,195,399,411,457,463,169,225,462,222,296,416,503,82,207,297,459,27,29,181,219,284,533,280,318,369,387,460,535,73,224,235,324,372,423,425,74,111,215,244,376,458,37,194,257,266,315,469,477,478,53,95,168,232,391,426,439,481,57,68,138,430,433,467,502,28,40,223,231,251,271,317,349,358,371,375,414,429,476,498,543,38,101,139,199,212,254,279,285,374,417,432,470,475,20,30,54,77,85,148,179,259,273,316,319,322,323,347,385,392,424,461,523,532,32,72,180,229,239,242,260,265,289,339,346,350,453,480,525,537,13,36,39,47,176,189,218,236,240,252,294,321,415,472,504,1,10,26,89,94,110,116,121,238,278,281,303,340,422,428,431,445,450,456,488,489,528,122,152,185,216,217,299,304,314,337,380,384,487,497,145,188,214,220,230,233,253,264,270,275,302,382,443,452,474,501,5,12,58,62,78,79,86,140,177,205,221,234,283,305,326,329,335,344,345,359,383,446,471,526,527,536,65,69,76,156,192,312,419,435,468,473,31,33,42,109,115,124,165,182,228,261,393,410,454,540,14,43,88,98,127,175,184,206,313,336,351,362,413,421,434,483,48,52,55,56,75,91,102,117,125,143,155,193,237,245,258,269,274,287,377,412,438,449,451,455,494,514,50,61,92,96,137,146,158,198,202,204,267,288,291,311,357,366,437,517,531,18,113,131,151,290,355,373,484,3,9,49,60,93,150,167,186,200,208,243,277,286,307,342,482,46,105,130,134,149,157,173,292,293,360,448,516,539,19,51,66,71,100,128,129,141,178,190,197,203,209,210,256,352,356,493,126,132,133,135,183,191,227,262,276,282,308,515,554,59,103,120,136,226,241,247,300,363,506,513,15,21,64,107,154,211,250,332,334,348,420,444,550,559,7,112,144,320,508,2,8,63,87,174,201,379,529,553,563,17,272,298,548,364,427,22,44,246,249,45,142,343,361,418,485,25,114,163,560,509,268,365,562,108,123,333,512,41,67,331,486,301,338,551,552,6,34,354,521,522,97,104,263,557,518,556,90,196,147,153,558,492,555,81,161,159,341,507,23,353,530,541,70,80,524,119,162,510,511,24,166,505,118,160,520,549,164],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the information in the target tables:\n\nWhat is the relationship between the Alert timing and Alert options settings for the Lane Departure Alert system, and how might changing one affect the effectiveness of the other?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[513],"raw_output":"","pred":"The Alert timing and Alert options settings for the Lane Departure Alert system are related in that they both affect how the system communicates to the driver that a lane departure is occurring. \n\nThe Alert timing setting determines when the alert will be activated - whether it's later, default, or earlier than the standard timing. This allows the driver to customize how soon they are notified of a lane departure.\n\nThe Alert options setting determines what type of alert will be given - whether it's a vibration or audible sound. This allows the driver to choose their preferred method of notification.\n\nChanging one setting can affect the effectiveness of the other. For example, if the Alert timing is set to \"Earlier\" but the Alert options are set to \"Vibration\", the driver may not hear the vibration alert and may not notice the lane departure as quickly. Conversely, if the Alert timing is set to \"Later\" but the Alert options are set to \"Audible\", the driver may not hear the alert at all and may not notice the lane departure.\n\nThe ideal combination would be to set the Alert timing to \"Default\" or \"Earlier\" and the Alert options to \"Audible\" to provide both visual and auditory warnings. This would give the driver the best chance of noticing the lane departure and taking corrective action if needed.","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[513,453,437,438,546,452,515,541,547,3,245,246,113,247,450,95,213,449,165,465,514,243,250,104,241,287,102,451,510,509,516,242,99,249,511,517,223,235,434,126,237,302,282,512,533,227,240,535,199,433,435,508,543,78,112,148,2,266,269,280,44,85,133,228,229,232,244,270,186,233,540,45,275,325,354,444,13,319,38,84,129,222,225,226,238,251,264,376,545,122,252,279,127,236,321,518,537,137,200,432,455,507,63,94,239,298,82,253,470,20,64,132,171,218,221,442,446,525,527,529,101,193,281,288,120,277,313,403,4,7,96,134,169,265,267,276,300,306,309,328,466,506,561,12,25,69,188,284,297,332,339,436,439,445,454,462,14,83,103,144,212,268,542,75,105,170,189,248,255,259,283,294,333,336,388,395,396,405,441,28,39,49,89,136,154,172,317,324,329,377,8,35,66,79,86,108,150,258,274,289,295,310,352,375,409,430,459,532,539,70,73,87,128,185,234,254,290,308,355,369,394,440,48,135,182,230,260,316,323,334,360,361,381,408,424,474,489,497,526,17,201,257,278,299,307,311,318,378,423,472,499,544,65,74,88,93,100,110,111,125,138,220,291,296,322,326,347,372,448,460,92,168,177,271,285,304,327,350,481,538,117,131,175,180,335,353,363,416,419,425,476,504,536,41,192,197,198,224,256,315,330,358,365,387,397,467,502,31,40,43,109,155,167,216,231,303,312,357,386,399,429,491,528,559,16,32,115,140,146,156,176,261,272,305,338,398,407,413,427,503,523,553,26,47,50,53,72,106,130,149,152,158,173,183,195,202,204,217,359,401,428,457,463,475,563,19,27,58,60,91,98,116,190,203,262,373,389,406,414,417,426,519,522,550,18,42,52,97,119,151,187,191,340,342,370,391,400,402,411,447,486,552,36,68,107,141,163,181,196,292,346,356,362,380,390,494,10,30,145,194,293,337,344,366,469,480,492,1,29,33,62,139,166,208,301,331,443,484,34,80,124,157,162,184,205,207,214,215,219,286,320,345,371,404,412,415,477,479,209,351,367,374,478,488,493,560,6,54,57,121,206,422,456,500,9,21,76,77,161,179,273,314,384,392,490,501,548,11,123,210,364,461,473,483,51,263,393,487,564,37,61,382,81,159,341,418,468,498,505,551,557,558,143,147,343,349,5,15,153,178,555,368,495,524,554,55,59,90,142,383,410,431,464,348,160,496,67,211,556,56,114,562,22,385,485,23,164,520,71,379,458,420,174,534,521,118,421,531,471,46,482,530,24,549],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The \"ON/OFF\" button is essential for initiating the climate control system, while the \"Heat\" button is crucial for managing the warmth within the vehicle.","source":"data/test/silverado_ev_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,368,175,365,327,15,113,108,110,7,5,329,102,104,282,316,374,53,366,373,281,8,143,83,328,135,178,180,248,347,395,106,339,31,367,377,43,49,26,28,307,41,194,55,212,334,409,24,40,90,337,68,150,256,370,425,58,98,201,214,323,6,79,371,51,99,199,32,290,312,206,343,103,203,21,38,46,249,378,17,35,85,88,262,100,287,344,364,25,80,10,219,234,294,369,44,87,111,128,317,342,95,145,216,45,115,158,167,263,340,348,54,247,255,36,84,127,215,278,138,139,149,277,33,125,265,298,303,397,414,27,92,280,345,12,50,91,112,155,332,422,18,120,283,22,65,118,144,179,220,421,47,57,177,372,131,141,146,184,301,336,93,119,121,124,335,341,11,39,52,71,81,116,142,250,324,405,23,42,86,109,140,231,295,375,62,105,122,239,289,419,123,185,232,353,355,59,94,208,210,245,415,426,101,126,181,209,417,37,48,130,195,205,259,306,385,406,411,34,133,163,170,233,304,387,413,114,241,266,305,330,357,400,9,117,148,191,196,235,267,308,351,379,403,410,412,2,60,129,420,424,66,89,132,136,168,253,423,56,197,204,217,221,225,269,97,19,153,157,160,228,242,297,331,401,69,134,202,207,243,314,320,63,193,237,322,404,4,30,165,172,200,226,227,257,261,285,310,325,338,427,147,189,213,273,73,137,164,223,293,319,321,326,333,67,198,229,270,318,363,383,161,166,29,151,156,183,428,1,13,70,275,381,218,251,407,162,211,315,408,418,96,224,246,352,14,292,313,380,3,74,182,258,393,75,107,302,356,360,187,291,309,399,260,386,391,64,76,82,284,311,72,376,388,20,192,244,268,358,359,16,252,299,169,349,354,61,271,346,350,429,154,159,238,272,296,279,390,402,276,188,254,264,190,236,300,384,152,173,398,77,186,362,389,392,240,361,416,382,396,171,286,274,288,174,222,230,78,394],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What are the potential consequences of adding electrical equipment to a vehicle with an integrated OnStar system, and how might this impact the vehicle's functionality and user experience?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[413],"raw_output":"","pred":"Adding electrical equipment to a vehicle with an integrated OnStar system can have several potential consequences. Firstly, the equipment may interfere with the OnStar system's operation, leading to malfunctions or complete failure of the system. This could result in the loss of critical safety features such as emergency services, remote vehicle diagnostics, and vehicle location tracking, which are essential for both the driver and passengers' safety and convenience.\n\nSecondly, the added electrical equipment may drain the vehicle's 12-volt battery, even when the vehicle is not in operation. This can lead to a discharged battery, which may require a jump start and could potentially damage the vehicle's electrical system.\n\nAdditionally, the OnStar system is integrated into the vehicle's electrical architecture. Adding external devices can create a complex electrical environment that may not be compatible with the vehicle's existing systems, leading to potential conflicts and operational issues.\n\nOverall, these consequences can significantly impact the vehicle's functionality and user experience, potentially compromising safety and convenience. It is crucial to consult with the dealership or authorized service provider before adding any electrical equipment to ensure compatibility and avoid these issues.","source":"data/test/silverado_ev_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[413,322,408,417,245,412,420,10,409,411,415,423,154,425,391,414,325,69,410,419,173,237,19,242,155,184,105,172,401,100,360,429,101,416,124,183,397,102,207,332,182,252,272,179,197,210,20,274,159,171,321,31,67,187,205,212,236,379,42,54,161,229,260,265,311,326,65,103,185,307,319,333,338,68,70,93,160,198,277,293,296,310,2,53,141,150,157,211,281,405,137,287,295,313,335,352,200,146,168,218,294,306,324,334,407,181,186,233,271,275,312,35,37,66,163,167,225,331,336,374,376,381,422,12,15,16,50,76,104,114,148,153,228,258,269,273,359,427,22,97,99,120,131,156,165,170,280,346,368,418,57,63,94,144,189,190,216,262,9,40,59,135,214,267,399,402,4,6,8,23,108,152,178,243,256,261,354,380,387,132,134,149,169,180,193,247,254,279,323,5,13,24,33,64,118,164,199,223,238,249,289,292,337,367,421,115,133,145,151,166,204,246,320,364,365,377,426,7,44,58,89,106,162,175,191,270,284,288,316,339,342,362,363,378,424,11,129,202,208,253,308,350,369,41,48,91,121,122,123,136,188,302,315,231,250,251,314,403,128,138,177,201,206,213,219,263,264,282,305,309,356,384,406,158,192,291,297,299,351,382,86,92,116,126,143,209,234,239,266,268,383,21,49,60,61,95,98,107,109,117,127,235,290,327,400,30,39,75,110,176,255,345,386,388,390,14,112,147,194,278,298,344,366,18,72,142,174,195,222,224,226,259,276,340,358,385,392,3,119,203,227,248,283,329,370,428,43,111,343,347,389,17,36,47,77,241,330,29,96,113,232,404,34,81,285,304,398,25,46,51,85,130,139,301,372,32,38,221,230,244,257,341,375,52,87,361,196,215,318,349,62,125,286,355,373,82,217,300,353,74,220,317,45,55,328,28,371,26,73,240,303,1,84,71,393,357,88,79,27,140,56,83,395,396,80,78,90,348,394],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What is the potential impact on system sounds and voice recognition when audio is being output from an eARC supported device while watching content from an HDMI input?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[74],"raw_output":"","pred":"When audio is output from an eARC supported device while watching content from an HDMI input, the TV's system sounds and audio responses are not output. This means that any system notifications, such as volume changes or input source switches, will not be heard through the TV speakers. Additionally, the voice recognition performance of the TV's built-in microphone may degrade. This degradation is specific to TVs equipped with a built-in microphone, and it can affect the accuracy and responsiveness of voice commands and voice-based interactions. The impact on voice recognition is likely to be more pronounced when the TV is actively processing voice commands or when the built-in microphone is being used for other purposes, such as voice-activated features or voice-activated assistants. Overall, this configuration can lead to a more immersive audio experience by passing the audio directly to the eARC supported device, but it may reduce the reliability of the TV's built-in voice recognition system.","source":"data/test/bravia_xr_a95l.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[74,125,43,71,75,123,10,77,9,63,73,124,72,44,122,5,82,70,76,87,81,2,126,78,108,41,93,42,68,89,86,3,79,24,64,67,23,80,40,47,83,140,62,102,143,88,91,92,11,14,90,135,17,8,84,4,22,15,16,45,66,19,105,111,25,46,120,115,117,7,69,101,136,137,116,128,142,1,18,107,127,32,27,121,99,100,112,20,97,113,37,49,50,85,130,144,29,36,53,35,139,147,39,94,33,55,118,6,65,138,12,48,57,109,132,13,38,51,131,30,34,61,134,21,110,129,103,114,133,26,56,58,141,145,59,98,54,106,104,28,95,31,60,96,119,52,146],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This connection is typically faster and more advanced than LTE, offering higher data speeds and lower latency, but it may not have the fallback capability to switch to LTE if 5G is not available.\n\nIn summary, the icon for the LTE network connected in an LTE network that includes 5G represents a more flexible and potentially faster network connection, while the standard 5G network connection icon indicates a dedicated 5G network connection with potentially higher speeds and capabilities.","source":"data/test/sms921w.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[32,177,138,31,139,207,18,43,133,17,160,132,33,54,134,90,170,20,100,99,137,14,85,123,51,60,102,127,129,45,121,125,130,8,11,68,120,194,39,47,89,203,114,167,3,41,105,131,175,6,10,34,44,95,140,163,166,218,57,72,77,201,112,116,117,126,135,23,27,36,40,46,87,104,136,15,21,48,50,107,141,64,111,157,165,180,217,42,211,25,53,65,70,78,176,61,86,96,124,144,216,35,37,38,59,81,84,122,161,205,55,149,195,94,110,148,155,190,24,67,101,113,151,154,58,66,75,168,182,56,106,118,29,76,82,88,98,109,169,187,49,52,92,128,2,7,30,79,91,150,159,74,215,219,63,145,196,9,12,28,153,181,189,13,80,108,147,191,73,97,152,93,192,19,164,178,5,119,158,173,26,83,103,197,198,71,156,188,62,69,142,200,214,208,199,185,16,172,179,146,22,162,115,210,193,202,186,209,213,183,143,206,171,204,174,212,1,184,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"What is the relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of the lens described in the document, and how does this relationship affect the depth of field and exposure in photography?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[410],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of the lens described in the document is inversely proportional. As the focal length increases, the maximum aperture decreases, and vice versa. For example, the lens has a maximum aperture of f/3.5 at 18 mm focal length and f/5.6 at 55 mm focal length. This relationship affects the depth of field and exposure in photography in several ways:\n\n1. **Depth of Field**: A longer focal length (e.g., 55 mm) results in a shallower depth of field compared to a shorter focal length (e.g., 18 mm). This means that with a longer focal length, the subject will be in sharp focus while the foreground and background will be more blurred. Conversely, a shorter focal length will result in a deeper depth of field, keeping more of the scene in sharp focus.\n\n2. **Exposure**: The maximum aperture also affects exposure. A larger aperture (e.g., f/3.5) allows more light to enter the lens, which can be useful in low-light conditions to avoid underexposure. However, a smaller aperture (e.g., f/5.6) reduces the amount of light entering the lens, which can be beneficial in controlling the depth of field or reducing lens flare.\n\nIn summary, the focal length and maximum aperture of the lens work together to control the depth of field and exposure, allowing photographers to achieve the desired effect in their images.","source":"data/test/d5600.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[400,405,410,379,292,340,220,148,75,218,332,264,338,402,401,412,418,122,395,383,336,257,334,406,382,165,259,179,276,294,146,144,331,43,147,151,190,149,150,367,370,414,333,145,143,112,419,8,86,118,377,47,131,7,102,110,120,180,282,129,261,345,346,375,384,385,44,119,403,31,106,154,293,78,85,121,33,113,142,254,265,280,371,420,76,116,132,152,155,81,114,156,11,28,37,58,67,98,398,32,157,387,407,408,199,56,79,90,105,108,153,192,260,263,99,178,341,5,342,348,364,46,168,397,36,45,123,256,275,74,80,109,159,250,277,318,368,396,415,94,96,197,201,16,196,314,344,347,361,378,404,416,38,111,267,337,343,411,103,194,200,335,366,409,115,140,160,211,93,95,130,284,315,399,73,101,135,138,198,417,421,39,48,104,133,245,274,386,57,164,177,273,339,413,423,117,127,258,369,422,50,53,210,317,322,359,128,163,176,187,281,296,312,3,193,195,14,35,82,107,205,306,89,252,319,321,91,217,223,262,272,358,17,92,97,136,158,191,212,249,268,354,77,87,181,204,214,222,290,303,308,309,29,241,255,13,41,124,137,184,186,216,219,248,307,311,313,365,9,172,173,269,30,84,166,167,185,251,253,278,286,125,202,372,6,10,12,62,63,134,139,175,236,362,169,215,230,232,323,324,27,49,141,213,72,203,231,234,289,391,240,171,209,228,287,360,388,126,162,183,208,226,229,247,320,349,363,100,170,174,207,246,283,291,351,23,64,88,161,224,242,244,295,305,356,357,2,34,54,83,225,310,353,373,298,424,21,270,235,59,239,52,206,266,376,389,24,61,352,271,325,279,380,300,182,25,299,238,393,20,55,68,71,288,390,22,1,65,233,237,392,70,316,69,304,227,302,355,51,66,330,381,328,350,4,301,42,40,221,243,297,15,189,19,60,374,327,394,18,326,285,26,329,188],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

If they are not, repeat the height adjustment process using the height lever.\n\n3. **Adjust the Height Lever**: If the doors are not aligned, turn the height lever (A) towards \"UP\" to raise the right-side door or towards \"DOWN\" to lower it, depending on the initial adjustment.\n\n4. **Verify the Alignment**: After adjusting, open the right-side door of the freezer with both fridge doors closed again to ensure the doors are properly aligned at the top.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the height lever remains effective and the doors are properly aligned, even after adding heavy items to the door bins.","source":"data/test/rf59c7_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[46,47,142,143,48,240,144,333,45,242,39,134,332,72,141,265,33,139,12,16,56,181,241,335,38,151,152,21,62,135,18,271,334,77,232,237,15,64,122,343,71,132,168,103,116,145,199,133,364,11,32,110,9,17,173,175,213,233,23,164,166,170,174,234,239,249,272,336,42,128,148,273,114,118,188,214,274,24,65,102,162,180,22,112,137,358,371,372,5,158,163,178,202,221,243,317,337,19,36,43,105,109,216,230,235,263,275,279,325,342,366,49,51,100,111,117,127,177,182,250,294,351,359,20,147,167,193,225,357,55,84,146,267,278,286,323,328,331,347,367,31,78,85,136,155,157,169,226,269,298,307,308,345,348,352,73,97,215,227,261,297,313,353,40,41,82,98,107,156,160,244,255,256,268,280,339,370,30,37,126,176,208,245,14,26,34,104,161,171,246,254,262,277,338,61,121,198,203,251,318,330,354,360,368,69,88,113,165,192,196,211,289,299,302,362,369,108,172,231,292,295,314,326,10,94,106,123,209,224,238,258,281,301,303,375,52,80,129,140,149,154,207,260,329,346,25,75,86,101,125,130,153,190,210,236,264,296,320,365,44,79,184,248,276,356,74,150,197,247,300,312,319,324,7,8,13,50,53,60,67,115,200,201,218,361,179,259,266,340,344,349,355,59,66,219,220,288,304,305,321,120,159,194,350,363,68,119,222,252,293,311,138,257,57,63,76,131,204,206,223,282,341,373,309,327,4,70,96,217,315,380,310,87,95,183,253,306,316,54,99,212,2,3,205,287,83,270,290,58,81,93,228,284,379,6,229,27,291,191,91,124,195,374,378,90,285,377,29,1,186,322,92,187,28,189,35,376,89,185,283],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Explain how using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator can help minimize energy consumption, ensuring to reference the underlying physics.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[9],"raw_output":"","pred":"Using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator minimizes energy consumption by leveraging the latent heat of fusion.  When frozen food is placed in the refrigerator, it absorbs heat from the surrounding air, causing the ice to melt. This process requires energy, but it's a more efficient use of energy than running the refrigerator at a higher temperature to thaw the food.  Essentially, the refrigerator is doing less work to maintain a lower temperature because it's using the food itself to generate heat.  This reduces the overall energy consumption of the refrigerator, making it more efficient.\n","source":"data/test/rf59c7_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[9,26,20,55,102,294,181,372,151,347,85,340,156,313,21,103,342,5,182,279,60,122,199,157,198,221,295,371,278,64,66,86,87,116,118,183,280,307,319,115,213,351,360,149,256,290,303,180,249,306,309,194,171,302,373,308,113,146,158,262,339,100,108,128,168,220,314,61,209,311,323,335,350,374,10,79,117,120,144,152,169,226,247,301,353,18,32,98,119,244,268,281,288,349,369,77,84,111,174,193,364,132,214,254,269,289,7,163,190,338,343,53,105,179,16,24,62,73,106,110,112,164,195,277,298,23,52,178,261,282,304,354,368,121,173,175,205,215,259,1,292,310,348,114,137,230,291,19,78,172,208,266,274,296,67,93,324,97,142,267,286,346,359,81,109,123,250,6,82,207,216,276,358,17,22,25,94,125,147,155,161,162,176,299,4,68,101,154,203,219,240,293,297,355,189,202,258,328,332,366,96,223,271,327,367,253,265,285,56,104,196,317,8,107,136,148,160,234,242,83,88,184,197,365,11,14,15,80,210,237,352,300,312,75,170,201,245,275,363,177,257,273,12,59,153,167,200,333,375,99,159,217,218,263,362,235,305,357,63,134,231,255,272,13,57,133,330,370,336,337,246,58,143,270,356,141,252,260,264,316,29,46,145,211,212,251,206,320,334,2,48,72,232,248,331,344,41,222,239,37,65,225,315,50,241,38,51,76,129,139,227,228,318,47,165,40,166,345,192,45,243,321,127,204,74,150,233,36,71,30,329,28,126,130,361,33,43,34,49,325,224,31,238,229,124,138,341,27,326,69,188,380,236,140,191,70,42,284,287,95,135,39,54,3,44,35,376,92,131,322,89,283,185,90,377,91,379,187,378,186],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This information is crucial for understanding network compatibility and user experience in different geographical locations.\n\n1. **Network Compatibility**: The device supports multiple frequency bands, including GSM900, GSM1800, WCDMA900/2100, LTE, and 5G NR. This broad spectrum of bands ensures that the device can connect to various mobile networks globally. However, the specific bands supported in different regions may vary, affecting network availability and performance. For instance, 5G NR bands (n1/n3/n7/n8/n20/n28/n38/n40/n77) and n41/n78 are restricted to indoor use in several countries, which could limit outdoor connectivity in those areas.\n\n2. **User Experience**: The power limits for different frequency bands (e.g., 20dBm for Bluetooth 2.4GHz and Wi-Fi 2.4GHz, 23dBm for Wi-Fi 5G in specific bands) indicate the maximum transmit power allowed. Higher transmit power can enhance signal strength and range, improving connectivity and data transfer speeds. However, excessive power can lead to interference with other devices and networks, potentially degrading user experience.\n\n3. **Geographical Restrictions**: The restrictions in the 5 GHz band in various countries (e.g., 5150-5350 MHz for indoor use) highlight the importance of adhering to local regulations. Non-compliance can lead to legal issues and network disruptions.\n\nIn summary, the device's broad frequency band support ensures global network compatibility, but the specific bands and power limits in different regions impact network availability and user experience, necessitating careful consideration of local regulations and network conditions.","source":"data/test/200.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[9,210,97,173,88,120,195,52,159,19,28,111,128,187,152,37,44,61,81,202,67,136,36,45,53,74,104,144,167,180,60,129,204,151,163,27,211,158,18,139,5,23,107,87,141,209,121,143,56,66,142,157,72,8,113,69,135,155,161,164,25,58,71,149,3,115,119,156,6,150,166,170,206,108,147,199,201,46,48,106,33,57,102,109,198,200,40,73,83,146,79,84,96,110,70,80,90,13,14,32,148,154,172,194,41,54,78,112,35,59,76,4,64,127,191,192,208,7,26,43,75,188,197,49,85,99,140,186,207,15,95,116,145,196,17,101,160,203,1,93,114,137,165,189,63,65,86,124,193,10,16,21,24,77,179,103,117,132,175,205,12,51,98,118,42,92,105,169,176,177,39,50,131,181,2,62,126,184,20,34,82,89,123,125,153,174,182,11,30,134,162,190,38,183,29,68,133,138,130,94,122,55,91,100,47,178,171,22,185,168,31],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

When activated, cruise control keeps the vehicle at a consistent speed, typically between 30-120 mph, depending on the vehicle model. \n\nThe cruise control button usually has an icon that resembles a speedometer with a line through it, or a speedometer with a horizontal line. When pressed, it engages cruise control and maintains the set speed. To deactivate cruise control, the driver typically needs to press the button again or use the brake pedal.\n\nCruise control can be particularly useful for long highway drives, as it helps maintain a steady speed and reduces driver fatigue. It can also improve fuel efficiency by reducing the need for constant acceleration and deceleration. However, it's important to note that cruise control should not be relied upon for long periods, especially in changing traffic conditions, as it may not be able to react quickly enough to sudden stops or changes in speed.","source":"data/test/zdx_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[182,120,36,168,171,13,83,220,5,84,187,151,226,124,201,239,175,19,21,276,221,241,85,178,207,243,275,35,190,112,41,209,52,119,184,198,267,11,79,240,10,28,34,135,199,272,18,121,15,31,53,160,301,131,340,123,29,134,136,197,347,82,203,139,271,342,154,158,211,236,242,26,80,90,200,213,235,51,269,37,98,114,148,161,164,248,295,6,49,224,225,254,286,289,142,206,260,268,188,296,228,229,231,234,48,223,261,262,70,92,100,144,157,191,343,344,8,47,54,60,159,181,202,288,25,86,117,172,258,16,55,179,204,263,4,7,43,45,149,156,205,246,270,345,346,173,192,218,300,329,338,341,30,94,106,111,113,127,150,185,303,305,17,81,118,126,180,12,20,42,58,152,153,163,195,214,14,24,46,75,107,141,186,210,215,216,73,130,193,249,339,22,88,101,169,174,177,208,217,230,247,299,302,2,56,78,91,162,194,266,277,283,313,40,76,77,87,104,122,133,227,232,237,255,290,298,311,335,44,59,63,102,115,167,238,257,324,9,39,50,57,64,65,72,170,176,189,280,297,334,32,66,110,145,183,233,3,61,62,71,97,125,222,252,259,284,306,315,325,27,96,103,109,264,273,316,319,74,95,105,292,310,108,155,196,219,287,293,304,312,328,33,93,143,212,265,278,330,253,279,291,309,322,331,38,146,165,294,307,67,132,138,89,129,244,333,250,274,314,326,332,308,336,128,337,147,320,69,317,321,99,245,116,140,282,137,281,285,323,1,327,318,349,166,256,23,251,68,348],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

This condition is significant for several reasons:\n\n1. The text states that if the recommended pressure cannot be reached after 25 minutes, \"the tire is too severely damaged and the tire sealant and compressor kit cannot inflate the tire.\"\n\n2. It advises removing the power plug from the accessory power outlet and unscrewing the inflating hose from the tire valve.\n\n3. The text emphasizes that \"the tire is not sealed and will continue to leak air until the vehicle is driven and the sealant is distributed in the tire.\"\n\n4. It recommends driving the vehicle 8 km (5 mi) immediately after turning off the kit to distribute the sealant.\n\nThis condition indicates that the tire damage is too severe for the tire sealant to be effective. The 25-minute limit is likely a safety measure to prevent further tire damage from prolonged inflation attempts. By stopping immediately, the driver avoids potentially dangerous situations like losing control of the vehicle due to a severely damaged tire. The recommendation to drive 8 km (5 mi) afterward is to ensure the sealant is properly distributed and the tire is sealed before continuing to drive.","source":"data/test/zdx_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[299,297,298,301,296,300,346,287,347,256,295,279,286,44,61,96,202,288,100,162,219,212,262,315,340,345,197,229,294,110,163,186,253,265,133,196,211,227,289,304,191,205,309,89,104,114,237,248,258,284,19,94,113,159,174,221,228,254,278,303,330,59,178,190,222,259,42,160,255,263,292,4,50,81,184,192,203,204,55,164,170,195,224,290,63,73,173,269,291,56,57,95,99,176,230,236,261,308,312,72,145,193,199,201,214,233,307,338,14,60,88,168,2,8,210,225,226,247,305,310,9,24,43,45,62,65,76,119,161,180,220,235,327,342,33,51,71,158,177,198,267,324,41,75,97,122,151,155,208,231,238,239,283,12,87,93,172,206,223,325,29,49,84,92,118,200,246,249,302,314,335,341,16,32,169,179,264,282,313,25,53,167,175,280,67,74,144,188,240,339,343,35,46,52,102,171,217,218,271,281,323,54,58,120,150,266,285,306,320,66,141,241,244,275,3,31,47,183,234,242,293,10,26,85,154,216,270,311,326,331,344,20,36,39,48,98,109,189,232,257,34,107,123,182,187,213,245,13,21,27,78,82,103,115,157,194,277,322,117,129,132,146,156,332,7,30,83,105,135,17,18,77,111,165,185,215,272,64,134,140,142,274,116,86,139,329,38,101,209,243,11,70,149,328,131,153,181,79,106,130,137,148,252,260,321,333,334,336,121,112,136,138,273,23,40,143,6,22,125,276,316,69,124,268,317,37,91,15,126,80,128,207,108,319,337,68,152,147,250,318,90,166,348,127,28,251,5,349,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This combination allows the heat sink to maintain a lower temperature than the processor, which is essential for maintaining performance and preventing thermal throttling.\n\nThe heat sink's placement also allows for proper airflow within the laptop. The fan, which is often located at the bottom of the laptop, draws in cool air and expels it through vents, creating a cooling cycle that helps to maintain the overall temperature of the device. This airflow pattern is critical for preventing overheating and ensuring that the laptop operates efficiently and reliably.","source":"data/test/inspiron_16_plus_7630.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[65,66,12,73,9,35,76,11,44,58,75,10,38,67,68,83,61,69,49,79,13,55,63,70,34,48,51,52,42,50,78,82,43,46,41,7,39,45,54,72,15,77,29,71,80,81,84,47,8,62,3,59,22,27,32,64,95,56,94,23,60,2,33,30,57,53,74,40,31,4,16,36,100,1,25,87,17,24,99,21,37,26,96,5,97,101,88,90,98,14,89,18,86,91,92,28,20,19,85,93,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

These failures are characterized by an immediate and complete loss of device functionality. An example of a catastrophic failure is a memory DIMM that receives a static shock and immediately generates a \"No POST/No Video\" symptom, accompanied by a beep code indicating missing or nonfunctional memory. This type of failure is more easily recognizable and can be immediately identified upon occurrence.\n\nIntermittent failures, which account for about 80% of ESD-related failures, are more difficult to recognize and troubleshoot. These failures occur when a static shock weakens a trace on the component, but the immediate outward symptoms are not immediately apparent. The weakened trace may take weeks or months to melt, during which time it can cause degradation of memory integrity, intermittent memory errors, and other performance issues. This type of failure is less visible and may not be immediately recognizable, making it more challenging to diagnose and address.\n\nIn summary, catastrophic failures are more immediate and easily identifiable, while intermittent failures are more subtle and can be harder to detect and troubleshoot.","source":"data/test/inspiron_16_plus_7630.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[32,31,33,94,29,96,2,3,95,30,98,53,101,26,7,8,97,99,20,90,16,12,5,6,100,23,36,87,19,22,91,27,88,86,92,93,89,24,25,72,1,76,85,43,9,14,28,80,10,13,73,21,60,37,70,77,11,50,18,41,39,17,38,78,15,79,66,82,83,59,71,44,4,34,65,49,75,55,61,62,64,74,52,68,35,54,67,42,46,48,40,84,47,45,57,51,56,58,69,63,81],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The key difference between these two modes is the presence of a fan in the Convection Bake mode.\n\nIn Bake mode, the oven uses a single heating element to heat the air inside the oven. This creates a more traditional cooking environment where heat is distributed evenly around the food, but the air circulation is limited.\n\nIn contrast, Convection Bake mode uses a fan to circulate the heated air more efficiently throughout the oven. This results in faster and more even cooking, as the hot air is constantly moving and reaching all parts of the food.\n\nThe presence of the fan in Convection Bake mode can significantly affect the cooking process in several ways:\n\n1. Faster cooking times: The fan helps distribute heat more quickly and evenly, potentially reducing cooking times by up to 25% compared to Bake mode.\n\n2. More even cooking: The constant air circulation ensures that all parts of the food are exposed to the same temperature, leading to more consistent results.\n\n3. Better browning and crisping: The fan helps create a more even brown crust on baked goods, as the hot air circulates around the food.\n\n4. Energy efficiency: While the fan uses some additional power, the overall energy consumption may be lower due to potentially shorter cooking times.\n\n5. Versatility: Convection Bake mode can be used for a wider range of recipes that benefit from even air circulation, such as roasts, casseroles, and breads.\n\nOverall, the Convection Bake mode offers improved cooking performance and efficiency compared to the traditional Bake mode.","source":"data/test/bespoke_nsi6d_99_series.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,35,32,33,40,49,191,58,27,41,107,101,115,37,196,31,80,26,106,127,52,190,43,109,180,189,42,56,125,99,165,3,51,54,110,209,12,24,30,197,53,68,208,25,133,8,19,65,105,211,18,28,36,100,111,116,198,23,98,114,186,187,15,118,205,207,64,119,159,38,124,129,192,34,93,117,128,176,184,10,97,177,200,210,13,178,179,20,21,59,102,104,161,181,17,45,126,185,195,206,55,60,77,203,69,112,122,140,172,194,5,29,44,47,82,103,155,173,199,201,227,11,39,91,131,139,157,162,166,216,2,46,67,84,108,121,154,222,226,50,86,212,219,4,61,89,163,174,220,66,88,143,168,215,9,79,145,188,141,183,213,87,170,171,48,92,175,224,225,63,158,167,57,182,202,78,113,120,156,130,169,76,96,144,221,95,164,85,94,146,193,223,14,62,83,123,204,142,22,70,74,234,137,230,132,16,214,160,228,135,217,134,232,152,7,72,138,73,218,231,136,81,149,90,150,71,233,151,148,153,229,1,147,75],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Explain why cloning your computer's MAC address to your router might be necessary when using a cable modem for internet access, and describe the potential issue that could arise if the router's default LAN IP address conflicts with your existing modem/router.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[105],"raw_output":"","pred":"Cloning your computer's MAC address to your router is necessary when using a cable modem for internet access because some internet service providers (ISPs) register the MAC address of your computer when you first access the internet through their cable modem.  If you then add a router to share the internet connection, the ISP may reject it because the registered MAC address has changed.  This is because the ISP associates the MAC address with the specific computer, and a new router with a different MAC address is considered a different device.\n\nA potential issue arises if the router's default LAN IP address conflicts with the IP range of your existing ADSL modem/router.  Most TP-Link routers use 192.168.0.1/192.168.1.1 as their default LAN IP address.  If this conflicts with your existing modem/router's IP range, the router will not be able to communicate with the modem, preventing internet access.  To resolve this, you need to change the router's LAN IP address to a non-conflicting one, such as 192.168.2.1, and then restart both the modem and the router.\n","source":"data/test/archer_ax21.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[105,104,18,12,72,19,15,75,101,106,53,57,103,9,54,77,60,61,27,93,107,17,40,65,74,87,92,21,29,58,64,73,69,13,24,55,90,28,108,78,22,38,49,44,56,91,51,98,66,109,25,37,46,3,5,52,59,62,82,88,89,68,26,67,23,63,83,96,2,76,86,94,79,16,35,39,50,102,36,97,6,33,32,20,41,99,110,84,100,31,80,81,111,4,85,95,71,11,8,14,34,112,10,45,43,47,30,70,7,1,48,42],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What are the potential long-term consequences of exposing a computer drive to electrostatic discharge, even if the drive appears to function normally immediately after the event?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[30],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exposing a computer drive to electrostatic discharge (ESD) can have significant long-term consequences, even if the drive appears to function normally immediately after the event. ESD can cause subtle damage to the internal components of the drive, such as the microcircuits and sensitive electronic components. This damage might not be immediately apparent, but it can lead to degradation over time.\n\nThe internal layers of the drive may be compromised, reducing the drive's overall life expectancy. This can result in increased failure rates, data loss, or reduced performance. The drive might continue to function for a while, but its reliability and efficiency will gradually decline. Additionally, the damage can affect the drive's ability to read and write data accurately, potentially leading to errors or loss of data.\n\nFurthermore, ESD can cause the drive to overheat, which can further exacerbate the damage and potentially lead to permanent failure. The drive might also become more susceptible to other forms of damage, such as mechanical stress or temperature fluctuations, due to the weakened internal structure.\n\nIn summary, while a drive might appear to function normally immediately after an ESD event, the underlying damage can lead to reduced performance, increased failure rates, and potential data loss over time. Proper handling and grounding techniques are crucial to prevent ESD damage and ensure the longevity and reliability of computer drives.","source":"data/test/spectre_x360.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[30,33,91,34,4,35,31,85,75,40,83,36,3,20,77,29,54,57,38,76,82,11,92,12,32,59,56,19,27,41,74,23,5,48,67,78,2,14,15,47,64,80,81,88,79,63,39,37,61,93,13,60,68,66,84,18,49,86,45,53,55,65,6,58,24,71,87,50,62,70,51,42,73,16,8,90,69,9,46,43,26,17,22,21,52,1,44,25,72,7,10,28,89],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Here's a challenging question based on the target text:\n\nWhat might be a potential reason for adjusting the touchpad sensitivity, and how could this affect a user's experience with their device?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[25],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the target text, there are a few potential reasons a user might adjust the touchpad sensitivity:\n\n1. Personal preference: Some users may prefer a more sensitive touchpad for quicker scrolling or swiping, while others may prefer a less sensitive touchpad for more precise control.\n\n2. Hand size: Larger hands may find a more sensitive touchpad easier to use, while smaller hands may prefer a less sensitive touchpad to avoid accidental swipes.\n\n3. Task requirements: Different tasks may require different levels of touchpad sensitivity. For example, graphic design work may benefit from a more sensitive touchpad for precise cursor control, while web browsing may be more comfortable with a less sensitive touchpad.\n\n4. User comfort: Some users may find a more sensitive touchpad uncomfortable to use for extended periods, while others may not notice any difference.\n\nAdjusting touchpad sensitivity can significantly affect a user's experience with their device. A more sensitive touchpad can make scrolling and swiping faster and more efficient, but may also lead to accidental gestures. A less sensitive touchpad can provide more precise control, but may require more effort to move the cursor. Ultimately, the optimal sensitivity setting will depend on the user's individual preferences and the specific tasks they perform on their device.","source":"data/test/nitro_v_15.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[25,3,11,79,12,22,80,23,20,24,4,84,21,83,14,51,19,30,52,96,7,75,10,68,74,76,45,26,54,61,6,46,66,73,78,93,34,39,43,60,89,59,86,8,47,65,27,38,44,33,62,88,95,5,29,92,1,28,50,64,15,18,37,56,90,16,58,63,71,81,85,53,87,91,17,57,9,35,42,49,69,70,94,40,48,2,13,31,67,77,36,41,32,55,72,82],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target tables in the document:\n\nWhat key piece of information would differentiate between a cloud login and a local login when reporting issues to Linksys, and how might this impact user privacy considerations?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[20],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key piece of information that would differentiate between a cloud login and a local login when reporting issues to Linksys is the \"Login Type\" field. This field indicates whether the login is through the cloud (showing the associated email address) or local (displaying \"Router admin\").\n\nThis differentiation is important for user privacy considerations because it allows Linksys to tailor their response and data collection based on the login type:\n\n1. Cloud login: The associated email address is shown, which could potentially be linked to other personal information. Linksys would likely use this information to provide more personalized support and potentially gather more data for product improvement.\n\n2. Local login: The login type is \"Router admin\", which suggests a more secure and private login.

{"question":"How can adjusting the position of your phone during a call improve your experience while using hearing aids?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[193],"raw_output":"","pred":"Adjusting the position of your phone during a call can significantly improve your experience when using hearing aids. Hearing aids are designed to amplify sound, but they can also pick up ambient noise and feedback, which can interfere with the clarity of the call. By rotating or moving the phone to the best position for speaking and listening, you can minimize these issues.\n\nFor instance, placing the phone closer to your mouth can enhance the clarity of your voice, making it easier for the other person to hear you. Conversely, positioning the phone away from your ear can reduce feedback and ambient noise, improving the overall sound quality. This adjustment is particularly beneficial when using hearing aids, as it helps in balancing the volume and reducing the risk of feedback loops that can occur when the hearing aid's microphone is too close to the speaker.\n\nAdditionally, using the phone's speaker mode can further enhance the audio experience by providing a more direct and louder sound, which is especially useful for those who rely heavily on hearing aids. By experimenting with different positions and modes, you can find the optimal setup that maximizes the effectiveness of your hearing aids and enhances your call experience.","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[193,239,102,38,156,194,240,245,103,5,107,100,160,159,23,65,101,6,19,129,162,45,175,230,238,40,118,242,105,106,147,163,196,228,164,24,26,61,237,4,192,21,140,176,113,58,117,151,219,232,115,9,82,166,47,50,81,104,190,203,7,95,150,191,254,13,46,186,56,227,236,55,63,90,174,226,41,78,108,205,29,51,153,169,30,109,134,157,62,152,218,110,231,16,70,91,173,241,3,11,114,143,195,8,20,136,158,177,207,243,252,258,42,52,112,208,57,111,161,222,14,49,73,96,99,122,244,178,224,35,184,198,211,257,94,144,168,25,53,64,87,130,234,131,138,146,206,223,44,69,139,209,247,260,18,54,93,185,225,98,126,154,183,33,59,132,167,212,249,255,27,48,60,75,135,148,165,204,210,216,251,119,246,15,36,97,133,188,214,31,137,189,197,253,34,233,172,200,201,217,248,12,74,125,141,22,123,213,259,10,17,72,250,2,32,37,39,116,170,199,142,68,120,155,179,182,28,84,171,180,256,88,127,71,145,229,67,92,221,86,89,187,202,79,83,181,80,128,215,85,121,220,76,66,77,43,124,235,149,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This icon differs from the icon showing a connection to a cellular/mobile network with full signal in several ways:\n\n1. **Appearance**: The roaming icon is a small triangle pointing upwards, while the full signal icon is a more complex symbol that includes a phone receiver and a signal strength indicator.\n\n2. **Meaning**: The roaming icon signifies that the device is connected to a different cellular/mobile network, which is typically used when the device is outside its home network area. This means the device is using the network of another carrier, which can be more expensive than using the home network.\n\n3. **Context**: The roaming icon is particularly relevant when the device is traveling internationally or in areas where the home network is not available. It indicates that the device is relying on a different network provider to make calls, send texts, and access the internet.\n\n4. **Signal Strength**: While the full signal icon shows the strength of the network connection, the roaming icon does not explicitly show signal strength. Instead, it focuses on the fact that the device is connected to a different network.\n\nIn summary, the roaming icon is a simple triangle pointing upwards, indicating a connection to a different cellular/mobile network, whereas the full signal icon is more complex and shows the strength of the network connection.","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[26,105,183,104,127,247,75,236,30,135,136,254,29,250,27,237,257,238,239,77,240,258,134,230,249,24,109,35,214,168,186,231,78,142,16,79,126,68,139,204,25,61,141,112,209,31,62,113,93,125,137,147,60,157,167,192,206,45,129,4,100,6,43,132,185,81,158,203,201,101,103,246,36,146,216,15,67,229,53,138,208,219,245,13,52,85,88,179,97,176,193,166,194,234,63,121,148,177,256,55,143,165,242,71,133,140,14,72,91,170,181,196,226,37,69,70,160,260,9,33,118,244,255,59,82,144,248,54,107,145,154,20,28,76,84,90,96,128,233,34,44,131,182,23,123,130,253,18,56,66,89,191,241,98,156,162,189,213,232,17,47,83,95,108,188,41,117,180,218,251,64,116,169,51,102,159,163,173,175,187,228,5,8,124,149,195,212,42,106,110,122,200,205,225,21,86,94,227,3,19,65,73,114,151,164,199,235,48,32,92,119,207,153,40,87,210,2,12,39,74,115,171,198,217,223,46,111,150,172,252,99,184,259,80,190,222,10,50,155,7,211,215,49,57,178,38,11,161,174,221,58,243,224,120,152,202,197,220,1,22],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

In low-light conditions, the camera's sensitivity is already high, and HDR can introduce noise and graininess, degrading the image quality.\n\n3. **When you want to use the flash or the front camera:** HDR mode typically requires the camera to capture multiple exposures, which can interfere with flash synchronization and reduce the effectiveness of the flash. Additionally, HDR is not optimized for the front camera, which may not produce the desired results.\n\nHDR mode is best suited for scenarios where you want to capture the full range of brightness and contrast in a scene, such as landscapes with bright skies and shaded areas, outdoor portraits with significant contrast, backlit scenes with dark shadows and bright highlights, and when both the camera and subject are stationary. In these conditions, HDR can enhance the dynamic range, providing more detail in both the highlights and shadows, resulting in a more balanced and visually appealing image.","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,153,176,177,252,107,141,58,150,38,116,151,188,67,118,120,217,168,193,212,31,208,207,230,101,114,117,146,189,68,209,239,47,173,163,136,152,204,231,19,60,72,158,159,233,6,34,115,140,144,194,210,223,90,197,238,81,174,185,89,102,106,125,139,169,240,45,46,156,172,39,100,178,190,201,224,225,242,105,126,165,12,192,11,24,62,78,87,103,122,134,138,154,164,56,73,135,147,155,27,95,121,128,160,170,232,22,29,70,74,123,133,145,166,180,205,33,94,142,206,237,243,253,49,51,25,37,162,167,211,227,260,41,55,214,219,246,255,8,50,59,113,235,4,148,175,184,198,137,254,2,76,92,143,257,5,43,129,182,247,256,186,191,48,63,108,124,181,218,93,104,195,42,69,71,85,213,3,18,32,35,86,244,258,23,57,64,161,171,226,236,259,7,202,132,241,249,251,16,65,66,110,179,245,61,75,82,112,149,196,203,44,88,127,157,200,13,21,83,250,215,248,36,91,109,216,52,222,15,79,234,28,80,183,228,40,77,111,99,131,229,17,130,199,96,97,221,9,98,187,20,30,14,53,54,26,220,84,1,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This system enhances safety by supplementing your awareness of vehicles approaching from behind, especially in tight parking situations.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[424,363,446,333,426,441,442,352,425,427,269,439,332,354,359,115,331,361,391,428,440,443,350,360,390,438,290,330,349,137,335,344,346,351,353,365,366,433,127,200,270,355,431,116,286,289,398,282,362,372,432,540,609,133,314,334,342,345,410,429,430,434,436,437,156,337,347,371,408,422,423,444,496,99,139,142,150,265,280,283,291,324,364,392,402,413,414,417,474,56,57,64,81,104,122,152,190,276,329,376,447,456,472,108,110,112,114,165,166,175,245,259,287,327,367,373,386,388,406,452,508,526,531,107,124,129,132,145,148,176,178,185,275,295,305,325,356,378,385,412,419,445,478,529,155,174,179,182,192,281,316,336,338,348,357,377,382,403,457,491,52,65,135,138,183,186,199,274,277,303,389,396,404,407,411,421,565,23,69,83,93,181,213,218,235,249,260,266,271,284,292,296,302,323,358,397,416,435,451,465,494,506,507,524,538,543,617,30,58,66,80,82,84,85,144,151,153,177,188,219,273,285,297,301,311,328,415,418,420,455,471,490,528,542,41,63,70,73,103,146,230,236,238,240,243,251,253,272,279,293,306,313,318,381,383,463,467,473,541,577,578,586,13,44,46,49,60,95,106,111,128,159,161,184,223,244,252,262,326,370,374,375,468,612,8,35,37,86,87,113,131,147,189,206,222,227,255,264,307,315,454,466,481,523,527,530,546,579,583,585,618,20,31,45,47,67,71,72,79,90,125,130,141,211,232,248,278,343,400,405,453,470,475,522,570,580,39,42,59,89,126,143,162,168,180,187,196,242,246,261,304,310,341,380,393,401,450,469,476,521,571,572,581,608,613,614,616,17,36,88,119,158,233,237,294,312,340,479,486,548,549,38,40,48,61,68,105,220,247,267,368,369,395,477,480,532,547,109,117,191,195,204,229,241,387,394,489,544,553,43,94,123,149,164,208,210,257,339,487,495,560,121,170,228,379,409,567,568,33,54,100,120,203,299,448,552,573,55,97,154,201,226,321,499,539,550,98,118,157,169,171,512,234,300,458,533,563,3,9,74,91,136,197,212,215,587,16,163,172,239,263,615,101,384,483,537,92,167,224,225,449,492,493,569,11,62,308,464,514,18,32,134,193,198,205,216,497,534,554,102,503,559,10,29,288,525,574,576,51,160,221,250,482,498,558,564,600,28,76,268,298,575,231,582,24,50,207,516,557,595,194,214,319,556,21,53,254,500,26,75,209,509,519,596,77,399,460,520,535,584,599,34,322,536,601,78,501,511,518,217,258,202,461,589,502,515,517,566,15,462,2,4,6,25,96,256,320,485,588,598,606,610,620,12,593,603,7,22,459,562,561,590,27,604,619,1,488,545,484,597,140,173,309,5,19,555,317,594,505,605,551,504,592,602,513,591,510,14,611,607],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}
{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof load capacity can lead to several safety risks. Firstly, the vehicle's center of gravity shifts higher, making it more susceptible to rollovers during sudden maneuvers, sharp turns, or high speeds. This instability can result in loss of control, potentially leading to accidents. Secondly, the increased weight on the roof rack can cause structural damage to the vehicle, compromising its integrity and safety. Additionally, improperly secured cargo can slide or fall off the roof rack, posing a risk to other vehicles and pedestrians on the road.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to adhere to the specified weight limit of 100 kg (220 lbs) for the roof rack. Ensure that the load is evenly distributed across the crossbars and roof rack to maintain stability. Secure the cargo firmly to prevent it from shifting during transit. Avoid driving at high speeds, making sharp turns, or engaging in sudden braking. Regularly check the cargo's secureness before and during driving to ensure it remains safely in place. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents and ensure the safety of yourself and others on the road.","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[249,302,482,39,274,312,546,73,319,31,149,280,311,316,80,310,542,13,131,519,306,492,236,258,483,44,148,303,418,541,42,201,301,309,344,263,454,596,94,315,507,547,49,269,307,395,238,479,66,122,444,43,95,281,130,305,617,74,79,481,129,253,317,513,69,88,268,313,318,10,63,116,203,243,275,285,491,514,45,240,548,67,87,198,357,455,51,65,71,92,292,391,486,509,539,549,85,159,220,244,456,495,538,40,61,93,143,218,252,410,493,72,104,150,156,291,398,489,518,544,563,55,84,105,248,267,314,336,442,24,30,48,83,133,283,290,350,390,452,476,494,545,558,7,11,41,111,125,141,183,211,296,400,425,429,578,32,36,90,151,289,293,393,475,485,614,86,175,192,261,304,590,70,147,242,308,618,52,64,110,246,265,327,337,352,91,102,270,349,412,457,565,35,68,155,204,212,427,446,478,570,585,586,8,123,137,196,297,342,468,506,537,584,17,53,181,227,230,351,355,359,423,571,81,219,341,420,37,108,127,282,472,499,521,572,9,23,234,295,445,461,54,56,103,114,247,260,273,330,335,419,467,616,12,29,33,144,146,262,430,526,28,46,57,135,166,241,255,294,324,326,333,356,358,413,451,470,560,561,58,134,200,228,232,251,325,415,473,474,508,532,533,615,3,107,205,362,428,440,490,59,213,366,424,527,82,142,145,158,233,286,339,367,530,552,564,573,199,371,374,381,414,453,480,577,579,613,76,132,138,161,165,299,361,363,372,543,555,587,157,162,194,237,354,380,465,554,47,75,124,152,195,197,284,360,365,394,435,463,471,575,38,98,189,193,458,528,553,106,128,209,259,264,345,385,417,431,441,466,525,50,185,208,271,343,524,153,154,223,331,397,477,557,569,589,598,16,34,60,89,117,184,215,332,411,551,595,97,113,300,383,396,406,448,531,534,535,550,26,27,160,408,556,112,115,364,416,520,574,62,119,266,272,276,288,402,422,433,503,540,599,109,182,239,254,329,369,469,522,576,188,328,340,386,421,484,529,593,609,78,179,225,277,399,426,121,338,379,392,401,77,177,186,206,278,334,370,387,405,443,568,99,171,377,436,459,464,515,523,298,403,432,488,18,384,388,487,517,608,100,120,163,174,190,217,348,368,597,126,178,210,226,323,437,176,229,376,450,612,222,224,373,382,536,1,25,118,136,139,231,287,404,245,566,581,216,257,279,347,375,434,449,498,378,594,180,511,600,605,191,580,592,167,221,438,439,496,559,346,389,407,447,582,172,202,321,173,214,168,170,187,207,583,21,235,353,504,505,567,601,604,20,22,250,462,502,501,460,497,101,169,2,4,6,19,96,256,320,512,562,588,606,610,620,15,164,611,140,500,603,409,602,322,5,516,619,14,591,510,607],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The cyclist's bicycle, made of material that doesn't reflect radar signals, can interfere with the system's ability to track the cyclist.  Additionally, if the cyclist is wearing clothing or equipment that makes them difficult to detect, the system may overlook them.  The cyclist's speed, posture, and mobility can also affect detection.  If the cyclist is moving quickly, in a low posture, or has impaired mobility, the system might not recognize them as a potential collision threat.  Furthermore, if the cyclist is wearing clothing that blends into the background or is difficult to distinguish from similar structures, the system may fail to identify them.  Lastly, if the cyclist is part of a group or large crowd, the system might struggle to isolate and track the individual cyclist.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[339,343,340,341,342,337,335,344,330,336,325,329,332,331,333,200,334,199,324,391,327,326,338,405,385,374,412,186,379,445,328,401,321,347,414,370,614,608,375,384,393,357,358,430,441,353,349,411,443,431,185,426,444,446,429,616,350,355,378,390,367,377,428,425,323,424,356,359,427,363,362,352,442,354,410,351,403,395,192,413,439,456,361,434,612,617,452,383,392,436,457,609,365,396,402,438,433,440,171,294,360,376,420,435,116,295,455,613,348,366,373,381,408,432,80,115,191,418,437,386,394,458,554,398,83,91,138,322,369,382,404,423,453,241,345,364,372,32,82,124,188,292,314,397,56,182,346,18,81,388,399,407,409,36,69,139,162,289,293,389,421,52,92,114,128,131,137,155,159,190,211,400,406,422,447,454,68,75,86,156,219,227,240,269,286,371,450,42,64,74,133,158,180,194,252,290,448,451,489,494,560,569,31,184,196,203,205,251,291,304,568,578,20,63,85,144,178,229,233,303,416,417,90,127,223,228,254,274,279,281,315,540,543,553,33,72,97,161,175,213,221,230,232,253,498,508,522,582,23,65,84,106,170,497,523,531,564,579,142,153,189,204,280,415,493,530,552,600,28,35,48,98,150,179,187,208,243,247,255,259,275,287,302,380,474,70,160,169,177,224,244,249,305,387,465,478,615,25,34,49,99,113,119,126,151,157,163,166,260,283,285,460,466,472,473,532,535,559,39,45,46,87,94,148,176,193,206,261,266,272,449,483,495,538,43,117,118,132,145,152,201,212,237,242,245,265,298,461,27,30,66,76,93,108,121,167,174,235,276,284,299,481,507,571,44,71,73,130,135,140,141,143,154,183,214,231,270,273,296,297,368,419,459,479,496,525,526,79,107,136,271,278,282,307,310,311,469,470,471,548,583,601,9,21,26,54,67,105,112,129,181,220,234,248,313,462,477,499,8,38,55,122,197,216,238,239,246,476,506,529,539,575,586,587,618,40,41,50,57,95,111,146,198,222,264,301,490,500,509,577,3,10,13,16,47,149,172,236,463,491,537,60,101,103,110,120,123,202,210,225,250,288,300,316,464,512,528,550,5,78,88,89,102,104,218,277,312,468,475,515,542,544,549,557,563,570,576,585,58,59,62,77,100,209,215,217,306,533,565,37,109,195,308,485,486,518,520,572,168,207,257,262,263,467,480,482,534,556,580,134,513,527,595,17,29,51,125,147,226,317,318,514,541,574,619,521,524,581,61,511,558,567,53,165,268,319,11,487,546,173,488,492,519,547,573,596,598,502,517,24,566,584,484,599,14,551,267,555,22,602,258,562,597,501,1,590,12,605,545,503,516,589,164,536,603,505,561,593,594,604,504,19,309,591,15,2,4,6,96,256,320,588,606,610,620,7,607,592,611,510],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

These techniques involve pruning the activations to the pth percentile, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the representation. The underlying principle that explains their performance advantage is the relationship between high activations and high parameter gradients. \n\nHigh activations in the representation layer correspond to high parameter gradients, meaning that truncation effectively projects onto the gradients with the highest variation in the representation layers. This projection captures the most informative aspects of the model's learned representations, which are crucial for distinguishing between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. By concentrating on these high-gradient activations, ASH and similar methods can more effectively identify OOD samples, as they are more likely to trigger significant changes in the model's parameters. This approach leverages the inherent structure of the model's learned representations, making it a powerful technique for OOD detection.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"custom_18k_contrastive_swift_qwen","retrieved_pages":[119,120,130,131,133],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

AGGREGATE combines the hidden embeddings of a vertex's neighbors to update its own embedding. Different aggregation operators can capture different types of interactions. For instance, a weighted average aggregation operator, as used in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), can model smooth interactions, while other operators like sum or max can capture more diverse interactions.\n\nUsing a product aggregation operator in GNNs, as discussed in the text, allows the network to model interactions that are polynomial functions of the input features. This is particularly useful because polynomial functions can capture complex interactions that are not easily modeled by simpler aggregation operators. The product aggregation operator ensures that the network can represent interactions that are separable or non-separable, depending on the structure of the graph and the input features.\n\nThe implications of using a product aggregation operator are manifold. It enables the GNN to model a broader class of functions, which can be crucial for tasks requiring nuanced interaction modeling. This flexibility can lead to improved performance in tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, where the ability to capture complex dependencies between nodes is essential.

The text notes that real-world elections often lack a universally supported candidate and exhibit a wide range of approval scores, which is reflected in the statistical cultures. Additionally, real-world elections are characterized by the presence of cohesive groups, where many voters belong to 1-cohesive groups.\n\nThese features imply that real-world elections are more complex and less predictable compared to the simpler, more controlled environments modeled by statistical cultures.

Specifically, it guarantees that if either party's memory is tampered with, the shared secret will either remain unchanged or be discarded. This is achieved by ensuring that the outputs \\(R_A\\) and \\(R_B\\) are either both valid or both invalid, depending on whether the memory tampering occurred. If the memory is tampered with, the shared secret is discarded, and the protocol aborts, ensuring that the adversary does not gain any useful information.\n\nMoreover, the 2NMExt function is designed to be robust against active adversaries who can tamper with the messages sent between Alice and Bob. By splitting the shared secret into parts and verifying their integrity, the protocol ensures that any tampering is detected, and the shared secret is either maintained or discarded, thereby maintaining the security of the communication.","source":"data/test/2406.16313.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"custom_18k_contrastive_swift_qwen","retrieved_pages":[102,104,105,106,107],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The table shows that as the batch size increases from 1000 to 1000, the success rate reaches 100%, but there is a slight increase in both tracking error and acceleration.\n\nThe tracking error increases from 3.06/4.65/1.56 to 3.06/4.65/1.56, and the acceleration increases from 0.166/0.31/0.03 to 0.166/0.31/0.03. This indicates that while the success rate improves significantly, the performance metrics related to tracking and acceleration do not improve further.\n\n \n\nThe reason for this trend is likely due to the optimizer needing to take more detours to ensure collision-free trajectories as the batch size increases. With more batches, the optimizer has more opportunities to explore different paths, which can lead to more detours and thus higher tracking errors and accelerations.\n\n \n\nThe trade-off is between success rate and performance metrics. \n\n","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"custom_18k_contrastive_swift_qwen","retrieved_pages":[65,66,67,75,94],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"In the provided diagram, the set \\( B \\) is represented by a vertical line intersecting the triangle at points \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).

The set \\( B \\) is defined by a linear constraint, represented by the vertical line intersecting the triangle. Points \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are maximal elements in \\( B \\), meaning there is no other element in \\( B \\) that is strictly preferred to them. However, \\( q \\) is not obtained via the maximum entropy principle, as \\( \\argmax_B H = \\{p\\} \\), indicating that \\( p \\) is the element maximizing Shannon entropy within \\( B \\).\n\nThis scenario highlights a limitation of the maximum entropy principle: it may not always yield all maximal elements of a preorder. In this case, \\( q \\) is a maximal element in \\( B \\) but is not the result of maximizing entropy. This implies that the maximum entropy principle is not sufficient to capture all maximal elements in certain bounded sets, particularly when the set is defined by linear constraints.\n\nThe implications for the optimization of injective monotones in preordered spaces are significant. While injective monotones can represent all maximal elements, the maximum entropy principle, being a specific type of injective monotone, may not always be effective in identifying all maximal elements. This suggests that other optimization principles or methods may be necessary to ensure that all maximal elements are captured, especially in bounded sets with specific constraints.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"custom_18k_contrastive_swift_qwen","retrieved_pages":[74,152,153,154,165],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

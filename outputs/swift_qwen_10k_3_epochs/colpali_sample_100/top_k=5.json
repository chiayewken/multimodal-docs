This pruning is based on the pth percentile of activations, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the representation. The underlying principle is that high activations correspond to high parameter gradients, meaning that the truncated representation focuses on activations that are most sensitive to parameter changes.\n\nBy truncating activations, ASH effectively projects the representation onto a subspace where the parameter gradients are high. This subspace captures the most significant variations in the model's learned adjustments, which are crucial for distinguishing between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. The truncation process thus enhances OOD detection by emphasizing the most relevant features for classification, as indicated by the high parameter gradients.\n\nThis approach is supported by the observation that the number of training data often exceeds the number of parameters, leading to a convergence of training gradients to a smaller subspace. By truncating the basis of these gradients, ASH effectively captures the most informative aspects of the model's learned representations, thereby improving its ability to detect OOD data.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[130,131,133,120,119,132,142,139,121,128,6,134,118,127,129,191,148,51,61,31,179,183,37,38,78,122,190,22,194,146,170,56,57,138,145,149,123,186,13,193,28,60,172,189,34,85,90,39,171,168,169,77,103,188,30,24,32,72,102,7,48,91,92,153,178,26,33,35,41,143,167,180,182,105,109,111,150,165,4,20,21,42,163,36,71,113,137,174,40,44,58,84,185,195,80,110,184,27,82,136,152,177,47,55,62,66,93,144,68,154,161,83,23,29,45,54,75,112,160,166,1,99,124,135,176,187,88,8,18,59,81,95,158,5,79,25,64,73,74,96,107,11,16,49,117,50,94,126,89,104,147,9,125,155,12,65,181,76,97,14,17,63,43,69,86,46,115,175,53,108,156,157,151,173,52,162,192,15,87,98,114,140,141,67,100,116,10,106,164,101,159,70,2,3,19],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof rack's 100 kg (220 lbs) capacity can lead to several safety risks.  Overloading can cause the roof rack to become unstable, potentially leading to a collapse during driving. This collapse could result in cargo falling off the roof, posing a risk to other road users and damaging nearby objects.  Furthermore, the increased weight shifts the vehicle's center of gravity higher, making it more susceptible to rollover in sharp turns or sudden braking.  This instability can also affect braking performance, increasing the risk of an accident.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, always distribute the load evenly across the crossbars and secure it firmly.  Avoid carrying heavy or large objects that exceed the roof rack's capacity.  Regularly check the roof rack for signs of wear or damage before loading.  If possible, use a cargo net or tie-downs to further secure the load.

This represents an increase of US$8,145,000 in financial liabilities at amortized cost from 2022 to 2023.\n\nThe increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost suggests that the company has taken on additional debt or other financial obligations that are amortized over time. This could indicate a shift in the company's financial strategy, possibly involving increased borrowing to fund operations, investments, or expansion. The rise in trade payables and lease liabilities also suggests that the company may be managing higher operational costs or securing longer-term commitments.\n\nThe implications of this increase in financial liabilities include potential higher interest expenses, which could impact the company's profitability. Additionally, the company may need to maintain adequate liquidity to meet these obligations, which could involve strategic cash management or seeking additional financing. Overall, while the increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost may reflect growth or investment opportunities, it also necessitates careful monitoring and management to ensure financial stability and sustainability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_GPRK_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[204,205,186,107,180,196,206,218,183,24,176,210,108,170,23,27,116,198,106,127,45,207,222,184,171,174,147,173,12,41,103,119,163,192,35,113,115,181,185,55,154,165,11,21,31,168,169,188,189,224,20,152,211,231,61,79,118,178,209,220,246,22,104,117,120,160,230,36,39,135,137,145,175,179,191,197,225,18,51,121,208,105,153,161,40,88,95,109,26,111,214,66,199,249,167,172,60,64,151,223,114,125,193,38,70,134,80,158,213,46,62,219,67,177,200,212,227,32,71,17,57,142,187,93,126,228,232,29,63,162,164,166,195,42,77,241,34,56,73,112,226,25,30,54,194,242,33,37,69,102,130,143,190,215,229,50,53,248,59,97,250,49,76,91,131,182,90,129,221,16,81,122,146,217,44,78,240,253,10,68,3,13,19,43,48,157,251,15,75,58,110,4,14,86,233,247,150,236,243,89,92,99,149,239,252,28,96,98,201,203,257,259,133,244,74,132,65,87,128,83,216,100,139,141,235,256,138,85,5,72,84,124,156,144,148,245,255,101,1,2,8,136,237,52,155,254,47,258,140,123,234,238,202,82,159,260,9,6,94,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}],"rejected_response":""}

Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized as right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding short-term and long-term lease liabilities. The Company does not recognize any financing leases.\n\nFor leases with an original term of one year or less, the Company typically only includes the initial lease term in its assessment. Options to renew a lease are not considered unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew the lease. This approach simplifies the accounting treatment for short-term leases, as the Company does not recognize these leases on the balance sheet. Instead, the Company may use alternative methods to account for short-term leases, such as recognizing the lease payments as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This policy ensures that the Company's financial statements are not burdened with the complexity and potential volatility associated with short-term lease recognition, while still providing a clear and simplified representation of its lease obligations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CCEL_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[54,49,70,68,34,36,48,35,37,53,58,59,52,67,73,55,12,11,32,50,72,82,83,13,42,60,10,26,112,66,33,4,57,64,65,71,84,111,29,51,69,61,110,56,80,47,81,9,74,89,113,14,31,1,25,30,41,95,114,23,75,90,7,6,45,93,99,15,28,108,3,5,17,43,85,24,63,22,77,86,38,44,79,27,98,88,18,19,78,8,16,106,96,102,62,94,91,40,46,104,20,92,101,103,105,107,109,115,21,87,39,97,2,100,76],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

The Alpaca line shows some variability but does not have a clear increasing or decreasing pattern. The Guanaco line remains relatively flat across different reference length percentiles.\n\nThese differences suggest that the LLaMA model has a stronger tendency to produce empty outputs for longer prompts compared to the other two models. This could imply that LLaMA may struggle more with longer generation tasks or have a higher likelihood of generating an early EOS token when faced with longer input sequences.\n\nThe distinct patterns across models may have implications for understanding their respective strengths and weaknesses in generating longer outputs.

In contrast, Alpaca and Guanaco show more stable behavior, though Alpaca does exhibit a slight increasing trend.\n\nOverall, these differences highlight how different large language models may exhibit varying patterns in their generation behavior, which could impact their suitability for different types of tasks or applications that involve generating longer outputs.","source":"data/test/2408.16241.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[60,58,25,22,39,55,87,6,71,61,94,51,91,93,99,3,24,31,92,100,113,37,40,115,102,4,56,59,112,5,72,95,101,114,44,118,45,57,69,105,70,103,107,32,68,79,83,19,53,85,12,23,49,67,84,2,7,86,89,14,16,30,21,35,106,110,77,80,88,111,18,20,42,104,8,27,75,108,47,52,66,116,13,43,46,82,64,76,90,15,50,117,11,54,109,41,73,10,17,26,28,63,74,62,65,48,36,38,78,81,9,98,96,97,29,33,34,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}],"rejected_response":""}
{"question":"How does the choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) influence the network's ability to model interactions between vertices, and what are the implications of using a product aggregation operator in this context?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[61],"raw_output":"","pred":"The choice of the AGGREGATE function in a Graph Neural Network (GNN) significantly influences the network's ability to model interactions between vertices. In a GNN, the AGGREGATE function combines the hidden embeddings of a vertex's neighbors to update its own embedding. Different aggregation operators, such as weighted average, element-wise sum, max, or product, can capture various types of interactions. For instance, the weighted average aggregation operator can model smooth and continuous interactions, while the max operator can capture the most significant or extreme interactions.\n\nUsing a product aggregation operator in a GNN is particularly noteworthy because it allows the network to model polynomial interactions between vertices. This is because the product aggregation operator can be represented as a tensor network, which is a graphical language for expressing tensor factorizations. This formulation enables the analysis of the GNN's ability to model interactions in an input graph by leveraging the expressive power of tensor networks.\n\nThe implications of using a product aggregation operator are manifold. It enhances the network's expressiveness, allowing it to capture more complex interactions that are not easily modeled by simpler aggregation operators. This can lead to improved performance in tasks that require understanding intricate relationships between vertices, such as social network analysis, molecular structure prediction, and recommendation systems. Additionally, the tensor network representation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the limitations and capabilities of GNNs, aiding in the development of more effective architectures and training strategies.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,62,57,172,60,58,177,5,175,176,64,180,173,179,9,59,178,186,3,65,63,71,174,74,67,204,86,76,142,203,202,68,69,72,79,82,78,84,53,4,196,40,8,41,80,85,77,81,144,184,190,23,25,183,83,187,182,7,35,193,87,88,181,13,27,50,75,167,39,89,36,70,147,33,26,52,205,14,92,21,22,42,195,11,185,54,141,188,96,24,44,66,146,38,206,12,29,32,51,189,95,56,197,55,143,148,151,149,191,100,199,132,16,49,20,119,121,122,128,47,109,159,43,105,18,37,171,201,19,150,192,34,90,94,125,133,138,30,48,111,170,198,46,17,91,15,97,158,45,120,126,200,93,194,10,168,118,145,156,2,31,103,104,164,1,153,161,28,108,110,129,154,163,98,160,123,112,169,106,107,130,134,135,139,115,131,124,137,152,113,116,136,140,162,155,127,157,99,101,165,114,166,102,117,6,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

The approvalwise distance, which measures the number of voters approving both candidates, shows that the cultures generate elections with a wide range of cohesiveness levels, similar to real-world elections. This suggests that the cultures can produce elections with varying degrees of voter alignment, which is an important aspect of real-world elections.\n\nHowever, the text notes that real-world elections tend to have low cohesiveness levels, especially in the \"lower left\" part of the grid, where there are few approvals. The statistical cultures, on the other hand, generate a full spectrum of cohesiveness levels. This discrepancy implies that the cultures may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of real-world elections, particularly in terms of voter alignment.\n\nFor the design and evaluation of proportional voting rules, this has several implications. First, it suggests that while the cultures can be useful for generating diverse election scenarios, they may not be ideal for simulating realistic elections with low cohesiveness. Second, the cultures' ability to generate elections with varying cohesiveness levels can be leveraged to test how well different proportional rules handle elections with different levels of voter alignment. However, researchers should be cautious when drawing direct conclusions about real-world elections from the cultures, as they may not fully capture the nuances of real-world voting behavior.","source":"data/test/2407.11889.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[170,15,84,154,27,150,5,39,14,11,85,123,18,79,82,161,8,95,151,197,57,175,126,157,165,19,6,54,58,172,144,152,125,35,122,147,53,109,16,120,171,190,68,113,117,146,189,13,17,105,191,55,141,193,102,119,192,12,173,9,160,36,104,156,164,174,118,166,67,69,99,100,115,56,65,185,40,111,140,34,43,81,83,114,70,71,96,142,153,97,107,112,41,49,50,66,90,149,98,124,162,7,10,28,33,45,20,29,88,155,194,23,51,59,72,78,195,196,3,37,42,62,188,38,74,86,1,76,93,103,127,132,143,148,52,60,108,30,91,92,94,168,184,44,47,61,121,134,163,21,22,48,63,64,46,32,24,133,138,136,135,130,167,186,129,159,187,101,116,128,158,131,145,2,4,169,176,31,75,139,89,25,137,110,87,106,80,178,183,26,179,181,73,77,177,180,182],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

This aids in making informed lens selection decisions based on the desired image range without having to physically change lenses and view the scene multiple times.","source":"data/test/m11p.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[92,21,91,182,95,121,168,18,119,165,39,24,17,90,100,166,34,127,183,67,33,128,40,108,114,115,123,138,75,175,38,101,120,48,105,109,87,96,117,122,104,102,56,130,77,81,82,124,88,97,176,45,86,126,129,167,179,73,110,170,53,113,178,26,42,51,57,68,144,44,47,136,16,61,94,98,107,164,181,22,93,106,132,177,160,60,103,125,2,69,146,171,8,12,54,116,13,89,174,19,84,85,112,7,43,59,111,157,20,46,52,76,118,135,50,137,158,180,99,161,3,64,134,25,55,142,65,150,155,184,41,139,147,151,172,187,4,156,5,27,133,145,169,58,148,153,9,14,36,49,143,154,23,83,141,149,152,35,37,63,70,10,78,66,131,140,159,1,185,31,62,163,173,15,30,71,74,162,6,79,11,72,186,29,80,28,32],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}],"rejected_response":""}

{"question":"What are the potential financial implications for an investor holding American Depositary Shares (ADSs) in terms of fees and currency conversion, and how might these affect the overall value of their investment?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[127],"raw_output":"","pred":"Holding American Depositary Shares (ADSs) involves several potential financial implications for investors. Firstly, the depositary bank charges fees for each distribution paid on the underlying Class A ordinary shares. These fees are deducted from the distribution before it reaches the ADS holders. Additionally, the custodian bank may charge fees for each distribution. These fees can reduce the net amount received by the ADS holders.\n\nCurrency conversion is another significant factor. The ADSs are denominated in U.S. dollars, while the underlying Class A ordinary shares are denominated in Renminbi (RMB). When a distribution is paid in RMB, it must be converted into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. This conversion can result in currency losses if the exchange rate fluctuates unfavorably. For example, if the RMB appreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of the distribution received by the ADS holders will be lower than expected.\n\nThese fees and currency conversion issues can collectively reduce the overall value of the investor's investment.

The Sinkhorn algorithm is used to estimate a correspondence matrix Π that maps embeddings from one domain to another, based on the initial seed anchors and the current approximation of the remaining anchors.\n\nIn each optimization step, the Sinkhorn algorithm is applied to the current embeddings of the target domain (e_Y) and the approximated embeddings of the source domain (e_AY). This step helps in establishing a more accurate mapping between the domains, which is crucial for the subsequent refinement of the embeddings.\n\nThe objective function, which aims to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the relative projections of the embeddings in both domains, is optimized over the embeddings of the target domain (e_AY). The Sinkhorn algorithm's role here is to provide a more precise correspondence matrix, which is used to update the embeddings in each iteration.

Firstly, the varying thicknesses and weights of the documents can cause misfeeds or jams in the ADF, leading to incomplete scans or loss of data. Secondly, the ADF might struggle to maintain consistent pressure on the documents, resulting in skewed or distorted scans. Additionally, the varying weights of the documents could affect the accuracy of the OCR process, making it difficult to extract text effectively.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Before scanning, ensure that all documents are of the same size and weight. This consistency will help the ADF handle the documents more efficiently and reduce the risk of jams or misfeeds.\n\n2. **Manual Scanning**: If the documents are of significantly different weights or thicknesses, consider scanning them individually. This approach allows for more precise control over the scanning process and reduces the likelihood of errors.\n\n3. **Adjustment of Pressure Settings**: If the ADF allows for adjustable pressure settings, you can fine-tune these settings to accommodate the varying thicknesses of the documents. This adjustment can help maintain consistent pressure and improve the quality of the scans.\n\n4. **Use of Document Guides**: Ensure that the document guides are properly adjusted to fit the width of the documents. This adjustment helps in aligning the documents correctly, reducing the chances of skewed scans.\n\nBy following these steps, you can mitigate the potential issues and ensure a more successful scanning process.","source":"data/test/pixma_tr4700_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[293,320,467,154,302,89,374,93,98,463,324,284,481,375,323,295,306,307,283,378,120,186,319,119,303,3,205,88,314,158,507,173,510,514,518,266,436,456,471,535,261,437,508,309,226,332,8,446,459,461,488,247,464,493,117,235,317,458,473,477,321,415,482,536,121,416,452,503,33,99,189,229,285,294,79,118,429,534,230,47,97,109,156,329,424,213,264,292,331,417,438,466,476,252,296,308,395,465,480,7,218,281,325,382,470,472,501,529,95,233,237,435,451,502,85,194,225,236,262,316,384,445,469,115,227,290,299,311,398,450,495,511,538,9,394,418,419,432,66,80,122,263,300,475,484,136,231,265,301,57,96,116,123,127,129,153,228,315,389,405,457,77,111,219,251,377,439,530,533,6,49,81,94,110,113,132,135,312,448,53,84,107,167,187,196,197,260,289,422,460,486,490,504,44,112,130,150,200,240,431,92,101,114,131,138,204,273,286,298,381,392,408,489,506,5,91,166,201,203,212,255,310,341,379,410,447,455,83,157,184,191,193,214,220,234,361,474,496,36,259,390,468,519,174,239,277,297,318,333,391,400,513,25,40,41,63,108,146,210,224,253,343,385,433,542,38,45,58,65,67,185,280,282,313,326,336,403,423,426,453,487,524,42,68,106,245,279,388,406,407,434,512,134,137,211,257,288,291,327,412,497,528,531,540,541,69,70,141,165,199,223,248,334,387,449,494,2,43,76,164,192,271,359,411,454,500,505,90,133,162,243,250,287,305,414,478,479,485,532,35,62,86,102,149,209,349,527,4,16,87,181,198,244,328,393,441,509,39,46,60,125,148,206,344,350,353,368,420,443,491,516,521,56,74,100,139,142,143,144,159,178,183,217,256,258,342,462,515,23,27,54,232,354,362,537,50,160,161,177,215,216,274,380,401,64,147,169,242,267,339,383,425,440,483,14,17,59,128,140,175,241,269,270,275,356,428,499,19,55,145,182,346,367,369,386,498,523,26,30,104,172,176,179,208,254,335,352,365,402,427,442,21,52,171,190,304,340,364,525,29,105,168,337,363,366,370,421,444,492,526,539,10,34,48,78,357,396,15,37,82,188,272,351,413,520,517,20,268,322,345,28,152,360,373,399,522,358,31,222,404,376,24,124,249,371,12,348,18,75,180,32,71,22,221,338,372,330,72,246,151,276,73,195,163,207,278,61,170,51,238,347,355,103,13,202,1,430,11,155,409,397,126],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

Immediate impact is measured by the interception rate, which is the percentage of successfully intercepted invaders out of the total number of invasion attempts. A higher interception rate indicates a more effective defense strategy.\n\nLong-term adaptability is assessed by the adaptability score, which reflects the defense system's ability to adapt to new or evolving threats over time. This score is calculated as the number of adaptations made to new threats divided by the total number of threats encountered. A higher adaptability score indicates that the defense strategy can effectively incorporate lessons learned from past invasions to improve future responses.\n\nAdditionally, the time to neutralize threats and the integrity of the protected area post-interception are crucial metrics. Shorter times to neutralize threats suggest a more responsive and efficient defense system, while high integrity levels post-interception signify minimal damage and effective containment of threats.\n\nBy combining these metrics, a comprehensive evaluation of the defense strategy's effectiveness can be achieved, ensuring that both immediate performance and long-term adaptability are considered.

This automatic shut-off feature helps streamline the cooking process and reduces the need for constant monitoring of the probe.","source":"data/test/bespoke_nsi6d_99_series.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[40,41,51,6,23,69,13,198,43,114,145,56,126,191,207,225,31,227,36,49,111,195,143,115,80,108,206,30,194,65,67,159,210,214,226,35,44,66,116,124,128,196,17,32,68,131,184,192,224,11,110,129,37,50,64,87,105,183,190,132,188,189,209,16,19,53,109,125,177,205,212,27,28,34,199,2,48,52,70,97,107,146,169,221,9,99,112,130,7,55,57,58,104,142,162,200,211,10,26,213,228,24,100,101,103,118,119,127,141,178,180,4,14,29,54,144,173,176,187,8,15,164,166,168,220,20,25,78,133,137,181,201,42,93,106,179,217,61,63,86,98,120,135,165,185,223,90,92,117,122,186,208,219,21,82,89,139,167,170,203,215,5,71,81,134,140,157,216,222,38,79,91,45,83,171,172,94,158,161,163,197,229,33,62,88,231,234,18,85,232,3,12,96,123,147,156,193,230,76,77,22,39,175,59,152,154,47,72,121,202,113,84,204,95,182,148,155,73,46,74,174,138,151,160,102,149,218,60,233,136,150,153,75,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}],"rejected_response":""}
{"question":"How does the concept of diagonal translation equivariance (DTE) differ from general (X × X)-translation equivariance, and what is the significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[82],"raw_output":"","pred":"Diagonal translation equivariance (DTE) is a specific type of translation equivariance where the equivariance holds only for translations along the diagonal of the space X × X. In contrast, general (X × X)-translation equivariance requires the function to be equivariant for all translations in the space X × X, not just along the diagonal. This means that while DTE functions are a subset of (X × X)-TE functions, the latter encompasses a broader class of functions that are equivariant under all translations.\n\nThe significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9 is to leverage the properties of diagonal translation equivariance to extend the equivariance to all translations in X × X. By duplicating the input (x, y) to (x, y) and (x, y'), and then applying the equivariance property along the diagonal, we can define how the function behaves under non-diagonal translations. Specifically, the duplication allows us to set up the equation π(T(τ1,τ2)a) = T(τ1,τ2)π(a) for all τ1, τ2 ∈ X, where a is an element of the space A. This ensures that the function π is (X × X)-translation equivariant, thereby completing the proof of Theorem 4.9.","source":"data/test/2408.09583.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[83,80,12,81,98,207,97,101,20,7,71,77,45,79,212,76,78,84,210,85,89,93,30,92,209,82,94,108,13,206,226,9,11,35,28,211,96,129,44,75,73,130,39,72,208,111,145,74,176,46,47,201,225,90,6,99,200,136,19,153,95,159,86,154,150,198,48,177,42,88,117,55,120,161,213,215,17,87,119,65,91,104,174,191,10,122,187,172,181,223,36,124,193,205,60,166,216,8,18,43,54,163,203,214,52,64,68,121,173,56,15,37,49,123,160,202,53,66,116,197,220,139,147,196,67,164,38,109,110,138,158,183,194,70,106,152,50,58,63,107,146,188,219,100,149,167,186,192,4,41,102,118,125,221,25,168,61,62,112,115,189,190,218,57,128,142,69,184,175,113,126,135,199,29,34,105,171,178,51,140,204,222,40,114,127,26,180,195,151,185,23,24,103,133,162,169,59,137,155,170,131,132,141,182,143,148,157,31,179,134,156,27,144,16,32,2,3,21,5,33,14,22,165,1,217,224],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

The reduction in Property and equipment and disallowed business interest expense suggests that the company's tax benefits related to these assets have diminished, possibly due to changes in tax rates or the expiration of tax benefits.\n\nThe increase in employee compensation and benefits and capitalized research and development expenses indicates that the company has recognized additional tax benefits from these areas, which could be due to increased employee compensation or higher research and development expenditures.\n\nThese changes impact the company's future tax liabilities by potentially reducing the overall deferred tax assets. If the company's future taxable income does not offset these deferred tax assets, it could result in higher tax liabilities. Conversely, if the company's future taxable income exceeds the deferred tax assets, it could lead to lower tax liabilities or even tax refunds.

Firstly, increasing the pick-and-place nozzle diameter would allow for better contact with larger components, thereby accommodating taller and heavier items. This modification would enable the system to handle components with heights exceeding the current 27 mm limit, such as rotors, and would also allow for the inclusion of larger, heavier components like 3V batteries. Secondly, upgrading the pump to a stronger model would increase the maximum lifting capacity, allowing the system to pick up even heavier components without the risk of damage or malfunction. This would be particularly beneficial for handling components with masses greater than 65g, such as the Arduino Mega micro-controller. Additionally, extending the linear potentiometer would allow for greater height adjustments, ensuring that the pick-and-place mechanism can reach components of varying heights without physical constraints. These enhancements would collectively improve the system's versatility and reliability, making it more suitable for a broader range of fabrication tasks.","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[57,56,111,46,43,58,42,40,24,39,50,45,11,54,51,55,12,8,44,32,52,112,33,72,106,109,71,114,60,80,7,37,118,113,27,47,76,107,3,22,34,35,21,102,31,13,41,78,25,84,115,83,105,26,19,36,49,59,23,75,124,17,28,48,81,20,87,126,123,127,110,85,14,86,122,53,95,73,79,89,108,90,5,9,125,97,101,66,117,128,68,70,63,93,120,91,100,121,69,15,65,119,4,67,103,6,38,62,92,1,98,99,2,18,74,104,30,116,29,94,96,61,10,82,88,16,64,77],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}],"rejected_response":""}

Initially, Whitestone REIT's return aligns closely with the S&P 500 Index, indicating similar performance. However, by December 31, 2019, Whitestone REIT's return diverges, with a notable dip, while the S&P 500 Index continues to show steady growth. This divergence suggests that Whitestone REIT faced challenges or underperformed relative to the broader market during this period.\n\nIn 2020, Whitestone REIT's return improves, surpassing the S&P 500 Index, likely due to factors such as strong performance or market conditions favorable to REITs. However, by the end of 2021, Whitestone REIT's return again lags behind the S&P 500, indicating a potential decline in performance relative to the broader market.\n\nFrom 2022 onwards, Whitestone REIT's return shows a more volatile pattern compared to the S&P 500, with periods of significant growth and decline. In contrast, the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index and FTSE NAREIT Equity Shopping Centers Index exhibit more consistent performance, with the FTSE NAREIT Equity Shopping Centers Index showing slightly higher returns.\n\nOverall, these trends suggest that while Whitestone REIT has experienced periods of outperformance, it has also faced challenges that led to underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and other REIT indices, particularly in 2022 and 2023. The volatility in Whitestone REIT's returns compared to the more stable indices indicates that factors specific to Whitestone REIT, such as property performance or management decisions, have influenced its relative performance.","source":"data/test/NYSE_WSR_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[34,2,100,110,98,107,75,76,85,87,69,106,74,82,101,86,102,117,29,10,50,81,83,88,89,105,7,55,65,78,30,35,77,80,58,5,72,94,113,79,90,95,116,71,96,73,9,114,1,92,93,3,47,109,19,59,84,99,115,4,8,37,41,91,36,64,97,104,49,119,44,112,111,16,103,43,52,62,15,20,38,51,53,28,68,70,12,39,67,40,31,45,61,120,33,42,57,108,26,48,118,46,66,18,21,24,60,22,32,54,14,25,23,11,27,17,56,63,6,13],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

Its primary function is to extract a shared secret that is uniformly random and unknown to an active adversary, Eve. The protocol begins with Alice and Bob sharing a random but not uniform string \\( W \\), and their local sources of randomness \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) respectively. \n\nIn the protocol, Alice and Bob exchange their random strings \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and then locally compute \\( R = 2NMExt(A \\circ B', W) \\). This step ensures that even if one of the sources of randomness is faulty, the protocol remains secure. The 2NMExt function is designed to extract a shared secret \\( R \\) from the combined sources \\( A \\circ B' \\) and the shared secret \\( W \\), ensuring that the extracted secret is non-malleable and secure against tampering by Eve.\n\nThe protocol then splits \\( R \\) into three parts and exchanges them between Alice and Bob to verify the integrity of the shared secret. If the exchanged parts match, it indicates that the shared secret has not been tampered with, and the protocol proceeds to extract a uniform and secure shared secret. If there is a mismatch, it signals tampering, and the protocol aborts.\n\nThus, the 2NMExt function ensures the security of the shared secret by providing a mechanism to extract a uniformly random and secure shared secret from potentially non-uniform and tampered sources, thereby enhancing the privacy and integrity of the communication between Alice and Bob.","source":"data/test/2406.16313.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[106,105,102,104,107,64,100,101,98,77,80,81,21,84,86,83,15,75,87,103,82,68,69,63,76,32,90,22,7,97,79,137,62,9,18,4,5,96,88,14,85,17,89,151,41,30,130,40,43,74,67,11,6,19,141,73,70,33,36,56,92,93,95,35,38,53,34,57,65,37,46,140,142,16,121,1,78,114,134,149,45,44,94,12,29,91,99,131,39,42,10,71,72,66,112,23,50,54,108,145,25,26,27,58,61,122,13,31,59,111,136,154,48,49,135,147,47,109,125,51,55,143,146,150,133,138,148,132,24,52,113,115,127,2,20,116,117,124,126,144,28,139,128,153,60,123,152,118,119,129,110,155,8,120,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat is the key difference between the perturbation methods \"Visual-based Splitting\" and \"Visual-based Combination\" in terms of how they affect the understanding of the text's meaning?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[102],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key difference between \"Visual-based Splitting\" and \"Visual-based Combination\" lies in how they affect the meaning of the text:\n\nVisual-based Splitting breaks down characters into smaller parts, while Visual-based Combination combines adjacent characters into a single character.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. Visual-based Splitting separates characters into multiple parts, which can change the underlying meaning of the text. For example, \"VV\" for \"W\" or \"女子\" (Woman) for \"好\" (Good).\n\n2. Visual-based Combination does the opposite - it combines adjacent characters into a single character, potentially altering the meaning. For instance, \"m\" for \"rn\".\n\nThe main difference is that Splitting changes the structure of the text by breaking characters apart, while Combination changes the structure by joining characters together. \n\nThis distinction is important because it affects how the text is interpreted. Splitting can introduce new meanings or alter existing ones by changing character groupings. Combination, on the other hand, can simplify or clarify meanings by reducing complex character structures to simpler forms. Both methods aim to modify the visual appearance of text while potentially impacting its semantic meaning.","source":"data/test/2409.00551.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[103,102,108,107,116,114,113,106,214,203,24,119,19,68,177,150,118,56,209,117,135,188,196,63,176,70,28,33,109,120,169,221,36,115,148,179,45,211,183,187,147,190,200,17,18,84,129,180,4,64,89,134,175,62,140,154,159,204,51,98,170,58,90,158,178,104,61,93,26,57,145,217,35,67,72,48,52,111,171,213,59,127,210,38,43,53,46,66,69,121,124,149,195,34,42,143,164,182,219,105,13,82,181,192,73,96,139,142,197,12,87,99,205,3,31,101,133,136,151,152,194,65,71,74,81,125,130,201,27,41,110,137,144,168,44,97,172,222,157,184,206,223,77,80,92,174,189,198,218,5,22,25,123,126,132,153,186,6,100,166,191,16,60,167,207,15,37,212,112,173,50,83,54,79,128,161,30,47,85,86,141,160,165,215,155,193,163,202,7,199,75,78,138,23,88,29,146,156,208,10,91,131,220,11,39,40,76,94,216,21,185,9,20,162,55,14,122,1,32,49,8,95,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

It prevents sudden acceleration when the accelerator and brake pedals are simultaneously depressed. This is a safety feature that helps prevent unintended acceleration or sudden movements.\n\n2. It provides a warning to the driver when the system is activated. This can occur in situations like:\n\n- When the brake hold switch is pressed while the downhill assist control system is activated\n- When the DAC switch is operated while the brake hold system is activated\n\nWhen the Brake Override System is activated, it may affect the driver's experience in a few ways:\n\n1. The driver may notice a change in the vehicle's responsiveness when depressing the accelerator pedal. The vehicle may not accelerate as quickly as expected.\n\n2. The driver may hear a warning buzzer or see a message on the multi-information display indicating that the system is active.\n\n3. The driver may feel some resistance or firmness in the accelerator pedal when attempting to accelerate.\n\n4.

If you then add a router to share the connection, the ISP may reject it if the MAC address has changed.  This is because the ISP associates the MAC address with the specific computer, and a new router with a different MAC address is perceived as a different device.\n\nA potential issue arises if the router's default LAN IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1) conflicts with the IP range of your existing ADSL modem/router.  This conflict can prevent the router from communicating with the modem, resulting in no internet access.  To resolve this, you need to change the router's LAN IP address to a different subnet, ensuring it doesn't overlap with your existing modem/router's IP range.

This is suggested by the observation that current complexity measures, including the new constrained margin measure introduced, do not always fully describe a model's performance.\n\nThis limitation relates to the field of adversarial examples in a few key ways:\n\n1. Adversarial examples often involve very small perturbations to inputs that cause models to misclassify them. Margin-based measures may not capture these subtle differences in performance that lead to adversarial vulnerability.\n\n2. The fact that constrained margins are not always fully descriptive of performance suggests that adversarial examples may not always be associated with large margins, challenging the common intuition that larger margins correlate with better generalization.\n\n3. The observation that constrained margins are not predictive of generalization for some tasks may indicate that adversarial examples are not always related to poor generalization, as they could arise even in models with good generalization performance.\n\n4. The need for more sensitive complexity measures highlights the importance of developing better understanding of adversarial examples and their relationship to model behavior.\n\nIn essence, the limitations of margin-based measures suggest that more sophisticated approaches are needed to fully understand and predict generalization and robustness in deep learning models, including those related to adversarial examples.","source":"data/test/2405.17445.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[123,17,143,16,19,3,145,6,4,78,34,22,32,73,104,31,18,46,139,103,12,35,101,136,7,131,132,140,146,5,20,25,44,70,135,26,144,147,29,71,83,80,120,137,30,36,84,110,111,41,81,24,28,138,47,124,99,79,27,33,150,21,42,45,82,100,23,114,39,141,40,112,113,148,149,66,122,77,105,98,13,64,10,130,37,97,119,142,69,49,95,43,48,76,118,11,60,116,72,96,125,161,38,55,15,94,63,102,158,53,54,121,1,9,52,107,153,155,59,62,92,117,88,50,157,68,74,106,160,162,58,65,67,115,156,51,61,87,91,163,108,154,56,8,90,75,109,159,86,93,126,57,129,89,152,165,127,85,151,134,128,14,164,2,133],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

The company does not anticipate a material change in UTBs within the next 12 months, but the timing of resolution is unknown.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MTDR_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[188,127,170,2,40,120,126,161,197,32,203,171,28,33,116,118,187,190,206,39,176,38,37,175,195,198,29,31,108,212,82,90,162,173,179,199,200,30,57,167,21,34,211,41,160,163,177,131,172,191,201,213,166,202,18,36,164,193,25,26,3,24,54,178,49,121,128,35,194,19,99,192,16,180,22,97,123,129,135,205,60,130,184,93,111,149,165,23,44,112,113,114,124,125,146,189,59,155,214,20,117,174,46,17,47,87,137,156,5,65,78,169,71,4,110,115,183,196,133,8,182,7,185,217,14,61,84,119,136,145,181,62,140,147,186,204,132,15,67,73,122,53,56,58,74,76,138,150,168,55,68,96,101,13,27,109,51,70,139,63,66,72,142,152,6,11,64,81,157,158,134,50,95,43,85,148,88,9,91,210,154,45,98,144,69,143,159,48,52,77,79,92,10,89,107,209,141,218,104,151,105,207,42,1,103,208,12,102,100,86,83,80,94,153,75,106,215,216],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}],"rejected_response":""}

As network complexity increases, the average distortion required for a successful adversarial attack decreases.  This is evident in the \"Avg Dist\" column, which shows lower values for more complex networks like FC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10 compared to simpler FC10 networks.\n\nFurthermore, the persistence of adversarial examples tends to decrease with increased network complexity.  The \"Persist (Adv)\" column demonstrates this trend, with lower persistence values for more complex networks.  This suggests that adversarial examples generated against more complex networks are less stable and more easily corrected by the network.\n\nIn contrast, the persistence of natural examples (Persist (Nat)) generally increases with network complexity.  This indicates that more complex networks are better at maintaining the original characteristics of natural images, making them more robust to adversarial attacks.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that increased network complexity correlates with lower attack distortion and reduced persistence of adversarial examples, implying improved robustness against adversarial attacks.  However, this comes at the cost of reduced persistence of natural examples, potentially impacting the network's overall performance on natural images.\n","source":"data/test/2407.11029v1.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[72,71,69,156,16,154,44,8,58,54,46,60,84,55,40,62,75,9,15,21,61,83,76,158,85,48,70,74,43,59,39,82,52,73,56,68,143,157,5,17,155,41,49,145,142,50,23,45,14,18,38,10,113,51,105,177,189,4,78,190,7,138,176,79,22,42,144,181,47,53,63,192,77,87,118,20,180,160,186,179,152,129,182,188,194,86,25,153,172,80,171,193,92,187,103,137,97,122,174,12,88,94,112,106,111,173,110,57,109,27,93,170,32,13,81,139,184,66,128,146,168,31,130,133,134,165,127,147,195,108,115,136,148,95,107,123,91,117,120,124,167,6,29,90,125,149,185,28,140,178,175,1,65,67,102,114,26,37,89,116,119,131,132,169,104,191,135,161,33,96,11,24,34,101,30,35,121,183,64,164,36,141,159,162,150,163,98,166,99,126,151,19,2,100,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

{"question":"What are the differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds between the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter in still photo shooting, and how do these settings impact the use of flash?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[908],"raw_output":"","pred":"In still photo shooting, the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter have distinct shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds. The mechanical shutter allows for a broader range of shutter speeds, from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, including a bulb setting. The electronic 1st curtain shutter, on the other hand, is limited to a narrower range, from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, also including a bulb setting. The set increment for both is 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop, with the X-sync speed for the mechanical shutter set at 1/200 sec., and for the electronic 1st curtain shutter, it is set at 1/250 sec.\n\nThese differences impact the use of flash in several ways. The mechanical shutter can synchronize with flash at any shutter speed, making it versatile for various lighting conditions. However, the electronic 1st curtain shutter has a slower X-sync speed, which means it can only synchronize with flash at speeds up to 1/250 sec. This limitation can affect the ability to freeze motion in low-light conditions, as faster shutter speeds are required to capture sharp images. Additionally, the electronic 1st curtain shutter's slower X-sync speed can lead to light leaks if the shutter speed is set to a slower value than 1/250 sec. Therefore, while the mechanical shutter offers more flexibility in flash synchronization, the electronic 1st curtain shutter is more suitable for low-light conditions where flash is essential.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[908,161,162,910,174,177,298,299,170,869,164,384,163,344,870,179,500,868,165,499,150,286,218,181,291,894,899,293,3,294,296,887,4,224,905,906,184,223,297,874,195,339,147,826,116,152,204,132,172,336,417,825,840,131,144,312,681,135,502,113,157,387,688,830,833,838,867,892,133,145,173,180,313,388,75,156,212,167,215,308,185,301,348,350,904,137,140,338,349,72,74,176,96,159,199,219,269,432,791,824,837,885,206,821,898,149,380,849,122,130,143,155,295,352,818,909,5,115,136,300,335,102,211,503,843,57,175,198,221,316,345,871,913,50,168,205,333,828,886,889,891,114,134,169,253,138,171,376,872,151,318,395,83,202,213,226,282,337,434,829,77,119,139,158,207,216,407,35,285,394,726,127,178,355,382,460,835,153,186,209,343,393,405,633,112,182,214,274,341,367,392,739,183,200,266,76,81,94,277,278,281,836,91,324,386,419,492,795,832,20,193,275,381,383,841,290,303,442,596,630,2,89,187,210,486,615,789,839,34,80,95,188,228,241,248,262,307,311,317,323,374,437,469,866,106,121,203,267,268,276,391,471,787,806,33,90,107,120,148,160,217,321,418,732,817,897,31,87,92,98,192,231,279,280,707,93,97,100,283,284,496,700,822,108,146,190,334,340,875,32,104,189,232,314,385,433,446,458,501,808,110,287,406,429,454,476,508,888,99,124,166,257,330,342,411,450,459,485,541,579,7,85,239,420,489,28,264,320,487,616,8,73,105,117,118,390,641,763,842,884,18,225,265,315,463,488,807,834,878,61,70,84,103,288,322,474,493,504,674,809,6,17,123,194,201,230,252,309,326,328,438,447,509,511,661,788,907,67,208,449,738,810,863,880,25,78,451,786,815,877,254,365,366,416,436,445,587,624,666,895,26,42,111,443,475,675,733,758,760,38,109,222,234,235,260,423,428,430,461,512,519,537,557,590,725,794,54,101,196,242,261,271,289,319,331,864,914,86,129,351,507,577,585,653,659,59,125,233,247,258,378,422,431,481,667,697,711,762,812,823,126,236,246,306,346,353,531,544,197,396,468,483,540,621,628,844,858,82,237,368,371,441,505,873,240,372,373,421,425,426,455,497,792,27,154,229,347,424,453,631,636,642,677,698,71,88,227,238,245,305,327,332,427,477,597,614,663,737,896,244,250,357,413,495,612,651,715,816,820,854,325,401,440,467,498,543,607,632,695,736,800,802,354,400,457,464,568,618,669,671,673,742,778,790,797,9,142,369,479,480,526,528,529,539,583,634,660,679,734,798,805,911,60,220,259,439,466,708,743,65,255,270,272,273,359,482,538,640,683,689,705,717,718,727,783,304,399,402,462,470,490,513,514,516,527,534,542,582,603,617,620,622,645,676,703,710,714,752,776,22,364,409,452,465,472,494,520,545,561,576,588,602,662,709,735,744,745,793,819,52,403,525,535,604,649,650,657,685,690,721,755,761,861,912,79,243,398,518,532,567,601,639,652,654,682,731,30,128,478,484,510,572,600,629,648,655,680,722,764,777,21,51,63,435,448,536,562,635,701,704,712,741,766,801,902,916,251,444,560,605,637,706,730,782,785,827,883,16,191,414,558,569,608,647,658,672,699,740,813,881,45,46,62,404,523,625,696,724,831,862,893,903,19,24,360,379,491,552,686,694,719,723,751,767,846,853,855,900,10,44,64,370,410,456,584,586,609,665,670,720,746,753,799,901,36,292,329,412,524,613,729,771,40,69,408,415,473,549,578,589,716,775,780,796,851,310,517,565,573,598,623,643,656,687,693,702,748,749,754,768,804,23,43,47,49,515,547,556,559,591,362,522,530,551,553,570,574,575,592,610,668,249,377,521,580,581,664,678,747,857,859,141,550,611,644,692,781,845,11,15,58,68,619,765,784,865,1,56,571,546,564,594,595,713,848,256,506,533,554,599,684,750,779,860,66,356,626,774,847,850,555,691,856,263,375,563,890,29,358,361,728,772,548,593,606,757,759,876,53,566,769,770,773,882,389,646,37,39,811,879,915,919,852,302,756,41,14,917,397,814,627,48,13,363,803,12,55,638,918],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

(2021)?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[256],"raw_output":"","pred":"Velez et al. (2021) explore the use of white-box analysis over machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems. The key differences and potential advantages of white-box analysis include:\n\n1. **Transparency and Explainability**: White-box models, such as symbolic regression, provide clear insights into the underlying relationships between input variables and performance metrics. This transparency allows for a better understanding of how changes in configuration options affect system performance, which is crucial for debugging and optimization.\n\n2. **Interpretability**: Unlike black-box machine learning models, white-box models like symbolic regression can be easily interpreted. This interpretability is particularly valuable in software engineering, where understanding the model's logic is essential for trust and adoption.\n\n3. **Modeling Flexibility**: White-box models can capture complex interactions between configuration options and performance metrics. This flexibility allows for the modeling of intricate dependencies that might be difficult to capture with simpler machine learning models.\n\n4. **Efficiency in Optimization**: The interpretability of white-box models can facilitate more efficient optimization processes. Developers can quickly identify which configuration options are most critical for performance, leading to faster and more targeted optimization efforts.\n\n5. **Avoidance of Overfitting**: White-box models are less prone to overfitting compared to complex machine learning models. This stability ensures that the models generalize well to new configurations, making them more reliable for real-world applications.\n\nOverall, white-box analysis offers a more transparent, interpretable, and flexible approach to modeling configurable system performance, which can lead to better understanding, optimization, and maintenance of software systems.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[256,211,242,173,212,122,172,23,177,176,180,103,191,86,102,214,96,117,95,258,130,193,251,239,178,209,243,99,19,58,74,101,128,250,132,22,59,231,240,129,65,210,234,40,51,100,213,87,56,85,104,229,246,253,60,61,260,237,144,232,235,245,255,31,151,254,257,54,119,179,236,18,20,45,79,90,157,247,52,55,69,125,148,230,244,53,57,75,116,261,76,94,155,249,63,64,105,123,134,80,67,83,106,127,146,238,2,26,32,72,78,81,88,140,203,223,112,241,49,126,169,204,259,12,68,115,136,252,43,62,66,77,215,248,8,70,84,111,174,200,21,48,156,170,71,124,147,9,29,33,150,166,3,7,168,195,25,98,207,233,14,37,143,153,121,189,192,197,5,208,222,224,82,113,152,199,225,227,92,110,137,139,161,220,226,30,44,50,97,108,202,47,131,145,186,194,114,142,163,167,175,228,107,109,120,149,184,188,41,185,11,15,133,138,162,165,190,263,91,24,181,196,274,13,118,154,158,160,217,73,135,164,264,27,39,42,89,201,159,46,187,28,183,216,218,221,6,171,93,182,35,198,141,206,267,273,205,1,219,266,271,4,262,38,265,36,272,16,269,268,10,34,270,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}],"rejected_response":""}

This suggests a more erratic performance with notable dips and recoveries.\n\nThe VanEck OIH Index, representing the oil and natural gas sector, showed the most dramatic fluctuations. It started at 100 in 2018 and experienced a sharp decline to around 50 in 2019. It then surged to about 170 in 2021, the highest point among the three indices, before dropping to approximately 70 in 2023. This indicates a high degree of volatility, with significant peaks and troughs.\n\nOverall, the S&P 500 demonstrated the most consistent growth, while Dril-Quip, Inc.'s performance was more volatile and less predictable compared to the other indices.","source":"data/test/NYSE_DRQ_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[36,8,13,52,11,60,87,6,65,86,55,56,58,20,1,38,12,57,85,81,40,59,48,80,15,9,39,89,23,79,25,82,42,67,24,74,19,21,14,71,49,7,43,16,84,75,10,17,44,46,77,5,66,26,50,76,78,4,31,51,62,69,41,63,83,33,53,29,64,27,45,35,18,70,68,72,30,47,61,22,91,92,54,28,73,2,3,32,34,88,37,90],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}
{"question":"Given the data in Table 2, what is the likely impact on tracking error and acceleration if the batch size is further increased beyond 1000, and why?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[66],"raw_output":"","pred":"Based on the data in Table 2, increasing the batch size beyond 1000 appears to have a negative impact on both tracking error and acceleration. \n\nThe tracking error increases from 3.06m to 3.07m as the batch size goes from 800 to 1000. This slight increase suggests that the optimizer may be taking more detours to find collision-free trajectories as the batch size grows larger.\n\nSimilarly, the acceleration increases from 0.136 m/s^2 to 0.166 m/s^2 as the batch size increases from 800 to 1000. This indicates that the optimizer is using more acceleration to navigate the environment, potentially due to the increased complexity of finding feasible trajectories with a larger batch size.\n\nThe performance degradation at 1000 batches could be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. Increased computational complexity: With more batches, the optimization problem becomes more complex, potentially leading to longer computation times and more detours.\n\n2. Resource limitations: The system may be approaching resource limits, such as memory or processing power, as the batch size increases.\n\n3. Suboptimal solutions: The increased complexity may lead to the optimizer finding solutions that are not as optimal as those found with smaller batch sizes.\n\n4. Trade-off between exploration and exploitation: With more batches, the optimizer may be spending more time exploring the solution space, which can lead to suboptimal trajectories.\n\nOverall, while the 1000 batch size achieves 100% success rate, the slight increase in error and acceleration suggests that further increasing the batch size may not be beneficial and could lead to performance degradation.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[66,65,67,94,75,57,26,63,52,46,64,53,93,12,19,81,82,83,56,8,95,10,100,49,14,61,54,68,98,101,55,92,90,27,47,60,44,18,37,20,48,96,77,91,71,85,78,29,43,50,6,17,32,35,70,76,80,110,34,99,89,102,103,79,87,107,45,69,41,59,84,42,24,2,112,7,30,11,31,74,86,33,15,51,58,21,62,106,38,72,28,23,25,104,108,36,39,109,88,73,13,16,97,105,40,3,9,22,5,111,4,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}],"rejected_response":""}

The set \\( B \\) is defined by a linear constraint, represented by the vertical line intersecting the triangle. The triangle represents the set of probability distributions in \\( P_X \\) for a finite set \\( X \\).\n\nIn the diagram, \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are maximal elements in \\( B \\). The maximum entropy principle, which maximizes Shannon entropy \\( H \\), yields \\( p \\) as the unique maximizer in \\( B \\). However, \\( q \\) is also in \\( B \\) and has a higher entropy \\( H(q) \\) compared to \\( p \\). This means that \\( q \\) is a maximal element in \\( B \\) but not obtained via the maximum entropy principle.\n\nThe implication of this scenario is that the maximum entropy principle does not always capture all maximal elements in a given set \\( B \\). This highlights the limitations of the maximum entropy principle in certain contexts, particularly when the set \\( B \\) is defined by specific constraints.\n\nFor optimization of injective monotones in preordered spaces, this scenario suggests that while injective monotones can represent maximal elements, they may not always yield the same results as the maximum entropy principle. This implies that different optimization principles may be necessary to capture all maximal elements, depending on the specific constraints and properties of the preordered space.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[154,74,152,153,165,189,149,163,166,178,180,191,54,190,51,322,148,151,50,49,80,266,158,179,310,341,360,99,157,183,186,184,301,169,255,339,359,185,188,265,351,78,312,354,363,29,55,150,156,193,263,336,59,146,167,187,300,308,320,345,352,64,283,305,92,104,307,343,93,160,164,194,247,319,325,333,337,108,242,249,262,297,335,72,82,97,107,170,196,313,342,362,96,192,197,256,338,346,357,364,159,162,282,304,332,198,251,287,311,318,340,73,147,161,175,248,253,278,284,356,71,182,259,264,58,63,100,168,323,347,349,101,181,199,246,252,260,281,286,299,324,334,353,30,34,67,195,201,250,270,316,344,350,13,91,105,155,302,358,254,261,271,303,355,66,116,267,269,321,348,52,62,217,47,56,65,90,95,176,258,268,272,117,366,53,94,118,245,257,368,365,25,61,112,233,288,296,298,57,121,124,200,314,317,26,48,103,119,228,285,120,215,36,60,68,137,229,244,273,280,291,331,70,81,213,222,225,238,27,38,98,106,206,237,69,172,231,89,20,171,173,177,218,243,28,35,135,224,309,14,208,230,232,19,129,226,279,306,23,134,205,211,5,131,132,214,33,113,133,290,40,114,79,85,235,315,130,207,216,239,77,125,141,234,292,24,76,86,227,369,41,87,140,37,210,295,276,367,126,138,204,277,289,6,326,361,39,88,102,145,212,328,31,43,209,21,42,219,44,127,294,9,111,122,123,136,202,221,10,115,139,223,83,327,330,1,174,2,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,18,22,32,45,46,84,110,128,142,144,236,240,75,274,275,3,241,293,220,203,329,17,370,109,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}],"rejected_response":""}

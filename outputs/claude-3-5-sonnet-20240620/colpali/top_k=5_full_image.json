As Shenzhen CA appears to be involved in e-commerce certification services, it likely falls under these restrictions.\n\nBy using contractual arrangements instead of direct ownership, Zhang Tong Shun can effectively control and receive the economic benefits of Shenzhen CA's business while complying with Chinese regulations on foreign investment. This structure, often called a Variable Interest Entity (VIE), allows foreign companies to operate in restricted industries in China.\n\nThe contractual arrangements give Zhang Tong Shun the ability to consolidate Shenzhen CA's financial results and exercise control over its operations without violating ownership restrictions.

The lapse function controls the time evolution, while the shift vector handles the spatial relationships between slices.\n\nIn the diagram, we see N dt representing the proper time separation, and N^i dt showing the spatial shift of coordinates from one leaf to the next. This allows for a flexible description of how the hypersurfaces relate to each other geometrically as the foliation progresses through time.\n\nBy choosing different lapse and shift functions, one can adapt the foliation to suit different physical scenarios or computational needs while preserving the underlying spacetime structure. This formalism provides a powerful framework for analyzing dynamics in general relativity.","source":"data/test/2407.17984v1.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","retrieved_pages":[43,75,76,232,237],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","content":"Correctness: 5 \n","score":5}]}

Shear could distort the cross-section of a light beam, potentially affecting how the apparent size or brightness of a source changes with distance. Vorticity, while typically negligible in the late universe, could in principle cause rotation of light ray bundles.\n\nThese kinematic effects could lead to subtle differences in how light propagates along future-directed versus past-directed null geodesics. This may result in small asymmetries or corrections when comparing luminosity distance (based on future-directed rays from source to observer) to angular diameter distance (based on past-directed rays from observer to source).\n\nUltimately, a careful accounting of these effects in the optical equations and geodesic deviation equation would be needed to quantify their impact on cosmological distance measures.

{"question":"Given the provided context on Bianchi cosmological models, explain why it is challenging to construct a Bianchi cosmology that exhibits significant anisotropy at late times while remaining consistent with CMB observations. What specific observational constraints make this difficult?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[122],"raw_output":"","pred":"Constructing a Bianchi cosmology with significant late-time anisotropy while remaining consistent with CMB observations is challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. Isotropy of the CMB: CMB observations indicate a highly isotropic early universe. Bianchi models predict that anisotropy decays as the universe expands, with shear decaying as S^-3 (where S is the scale factor). This means any initial anisotropy tends to be suppressed over time.\n\n2. Tight observational constraints: CMB data places tight bounds on anisotropy, ruling out models with large early anisotropy that could persist to late times.\n\n3. Rapid isotropization: Many Bianchi models isotropize rapidly toward a de Sitter state at late times, especially those with a positive cosmological constant.\n\n4. Difficulty generating late anisotropy: Producing significant anisotropy at late times without violating early universe constraints is problematic. Models that become highly anisotropic again in the far future are ruled out by current observations.\n\n5. Conflict with FLRW predictions: Bianchi models that remain consistent with CMB data tend to make predictions very similar to standard FLRW cosmology for the present-day universe.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, researchers have explored concepts like emergent anisotropy from small-scale inhomogeneities or tilted fluid flows. However, constructing a viable model remains difficult given the observational evidence for isotropy on large scales.","source":"data/test/2407.17984v1.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","retrieved_pages":[47,123,124,222,292],"judgements":[{"name":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","content":"Correctness: 4 \n","score":4}]}

(2021), offers several advantages over machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems. Firstly, white-box analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's internal structure and logic, which can be crucial for accurately capturing the system's performance. Secondly, white-box analysis can handle sparse data more effectively, as it does not rely on the availability of large amounts of data for learning. Lastly, white-box analysis can be more transparent and explainable, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind the performance model. In contrast, machine learning can be opaque, and its predictions may not be easily understood or explained.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"idefics","retrieved_pages":[173,211,212,242,256],"judgements":[]}

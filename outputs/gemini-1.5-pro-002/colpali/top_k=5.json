It normalizes the distance by the covariance matrix, giving more weight to errors along low-variance dimensions and less weight to errors along high-variance, correlated dimensions.

By processing observations locally, communication is only necessary during inter-agent joint observations, minimizing bandwidth usage.  Furthermore, IKF's modularity allows adding or removing agents without significant restructuring, enhancing flexibility.  The constant maintenance effort (O(1)) per estimator, regardless of the number of correlated sensors, ensures scalability even with growing sensor networks.

This discrepancy is attributed to the low coercivity of the soft magnetic faces.  When repulsive magnetic dipoles are brought close, they tend to re-align into an attractive configuration if not held rigidly in their repulsive orientation.  The low coercivity of the materials allows this realignment to occur, diminishing the observed repulsive force.\n\nTo account for this, the model was adjusted by applying a scaling factor of 0.09 to the predicted repulsive forces. This scaling factor effectively normalizes the magnitude of the repulsive forces to match the observed attractive forces.  With this adjustment, the normalized sum of squared differences between predicted and measured results was 0.014, indicating improved model accuracy.\n","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[15,70,96,97,98],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Smaller initializations cause component norms to evolve more slowly when small, effectively suppressing all but a few dominant components.  These dominant components are learned sequentially, aligning with the low-rank structure of the ground truth tensor.  Larger initializations, on the other hand, allow more components to grow simultaneously, hindering the model's ability to capture the low-rank nature and leading to higher reconstruction errors.

Crucially, this is a *locally connected* operation, meaning each filter interacts with only a single element of the corresponding input vector.  The number of filters corresponds to the rank (R) of the tensor factorization.\n\nThe output of the 1x1 convolution is then fed into a global pooling layer.

{"question":"What factors contributed to the increase in net deferred income tax assets from 2022 to 2023, and how might these changes impact the company's future financial position?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[79],"raw_output":"","pred":"The increase in net deferred tax assets from $(2.2) million in 2022 to $25.0 million in 2023 primarily stems from a $21 million decrease in valuation allowances against gross deferred tax assets.  This decrease indicates increased confidence in the company's ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these assets, particularly in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.  Additionally, the receipt of $23 million in tax refunds during 2023, including $20 million related to prior year net operating losses, contributed to the overall improvement.\n\nThese changes positively impact Oceaneering's future financial position.  A lower valuation allowance reduces future tax expenses, potentially boosting profitability.  The realized tax refunds improve cash flow, providing greater financial flexibility for investments and debt reduction.

Stock options are expensed using Black-Scholes, while RSUs are expensed based on the stock's grant-date fair value.  RCUs, with a cash settlement feature, are also treated as liabilities.\n\nThe key difference stems from the incentive units' structure.  Their liability classification arose from the parent company's repurchase right and the board's discretion over settlement.

These negative impacts overshadowed the positive effect of foreign deferred tax benefits.\n\nDespite the lower net income, Adjusted income from operations increased by 2%. This seemingly contradictory result arises because adjusted income excludes special items like the HCSC loss and Chubb gain, focusing instead on core operating performance.

Ordinary shareholders, voting directly, would likely approve the merger, potentially benefiting at the expense of the less engaged ADS holders.

The Homebuilders Index initially outpaced the S&P 500 but experienced a downturn in 2022-2023, though it still finished above its starting point.\n\nSeveral factors could explain these differences. Five Point's poor performance might be attributed to company-specific issues like operational challenges, debt levels, or investor sentiment related to its business model. The Homebuilders Index, being sector-specific, is more susceptible to fluctuations in the housing market, such as interest rate changes or material costs, which likely contributed to its volatility. The broader S&P 500, representing the overall market, generally experiences more stable growth, less impacted by individual sector dynamics.\n","source":"data/test/NYSE_FPH_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[33,34,50,86,88],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Unlike texting, where messages are sent discretely, RTT functions like a live text-based chat within an ongoing voice call.  This makes it ideal for people with hearing or speech impairments who can read and respond in real-time without interrupting the flow of conversation.\n\nFurthermore, RTT uses call minutes like a regular voice call, while traditional texting relies on a separate messaging plan.  RTT doesn't require additional accessories, integrating directly into the phone's dialer app.  This seamless integration makes it a more convenient and accessible option for real-time communication during a phone call compared to switching between the phone and messaging apps.\n","source":"data/test/moto_g_play.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[80,106,132,145,235],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"Explain how using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator can help minimize energy consumption, ensuring to reference the underlying physics.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[9],"raw_output":"","pred":"Thawing frozen food in the refrigerator leverages the principles of heat transfer to minimize energy consumption.  Frozen food contains a significant amount of thermal energy stored as \"cold.\"  When placed in the refrigerator, this cold is transferred to the warmer air and food within the fridge.  This process effectively cools the refrigerator compartment, reducing the workload on the refrigerator's compressor.\n\nThe compressor is the energy-intensive component responsible for maintaining the low temperature. By using the frozen food as a cooling source, the compressor cycles on less frequently and for shorter durations, thus consuming less electricity.  This is analogous to using ice packs to cool a cooler instead of relying solely on the cooler's refrigeration unit.  The ice packs absorb heat, keeping the contents cool, while the refrigeration unit works less.  Similarly, the thawing food acts as a \"cold pack,\" contributing to the cooling process and minimizing the energy required by the refrigerator.\n","source":"data/test/rf59c7_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[9,20,26,55,102],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What specific combination of factors could lead to a situation where the camera battery depletes quickly, but the charging process via USB also fails to start properly?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[164],"raw_output":"","pred":"A quickly depleting battery coupled with failed USB charging could arise from a few combined factors:\n\n1. **Cold Battery & Low-Power USB Port:** A very cold battery requires more current to charge initially. If plugged into a standard USB 2.0 port (SDP), which only provides 500mA, the port's limited output might be insufficient to overcome the battery's cold state and initiate charging.  The camera would continue draining the already low battery, exacerbating the issue.\n\n2. **High Power Consumption & Low-Power USB Port:**  Features like permanently active WLAN, high LCD brightness, or continuous Live View drain the battery rapidly.  Simultaneously attempting to charge via a low-power USB 2.0 port would provide insufficient current to offset the high discharge rate, resulting in no effective charging.\n\n3. **Dirty Contacts & High Power Consumption:** Dirty battery contacts can hinder charging.

{"question":"Under what specific circumstance might Blind-Spot Collision-Avoidance Assist (BCA) engage its braking function even if the driver is not attempting a lane change?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[351],"raw_output":"","pred":"BCA may engage braking through its **Collision-Avoidance Assist (whilst departing)** sub-function. This activates when the vehicle is moving slower than 3 km/h (2 mph) and a vehicle in the blind spot is approaching faster than 5 km/h (3 mph).  This scenario typically occurs when reversing out of a parking space.  The system detects a potential collision with a vehicle approaching from the side and automatically applies the brakes to prevent an accident.  This is distinct from the standard blind-spot warning and collision warning functions, which are triggered by the turn signal indicating a lane change intent.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[350,353,354,357,358],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}
{"question":"Under what circumstances might the Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA) system have difficulty detecting a cyclist, even if the cyclist is clearly visible to the driver?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[340],"raw_output":"","pred":"FCA may struggle to detect cyclists in several situations, even if they are visible to the driver.  The system relies on radar and camera input, which can be affected by environmental factors and the cyclist's characteristics.\n\nEnvironmental factors include heavy rain, snow, fog, or bright/dark conditions like tunnels.  Obstructions like sun glare or reflections on wet roads can also interfere.  The system may not detect a cyclist made of materials that don't reflect radar well.\n\nThe cyclist's position and behavior also matter.  If they are only partially in the system's field of view (e.g., leaning over), wearing clothing that blends into the background, or moving erratically/quickly, detection becomes challenging.  Short stature, low posture, or riding in a group can also hinder the system's ability to identify them as a cyclist.\n","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[339,340,341,342,343],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"How do the activation truncation techniques like ASH leverage parameter gradients to enhance OOD detection, and what is the underlying principle that explains their performance advantage?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[130],"raw_output":"","pred":"Activation truncation techniques like ASH, though seemingly not directly reliant on gradients, implicitly leverage them for OOD detection.  By truncating activations below a certain percentile, these methods effectively select a representation emphasizing parameters with high gradients in the representation layers.  High activations correspond to high parameter gradients through the chain rule.  This truncation acts as a projection onto the gradients associated with the most significant variations in the representation layers.\n\nThe performance advantage stems from the fact that in-distribution data will generally activate these high-variation parameters more strongly than out-of-distribution data.  OOD samples are less likely to align with the learned features represented by these high-gradient parameters, resulting in lower activations and subsequent removal during truncation.  This selective amplification of in-distribution features enhances the model's ability to distinguish between in-distribution and OOD samples.  The gEPK framework clarifies this connection by demonstrating that model predictions are built upon a basis of training data parameter gradients, and truncation techniques focus on a subset of this basis associated with high variation.\n","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[6,31,51,61,118,119,120,121,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,139,142,148,191],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This change was primarily driven by a decrease in the net deferred tax liability related to operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and operating lease liabilities, property and equipment, and disallowed business interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by increases in deferred tax assets related to employee compensation and benefits, and capitalized research and development expenses.\n\nThe increase in deferred tax assets suggests the company anticipates deductible expenses and losses in future periods, which could reduce future tax liabilities.  Conversely, the decrease in deferred tax liabilities implies a reduction in future taxable amounts.  The overall impact on future tax liabilities will depend on the timing and realization of these deductible items and taxable amounts.  For example, the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards is subject to profitability in future periods.\n","source":"data/test/NYSE_AEO_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[34,38,39,48,50,54,55,57,62,64,65,66,67,69,74,75,76,77,78,79],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Simultaneously, the persistence of adversarial examples becomes *lower* than that of natural examples.

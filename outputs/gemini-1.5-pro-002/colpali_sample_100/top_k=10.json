LLaMA's training on web data might have exposed it to situations where empty outputs are valid, while Alpaca and Guanaco, trained on conversational and QA data, are penalized for empty outputs. This implies that LLaMA might be less suitable for tasks requiring longer, more complex responses, while Alpaca and Guanaco might be more robust in such scenarios.

In 2021, all three indices saw growth, with the S&P 500 outperforming the others.  2022 brought further gains for the S&P 500 and OIH, but Dril-Quip declined again.  Finally, in 2023, Dril-Quip and the OIH Index rebounded significantly, while the S&P 500 experienced more moderate growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 demonstrated the most consistent growth throughout the period, despite some fluctuations. Dril-Quip's performance was the most volatile, experiencing significant declines followed by sharp recoveries, closely mirroring the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry represented by the OIH Index.  Dril-Quip generally underperformed both the S&P 500 and the OIH Index, except for the recovery period in 2023 where it outpaced the OIH.\n","source":"data/test/NYSE_DRQ_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[6,8,11,13,36,52,60,65,86,87],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"Given the data in Table 2, what is the likely impact on tracking error and acceleration if the batch size is further increased beyond 1000, and why?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[66],"raw_output":"","pred":"Table 2 shows diminishing returns in success rate improvement as batch size increases beyond 800, suggesting that further increases beyond 1000 are unlikely to yield significant gains in finding feasible solutions.  Therefore, the impact on tracking error and acceleration would likely be minimal.\n\nWhile a slight increase in both metrics was observed with increasing batch size (attributed to detours around obstacles), this trend is expected to plateau.  Since the success rate is already at 100% with a batch size of 1000, additional batches are less likely to uncover significantly better trajectories in terms of tracking or smoothness.  The optimizer has likely already explored the most promising homotopies.  Further increases in batch size would primarily increase computational cost without proportional improvement in solution quality.\n","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[26,46,52,57,63,65,66,67,75,94],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"In the provided diagram, the set \\( B \\) is represented by a vertical line intersecting the triangle at points \\( p \\) and \\( q \\). Given that \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are maximal elements in \\( B \\) but \\( \\argmax_B H = \\{p\\} \\), explain why \\( q \\) is not obtained via the maximum entropy principle and discuss the implications of this for the optimization of injective monotones in preordered spaces.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[154],"raw_output":"","pred":"The maximum entropy principle selects the unique distribution in \\(B\\) that maximizes Shannon entropy (\\(H\\)). While both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are maximal elements within \\(B\\) (meaning no other element in \\(B\\) is strictly preferred to them under the uncertainty preorder), \\(H(p) < H(q)\\).  Therefore, the maximum entropy principle identifies \\(p\\) as the optimal solution, overlooking \\(q\\).\n\nThis demonstrates that maximizing entropy doesn't guarantee finding *all* maximal elements.  Injective monotones offer a potential improvement. They preserve the uniqueness property of the maximum entropy principle (up to equivalence) without requiring concavity.  However, optimizing an injective monotone over \\(B\\) would still select only one equivalence class of maximal elements.  While we could construct an injective monotone that yields \\(q\\) as a maximum, the challenge lies in *choosing* the appropriate injective monotone to capture all desired maximal elements.  This highlights the inherent difficulty in representing and optimizing non-total preorders with single real-valued functions.\n","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[74,149,152,153,154,163,165,166,178,189],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

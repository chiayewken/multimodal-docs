By December 2023, Sunnova's performance had fallen below both indices.\n\nSeveral factors could explain these differences.  Sunnova's initial surge might reflect hype surrounding renewable energy companies. The subsequent decline could be attributed to company-specific factors like increased competition, supply chain disruptions, or changing market conditions within the solar industry.  The broader market performance, represented by the NYSE Composite, is influenced by a wider range of economic factors, while the Invesco Solar ETF reflects the overall performance of the solar sector, which may have been less volatile than Sunnova's individual performance.\n","source":"data/test/NYSE_NOVA_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","retrieved_pages":[11,64,68,84,120],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

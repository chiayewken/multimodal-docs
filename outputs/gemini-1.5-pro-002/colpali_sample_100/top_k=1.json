Instead, they focus on modifying the *activations* within the model's representation layer.  Given an input, ASH computes the forward pass to obtain intermediate activations.  Then, it truncates these activations by setting values below a certain percentile to zero. This effectively prunes the representation, focusing on the most salient features.\n\nWhile not explicitly using gradients for OOD detection, ASH implicitly leverages the information encoded within them.  The activations themselves are a product of the model's parameters and the input, and their magnitudes reflect the influence of different features.  By truncating less salient activations, ASH emphasizes features that the model has learned are important for in-distribution data.  Consequently, OOD inputs, which likely activate different feature combinations, will exhibit significantly altered post-truncation representations, leading to improved OOD detection.

This could restrict the company's ability to access foreign currency for dividend payments in the future, impacting ADS holders' returns.  Further, while Hong Kong currently has no such restrictions, future limitations on currency transfers in and out of Hong Kong could also impact the company's ability to meet currency demands, including dividend payments.

This matrix, derived from ranked similarities involving both the initial seed anchors and the current approximation of the remaining anchors, guides the optimization process.

DTE is thus a weaker condition.\n\nDuplicating inputs (creating input pairs (x,x)) allows leveraging DTE to prove a result about functions on single inputs (Theorem 4.9).

The non-malleability property ensures that even if the adversary modifies A1 or B1 (resulting in A′1 and B′1), the extracted outputs RA and RB will either be close to uniform and independent of each other or will be closely related in a predictable way.\n\nThis property is leveraged by comparing parts of RA and RB. If they match, it indicates W hasn't been tampered with, and the remaining parts of RA and RB (S1 and S2) are used to derive shared keys.

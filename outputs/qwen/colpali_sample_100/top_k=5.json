In a GNN with product aggregation, the AGGREGATE operator combines multiple input vectors into a single vector by taking the Hadamard product of the vectors. This results in a polynomial function of the input, which allows the network to model interactions between vertices in a more expressive way compared to other aggregation operators like sum or max.\n\nThe implications of using a product aggregation operator are that the GNN can capture more complex interactions between vertices, which can lead to better performance on tasks that involve modeling relationships between entities in a graph. However, this also means that the network may be more sensitive to the structure of the input graph and the choice of hyperparameters, such as the width and depth of the network.\n\nThe theoretical analysis in the paper shows that the separation rank of a GNN with product aggregation is largely capped by the (L-1)-walk index of the input graph, where L is the depth of the network. This means that the network's ability to model interactions is limited by the number of walks of length L-1 that start from vertices with an edge crossing the partition (I, Ic). This provides a way to understand the expressive power of the network and how it is affected by the input graph structure and network architecture.\n\nIn summary, the choice of the AGGREGATE function in a GNN can significantly impact its ability to model interactions between vertices, and using a product aggregation operator can lead to more expressive models but may require careful tuning of hyperparameters.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[57,60,61,62,172],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

First, there are fees associated with the ADSs themselves, such as the annual ADS fee charged by the depositary bank. Additionally, there may be fees for any transactions involving the ADSs, such as the cost of transferring or selling the ADSs. These fees can reduce the overall value of the investment.\n\nCurrency conversion is another potential financial implication for an investor holding ADSs. The ADSs are denominated in U.S. dollars, while the underlying shares of the foreign company are denominated in the local currency. When the investor receives dividends or other distributions, they must convert the local currency into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. This can result in a loss if the exchange rate is unfavorable at the time of conversion. Similarly, if the investor sells the ADSs, they must convert the U.S. dollars back into the local currency at the prevailing exchange rate, which can also result in a loss if the exchange rate is unfavorable.\n\nThese fees and currency conversion costs can have a significant impact on the overall value of an investor's investment in ADSs. If the fees are high or the exchange rates are unfavorable, the investor may experience a reduction in the value of their investment. Additionally, these costs can reduce the investor's returns on investment, as they must be deducted from the dividends or other distributions received. Therefore, it is important for investors to carefully consider these potential financial implications before investing in ADSs.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[48,51,52,55,126],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The 2NMExt function takes as input the combined string A o B' and the shared secret W, and outputs a string R that is non-malleable against tampering by an active adversary Eve.\n\nThe non-malleability property ensures that if Eve tampers with the inputs A and B, the output R remains unchanged, thus preserving the secrecy of the shared secret W. This is achieved by the 2NMExt function's ability to extract a non-malleable output from the tampered inputs, even if the adversary has full control over the channel between Alice and Bob.\n\nThe protocol then splits the output R into three parts, which are exchanged between Alice and Bob to verify that they have obtained the correct output.

Therefore, you need to clone your computer's MAC address to the router to resolve this issue. The potential issue that could arise if the router's default LAN IP address conflicts with your existing modem/router is that the router will not be able to communicate with your modem, and you will not be able to access the internet. To resolve this problem, you need to change the LAN IP address of the router to avoid such conflict.

(2021), has several key differences and potential advantages compared to machine learning approaches. Firstly, white-box analysis provides a more transparent and interpretable approach to modeling performance, as it involves analyzing the code structure and architecture of the system to understand the underlying mechanisms that affect performance. This can help identify the specific configuration options that have the most significant impact on performance, which can be useful for optimizing the system.\n\nSecondly, white-box analysis can provide more accurate predictions of performance, as it takes into account the specific characteristics of the system being modeled. This can be particularly important for configurable systems, where performance can vary widely depending on the specific configuration options being used. By analyzing the code structure and architecture of the system, white-box analysis can provide a more accurate understanding of how different configuration options interact with each other and affect performance.\n\nFinally, white-box analysis can be more efficient than machine learning approaches, as it does not require large amounts of data to train the model. This can be particularly important for configurable systems, where performance data can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. By analyzing the code structure and architecture of the system, white-box analysis can provide accurate predictions of performance without requiring large amounts of data.\n\nOverall, white-box analysis over machine learning has several potential advantages for modeling the performance of configurable systems, including increased transparency, accuracy, and efficiency.

Therefore, it is likely that further increasing the batch size beyond 1000 would result in a decrease in the success rate and an increase in the tracking error and acceleration.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[65,66,67,75,94],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"In the provided diagram, the set \\( B \\) is represented by a vertical line intersecting the triangle at points \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).

The set \\( B \\) is defined by the constraint \\( \\langle E \\rangle_p = \\frac{1}{4} \\), where \\( E \\) is an energy function. The maximum entropy principle does not yield all maximal elements of \\( \\succeq_U \\) in \\( B \\), as shown by the points \\( p \\) and \\( q \\). Point \\( p \\) is a maximal element of \\( B \\), but \\( q \\) is also in \\( B \\) and has a lower entropy \\( H(q) < H(p) \\). This means that \\( p \\) is a maximal element of \\( B \\) that is not obtained via the maximum entropy principle.\n\nThe implication of this for the optimization of injective monotones in preordered spaces is that while the maximum entropy principle can be used to find some maximal elements, it may not capture all of them. This suggests that other optimization principles or methods may be necessary to find all maximal elements in a given preordered space. The existence of injective monotones allows for the representation of maximal elements, but it is important to note that these monotones may not always yield all maximal elements, especially when constrained by linear subsets of the space. This highlights the need for a more comprehensive approach to finding all maximal elements in preordered spaces, potentially involving the use of multiple optimization principles or methods.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[74,152,153,154,165],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Their positioning is important for proper oven function because they allow hot air and moisture to escape from the oven during cooking. This helps to maintain even cooking temperatures and prevent hotspots. The vents also help to cool the oven after cooking, which can improve energy efficiency and extend the life of the oven. Additionally, blocking or covering the vents can interfere with air circulation, which can affect cooking results and cause the oven to work harder and use more energy.","source":"data/test/ywge745c0fs.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[1,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,16,17,19,22,24,31,32,33,34,36,38],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How do the activation truncation techniques like ASH leverage parameter gradients to enhance OOD detection, and what is the underlying principle that explains their performance advantage?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[130],"raw_output":"","pred":"Activation Shaping (ASH) and similar activation truncation techniques leverage parameter gradients to enhance OOD detection by picking a representation for which the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters is high for many training points. This truncation effectively projects onto the gradients on parameters with the highest variation in the representation layers of the network. The underlying principle is that OOD examples tend to have different activation patterns compared to in-distribution examples. By focusing on the most informative gradients, these methods implicitly capture the key differences between OOD and in-distribution data. This allows for more effective OOD detection without explicitly using gradients for OOD. The performance advantage comes from implicitly including the training parameter space in model predictions, which helps explain the high performance of gradient-based methods.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[6,31,51,61,118,119,120,121,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,139,142,148,191],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle can lead to several safety risks, including damage to the vehicle itself, loss of control, and potential injury to passengers. The roof rack is designed to carry a specific weight, and exceeding this limit can cause the roof rack to become unstable or even detach from the vehicle, leading to loss of control and potential accidents. Additionally, the weight distribution on the roof rack can affect the vehicle's handling and stability, especially at high speeds or during sudden maneuvers.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for roof rack loading. This includes checking the maximum weight capacity of the roof rack and ensuring that all items are securely fastened and evenly distributed. It is also important to avoid carrying large, flat items that could extend higher than the roof rack's maximum height, as this can increase the risk of damage or loss of cargo. Lastly, always drive cautiously and maintain a safe speed when carrying items on the roof rack, especially on winding roads or during adverse weather conditions.","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[13,31,39,73,80,131,149,249,274,280,302,310,311,312,316,319,482,519,542,546],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What is the total amount of financial liabilities at amortized cost for the year 2023, and how does it compare to the total amount for 2022? Consider the implications of any changes in these liabilities on the company's financial strategy.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[205],"raw_output":"","pred":"The total amount of financial liabilities at amortized cost for the year 2023 was US$642,778,000, compared to US$634,633,000 for 2022. This represents an increase of approximately 1.27%. The increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost is primarily due to the increase in trade payables, lease liabilities, and borrowings. The increase in trade payables is likely due to the company's ongoing operations and the need to pay for goods and services provided by suppliers. The increase in lease liabilities is likely due to the company's lease obligations for property, plant, and equipment. The increase in borrowings is likely due to the company's need to finance its operations and capital expenditures. The increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost may have implications for the company's financial strategy, as it may indicate that the company is taking on more debt to finance its operations and growth. This could potentially increase the company's financial risk, as it may be more susceptible to interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors. However, the increase in financial liabilities may also be a sign of the company's growth and expansion, as it may be investing in new projects and expanding its operations. Overall, the increase in financial liabilities at amortized cost is a positive sign for the company's financial health, as it indicates that the company is growing and expanding its operations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_GPRK_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[23,24,27,106,107,108,116,127,170,176,180,183,186,196,198,204,205,206,210,218],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is done by setting any activations below a certain percentile to zero, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the representation. The underlying principle that explains their performance advantage is that by selectively pruning activations, the network is forced to focus on the most important features for classification, which can improve its ability to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. This is because OOD data often contains features that are not present in the training data, and by pruning activations, the network is able to reduce the impact of these irrelevant features on its predictions. Additionally, by using parameter gradients to determine the percentile threshold for pruning, the technique can adapt to the specific characteristics of the model and the data it is being applied to, further improving its performance.","source":"data/test/2407.11029.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[130],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 3\n","score":3}]}

While (X × X)-TE requires that a function π be equivariant with respect to all translations on X × X, DTE only requires that π be equivariant with respect to translations along the diagonal of X × X. This means that DTE functions are more general than (X × X)-TE functions, and the class of DTE functions is larger than the class of (X × X)-TE functions.\n\nThe significance of duplicating inputs in the context of proving Theorem 4.9 is that it allows us to apply Theorem 4.8 with X × X as the space of inputs. However, to do this, we need πdup to be (X × X)-translation equivariant. Unfortunately, (4.31) says that πdup is only equivariant with respect to translations along the diagonal of X × X. This motivates the general definition of diagonal translation equivariance.\n\nTo prove Theorem 4.9, we need to show that πdup is (X × X)-translation equivariant. We can do this by defining what happens for non-diagonal translations using (4.34). This almost works, but there is a problem: (4.34) might clash with the original definition of π. However, this problem can be circumvented by considering a topological (X × X)-translation space C and using the fact that the group of diagonal translations is a subgroup of the group of (X × X)-translations.","source":"data/test/2408.09583.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[83],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This function is a strong non-malleable extractor, which means it can extract a secret key from the shared secret W and the random variables A1 and A2, even if the adversary has tampered with the shared secret and the random variables.\n\nThe protocol works as follows: Alice and Bob each perform a 2NMExt operation on their respective inputs (W, A1, A2) and (W, B1, B2), respectively. They then compare the outputs of these operations. If the outputs match, they proceed to extract a shared secret S1 and S2, which are used to generate MACs σA and σB. These MACs are then used to verify the integrity of the shared secret and the random variables. If the verification is successful, the protocol outputs the shared secret SExt(W, A2 + B2).\n\nThe 2NMExt function ensures the security of the shared secret by extracting a secret key from the tampered shared secret and the random variables, even if the adversary has tampered with them. This is achieved by using a strong non-malleable extractor, which is designed to be resistant to tampering attacks. The protocol also includes a verification step, which checks the integrity of the shared secret and the random variables. If the verification fails, the protocol aborts, ensuring that the shared secret is not compromised.\n\nIn summary, the 2NMExt function is a critical component of the privacy amplification protocol, as it ensures the security of the shared secret between Alice and Bob, even in the presence of an active adversary.","source":"data/test/2406.16313.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[106],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Explain why cloning your computer's MAC address to your router might be necessary when using a cable modem for internet access, and describe the potential issue that could arise if the router's default LAN IP address conflicts with your existing modem/router.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[105],"raw_output":"","pred":"Cloning your computer's MAC address to your router is necessary when using a cable modem for internet access because some ISPs register the MAC address of your computer when you access the internet for the first time through their cable modem. If you add a router into your network to share your internet connection, the ISP will not accept it as the MAC address is changed. To resolve this issue, you need to clone your computer's MAC address to the router. This ensures that the ISP recognizes the router as a legitimate device and allows you to access the internet.\n\nThe potential issue that could arise if the router's default LAN IP address conflicts with your existing modem/router is that the router will not be able to communicate with your modem and you will not be able to access the internet. This is because most TP-Link routers use 192.168.0.1/192.168.1.1 as their default LAN IP address, which may conflict with the IP range of your existing ADSL modem/router. To resolve this problem, you need to change the LAN IP address of the router to avoid such conflict. This can be done by visiting the TP-Link router's web interface, going to the Advanced > Network > LAN section, and modifying the LAN IP address as shown in the provided picture.","source":"data/test/archer_ax21.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[105],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This is suggested by the fact that the models in Tasks 7 and 8 have the smallest variation in test accuracy, yet the constrained margin has the highest CMI for Task 8 and the second highest for Task 7. This suggests that these tasks are inherently difficult when it comes to generalization prediction. Despite this limitation, the resulting scatter plots of mean constrained margin versus test accuracy for all three of these tasks do not show points in the lower right (large margin but low generalization) or upper left (small margin but high generalization) quadrants. It is therefore possible that a larger mean constrained margin is always beneficial to a model's generalization, even though it is not always fully descriptive of its performance. This relates to the field of adversarial examples because the existence of adversarial examples is an open problem in the field of adversarial machine learning. Many hypotheses have been put forward, but the question remains mostly unanswered after a decade of research. The high linearity of DNNs is attributed to the existence of adversarial examples, and the success of the very simple fast-gradient sign method (FGSM) for generating adversarial examples is motivated by the linearity of the model.","source":"data/test/2405.17445.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[123],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The point \\( p \\) is a maximal element in \\( B \\), and \\( q \\) is also a maximal element in \\( B \\). However, \\( q \\) is not obtained via the maximum entropy principle because \\( \\argmax_B H = \\{p\\} \\). This means that the maximum entropy principle does not yield all maximal elements of \\( B \\) in this case.\n\nThe implications of this for the optimization of injective monotones in preordered spaces are significant. The maximum entropy principle is a powerful tool for optimizing injective monotones, but it is not always sufficient to obtain all maximal elements of a preordered space. In this case, the maximum entropy principle only yields the maximal element \\( p \\), while \\( q \\) is also a maximal element in \\( B \\). This suggests that there may be other optimization techniques or methods that can be used to obtain all maximal elements of a preordered space, even when the maximum entropy principle is not sufficient.\n\nFurthermore, this example highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of optimization techniques and the need to explore alternative methods when necessary. It also emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the properties of a preordered space and the constraints that may affect the optimization process. In conclusion, this example demonstrates that the maximum entropy principle is not always sufficient to obtain all maximal elements of a preordered space, and that alternative optimization techniques may be necessary to obtain all maximal elements.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"qwen","retrieved_pages":[154],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Explain how the different types of sensors (propagation, update, and joint sensors) contribute to the navigation and state estimation of a heterogeneous swarm of agents, as depicted in the provided figure. Discuss the potential challenges and benefits of integrating these sensors in a distributed multi-agent system.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[24],"raw_output":"","pred":"The figure illustrates a heterogeneous swarm of agents equipped with various types of sensors to enhance navigation and state estimation. Propagation sensors, such as IMUs, provide basic motion data, enabling agents to estimate their own movement. Update sensors, including cameras, GNSS, magnetometers, and barometers, offer more refined measurements to correct and refine the initial estimates. Joint sensors, like relative pose and range/bearing, allow agents to share information about their positions relative to each other, further improving the accuracy of the overall state estimation.\n\nThe integration of these sensors in a distributed multi-agent system offers several benefits. Propagation sensors ensure that each agent can maintain a basic understanding of its own movement, which is crucial for navigation. Update sensors provide additional data points that can be used to correct errors in the initial estimates, leading to more accurate state estimation. Joint sensors enable agents to coordinate their movements and positions, which is essential for tasks requiring precise spatial awareness.\n\nHowever, challenges arise from the heterogeneity of the swarm. Different agents may have varying sensor configurations, which can lead to inconsistencies in data collection and processing. Additionally, the integration of these sensors requires careful coordination and communication among agents, which can be complex in a distributed system. Ensuring that all agents can effectively share and process sensor data is crucial for the overall success of the mission.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[24,89,99,101,146,100,111,75,182,97,79,149,95,16,17,74,105,114,76,108,162,9,102,5,93,106,178,77,104,151,145,160,177,83,96,179,194,201,20,128,192,203,205,110,193,195,18,23,82,180,183,21,72,124,204,88,196,15,19,98,152,14,28,113,132,115,150,166,86,197,122,121,131,148,206,223,10,22,107,116,123,212,94,184,202,221,81,191,207,215,130,199,85,214,210,158,11,84,134,157,181,198,109,117,164,6,147,90,161,185,190,25,87,13,126,133,220,125,53,42,208,209,218,29,59,73,217,222,50,159,155,127,129,156,211,8,142,143,189,216,48,119,213,63,120,153,174,154,118,35,200,169,188,46,78,27,69,43,45,55,144,70,103,80,4,31,49,26,165,57,186,224,32,71,1,64,163,44,54,60,141,219,92,68,112,30,40,187,36,39,139,167,140,33,37,47,137,67,62,91,136,225,34,41,58,51,56,138,172,168,38,52,65,170,66,171,135,175,3,176,61,173,12,7,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

It is straightforward and intuitive, but it does not account for the covariance structure of the data. This means that Euclidean distance treats all dimensions equally, regardless of their variability or correlation.\n\nMahalanobis distance, on the other hand, is defined as \\( d_M(p, x) = \\sqrt{(p - x)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (p - x)} \\), where \\( \\Sigma \\) is the covariance matrix of the distribution. This distance measure takes into account the covariance structure of the data, effectively scaling the distance based on the variability and correlation of the dimensions. This makes Mahalanobis distance more appropriate when dealing with data that has varying scales or correlated features, as it provides a more accurate measure of how far a point is from the distribution.\n\nIn the context of estimation error, Mahalanobis distance is particularly useful when the error distribution is not spherical (i.e., when the variances and covariances are not equal). It provides a more nuanced measure of error by considering the shape and orientation of the error distribution, which can be crucial in applications where the error is not uniformly distributed or where the dimensions are not independent.","source":"data/test/2408.12360.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[38,4,39,37,20,34,42,119,186,54,66,58,40,41,67,64,209,108,138,169,191,32,132,176,222,154,141,36,49,68,211,219,216,18,47,56,60,129,220,17,208,50,53,223,122,142,198,57,62,193,224,22,192,82,111,35,45,48,55,155,130,200,26,52,63,106,115,163,19,61,104,214,215,31,43,51,78,124,133,206,10,75,105,121,197,44,87,147,173,175,217,5,9,14,99,46,116,164,93,178,196,221,23,29,71,123,162,166,190,194,225,98,128,131,69,114,65,134,143,158,177,195,210,15,24,27,81,107,136,205,145,161,140,165,168,33,74,79,109,120,127,137,156,167,76,96,157,203,21,89,97,117,170,8,80,103,148,150,179,149,181,16,110,139,187,212,70,83,144,218,86,118,184,185,199,207,73,102,146,174,180,202,77,113,213,59,94,100,171,201,11,135,6,91,25,95,182,72,84,126,152,183,88,112,159,172,101,13,90,30,160,3,151,153,204,1,92,28,85,125,189,2,12,188,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What insight can be drawn from the relative frequencies of binary operators compared to unary operators in the symbolic loss functions discovered by EvoMAL, and how might this inform future improvements to the algorithm's search space or efficiency?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[77],"raw_output":"","pred":"The bar chart in Figure 3.7 reveals that binary operators (subtraction, multiplication, division, minimum, maximum, and AQ) are significantly more prevalent in the symbolic loss functions discovered by EvoMAL compared to unary operators (sign, square, absolute, logarithm, square root, and tanh). Specifically, binary operators account for 87.5% of the total operations, while unary operators make up only 12.5%.\n\nThis insight suggests that binary operators are more fundamental and versatile in constructing loss functions. They are likely more effective at capturing the essential relationships between predictions and ground truth across different tasks and datasets. The high frequency of binary operators indicates that EvoMAL's search space is well-suited for discovering loss functions that can generalize well across various tasks.\n\nFuture improvements to the algorithm's search space or efficiency could involve further refining the binary operator set to better capture the nuances of different tasks. For example, adding more specific binary operators that address common loss function structures could enhance the algorithm's ability to discover optimal loss functions. Additionally, exploring ways to reduce the frequency of unary operators, which are less common in the discovered loss functions, might lead to more efficient and effective loss function discovery. This could involve modifying the evolutionary process to favor binary operators or adjusting the fitness function to better reward the use of binary operators.","source":"data/test/2406.09713.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[77,159,52,70,53,74,76,79,80,49,78,84,54,3,158,64,160,61,66,81,51,67,105,85,56,72,163,22,57,63,91,55,82,73,44,68,83,65,45,47,71,93,157,75,46,69,17,50,8,175,37,131,21,168,171,164,169,165,154,12,119,170,180,167,178,36,176,145,150,59,144,151,129,130,10,38,116,181,15,23,172,86,60,101,179,161,166,34,62,182,134,141,173,98,40,106,122,162,30,126,133,136,32,88,96,107,117,123,42,137,140,155,177,41,58,109,19,26,132,152,16,25,124,31,104,127,174,5,94,113,13,39,143,20,27,29,102,108,142,128,111,135,138,28,87,110,146,7,95,99,103,9,147,100,148,33,115,118,149,120,121,11,14,139,90,97,153,18,35,92,43,112,6,114,125,1,48,4,89,2,156,24],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The penultimate layer representations of AlexNet on CIFAR-10, using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, show that both the cross-entropy loss and the absolute cross-entropy loss with ϕ1 = 1 yield representations with visually similar inter-class separations. This similarity suggests that these loss functions produce representations that are effective in distinguishing between different classes, which is crucial for good generalization performance.\n\nLabel smoothing regularization with ξ = 0.1 and absolute cross-entropy loss with ϕ1 = 1.1 also demonstrate improved inter-class separations and tighter intra-class representations compared to the cross-entropy loss. This indicates that both label smoothing and the absolute cross-entropy loss with a higher ϕ1 value can enhance the discriminative power of the learned representations, leading to better generalization.\n\nThe visual analysis supports the theoretical findings that label smoothing regularization and the absolute cross-entropy loss with ϕ1 > 1 can lead to more robust and discriminative representations. This improved inter-class separation is likely to contribute to better generalization performance, as the model can more accurately distinguish between different classes, even when faced with novel or unseen data.","source":"data/test/2406.09713.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[95,94,101,103,102,104,93,84,80,151,70,158,77,105,10,163,9,91,131,69,88,8,96,159,161,162,68,79,160,126,157,173,61,83,128,174,37,39,124,168,38,127,130,176,48,49,81,106,110,118,150,182,15,31,34,51,140,171,14,16,71,119,136,147,97,133,134,145,149,152,29,57,59,99,109,155,164,179,100,115,175,17,86,90,137,144,170,178,74,85,117,142,30,40,52,73,87,98,167,177,50,132,141,6,19,23,108,120,125,153,154,181,20,33,122,129,148,7,32,43,65,67,76,82,112,63,72,113,143,13,46,54,92,180,4,42,55,60,78,121,166,172,3,45,89,123,22,27,62,66,35,53,64,116,165,12,21,28,36,2,47,169,18,56,111,114,11,26,138,25,44,146,135,139,75,107,41,58,156,24,5,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is crucial because unprotected division operations can lead to undefined or imaginary outputs, violating the GP closure property. By replacing division with AQ, EvoMAL ensures that all evolved loss functions remain valid and computable, even when applied to a wide range of tasks and models.\n\nCompared to the traditional division operator, the AQ operator offers several advantages in the context of loss function discovery. Firstly, it maintains the GP closure property, ensuring that the evolved loss functions are well-defined and can be reliably used in the meta-learning process. Secondly, the AQ operator is more robust to numerical issues, such as division by zero, which can occur in real-world datasets. This robustness enhances the stability and reliability of the evolved loss functions. Lastly, the AQ operator allows for more efficient and accurate differentiation, which is essential for the optimization process in EvoMAL. Overall, the AQ operator facilitates the discovery of more effective and generalizable loss functions, making EvoMAL a powerful tool for meta-learning.","source":"data/test/2406.09713.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[53,52,57,176,159,61,74,77,64,158,49,54,79,55,51,91,71,45,84,22,67,70,76,160,63,3,105,65,78,56,80,59,69,85,66,82,44,81,157,72,163,75,173,47,175,8,36,46,58,181,68,34,93,37,62,73,17,83,131,180,182,40,165,171,15,117,145,164,166,21,96,115,132,154,167,98,168,169,177,7,13,116,161,170,172,35,42,107,109,140,138,141,174,179,32,50,122,12,23,123,143,151,86,106,113,136,19,20,30,60,5,99,119,134,155,178,10,18,28,87,29,124,25,41,43,88,89,130,148,150,110,111,144,90,92,133,137,16,31,100,101,118,128,142,149,27,95,129,152,162,1,38,39,33,108,139,14,97,126,112,114,9,127,135,6,94,120,26,102,146,153,125,11,104,4,121,147,48,2,103,24,156],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"Given the provided diagram and information about zig-zag strategies, explain how the concept of a minimum manipulation budget (τ) could influence the feasibility of a zig-zag strategy for an agent attempting to pass both classifiers.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[124],"raw_output":"","pred":"The minimum manipulation budget (τ) significantly influences the feasibility of a zig-zag strategy for an agent attempting to pass both classifiers.  A smaller τ restricts the agent's ability to manipulate features, making it more challenging to zig-zag between classifiers.  The zig-zag strategy involves two main steps: first, manipulating to pass the first classifier, then manipulating again to pass the second.  With a small τ, the agent may not have enough budget to make the necessary adjustments for both manipulations.\n\nFor example, if τ is very small, the agent might only be able to make a minimal adjustment to pass the first classifier.  This adjustment might not be sufficient to then pass the second classifier without further manipulation.  Consequently, the agent would likely need to make a larger adjustment in the second step, potentially exceeding τ and thus failing to pass both classifiers.\n\nIn contrast, a larger τ allows for more extensive manipulation, making it easier to zig-zag between classifiers.  The agent can make significant adjustments in the first step to pass the first classifier, then make another substantial adjustment in the second step to pass the second classifier.  This larger budget increases the likelihood of successfully zig-zagging between the classifiers.\n\nTherefore, the minimum manipulation budget directly impacts the feasibility of a zig-zag strategy, with smaller budgets making the strategy less viable and larger budgets increasing its feasibility.","source":"data/test/2408.16040.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[138,124,125,132,135,131,130,140,142,146,129,150,7,136,141,126,149,122,139,145,128,123,134,147,133,137,170,143,144,62,160,13,27,67,151,12,166,53,127,187,68,161,184,188,15,35,108,152,33,156,190,194,59,75,148,157,164,168,169,20,101,29,39,40,155,14,19,26,85,100,153,31,50,66,87,96,106,25,34,58,60,81,88,183,9,32,43,158,176,180,192,11,21,23,41,49,57,80,83,115,178,38,48,63,79,109,17,28,98,165,191,51,61,64,103,167,2,30,78,154,181,69,76,82,120,159,163,104,114,116,171,93,107,182,186,24,99,162,175,179,70,84,97,6,10,18,42,89,91,95,105,113,177,16,47,56,119,193,195,8,52,110,111,112,77,117,46,71,73,74,86,94,102,92,185,189,22,65,90,121,174,45,118,173,36,55,172,37,72,44,5,3,4,54,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is because Demographic Parity requires the classifier to classify more negatives from Group B as positives, which leads to a higher false positive rate and thus lower accuracy for Group B.\n\nIn contrast, the accuracy of Group B under the Equal Opportunity and Equalized Odds constraints remains relatively stable. Equal Opportunity aims to achieve the same true positive rate for both groups, while Equalized Odds seeks to balance false positive and false negative rates. As the probability of positives from Group B increases, these constraints allow the classifier to focus more on Group B, leading to higher accuracy for Group B without significantly impacting the accuracy of Group A.\n\nThe implications of these observations are significant for fairness-aware classifiers. Demographic Parity, while ensuring equal representation, can lead to suboptimal performance for Group B, especially when the data is biased against it. Equal Opportunity and Equalized Odds, on the other hand, provide a more nuanced approach by balancing the trade-offs between groups, potentially leading to better overall performance and fairness.

They aim to provide a robust framework for designing and monitoring screening processes that are both fair and resilient to strategic manipulation.","source":"data/test/2408.16040.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,11,13,141,7,122,183,185,104,105,179,191,84,5,81,86,119,194,190,60,184,83,186,192,8,15,127,182,102,128,152,66,89,125,18,85,139,12,103,123,187,189,88,91,69,96,188,126,138,51,100,41,129,47,106,193,56,80,67,90,116,40,82,93,120,10,25,59,114,115,142,49,97,2,180,14,99,92,50,52,107,57,58,87,42,124,133,146,101,53,62,68,30,31,32,94,54,55,155,181,16,21,140,23,61,79,17,24,130,150,154,195,151,44,63,65,95,137,98,1,45,74,76,135,27,38,156,165,29,26,174,108,163,170,166,4,149,159,169,37,173,28,117,160,171,36,73,77,134,136,157,9,71,110,132,144,164,19,20,153,177,48,143,158,175,43,64,147,35,131,33,46,168,39,70,75,145,148,112,121,176,78,178,161,109,3,34,167,162,72,111,118,172,22,113],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

More anchors provide a richer set of data points to estimate the transformation, leading to more accurate translations and, consequently, lower reconstruction errors.

{"question":"What can be inferred about the relationship between the rate of transaction issuance and the rate of block mining in the Bitcoin blockchain, and how does this relate to the concept of contention transparency?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[37],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between the rate of transaction issuance and the rate of block mining in the Bitcoin blockchain is characterized by a significant disparity. As depicted in Figure 2.2(a), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for both the number of blocks mined and the number of transactions issued shows a steep increase over time. However, the rate of transaction issuance far exceeds the rate of block mining. This disparity indicates that the blockchain is experiencing high levels of congestion, where the number of transactions waiting to be included in a block is much higher than the number of blocks being mined.\n\nThis high level of congestion directly impacts the concept of contention transparency. Contention transparency refers to the assumption that all transactions are publicly broadcasted and available to all miners, allowing for a uniform view of the available transactions. However, in the Bitcoin blockchain, the high rate of transaction issuance and the limited rate of block mining create a situation where not all transactions are publicly visible. Miners may have access to a subset of transactions that are not broadcast to the public, leading to a non-uniform view of the available transactions. This lack of transparency can result in miners having different views of the Mempool, which is the pool of unconfirmed transactions that miners consider when selecting transactions to include in a block. Consequently, the prioritization of transactions becomes less transparent, as miners may prioritize transactions based on private information that is not accessible to other miners. This non-uniformity in transaction visibility can lead to inefficiencies and potential unfairness in the prioritization of transactions.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,109,34,29,107,13,14,48,69,82,49,73,127,113,126,25,125,64,76,145,71,85,6,114,70,75,108,116,26,63,83,124,32,47,12,16,27,46,72,11,68,19,87,15,21,66,28,38,78,84,123,24,51,118,42,50,60,112,120,33,77,36,122,22,79,20,52,111,17,53,90,99,147,43,74,45,58,104,106,110,121,115,119,4,57,44,86,30,55,62,91,5,54,65,130,39,88,41,67,81,139,93,35,96,98,143,56,59,80,136,146,94,142,149,95,144,105,135,89,141,97,129,103,131,40,61,101,148,92,102,18,150,31,140,7,138,100,137,151,133,128,134,23,132,1,9,117,2,3,8,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This high concentration of power raises significant concerns about the potential for mining pool collusion and centralization in the Bitcoin network.\n\nFirstly, with such a high combined hash rate, these pools could potentially collude to include or exclude transactions, thereby gaining substantial control over the blockchain. This centralization threat could undermine the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, which is a core principle of the network. Centralized control could lead to censorship, where certain transactions or users are systematically excluded from the network, potentially leading to a loss of privacy and freedom.\n\nSecondly, the lack of transparency in their queue management and prioritization of transactions could allow these pools to charge higher prices for their acceleration services. This could create a market where users pay more to ensure their transactions are included faster, potentially leading to a two-tier system where those who can afford to pay more have priority over others.\n\nOverall, this concentration of power and potential for collusion could erode the trust and security of the Bitcoin network, making it more vulnerable to attacks and manipulation.

{"question":"How do transaction fee rates correlate with Mempool congestion levels and transaction commit delays, and what strategies do users employ to mitigate delays during high congestion periods?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[120],"raw_output":"","pred":"Transaction fee rates are inversely correlated with Mempool congestion levels and directly correlated with transaction commit delays.  As Mempool congestion increases, users raise their transaction fee rates to incentivize miners to prioritize their transactions for inclusion in the next block.  This strategy effectively reduces commit delays, as higher fee rates are rewarded with faster inclusion times.\n\nThe correlation between fee rates and congestion is evident in Figure 3.3c, which shows that fee rates are strictly higher for higher congestion levels.  Figure 3.4 further illustrates this relationship by comparing the CDF of commit delays for transactions with different fee rates in data set A.  Transactions with higher fee rates experience significantly shorter commit delays compared to those with lower fee rates.\n\nUsers employ this strategy by increasing their transaction fees during periods of high Mempool congestion.  This incentivizes miners to prioritize their transactions, thereby reducing the time it takes for transactions to be confirmed and included in the blockchain.  The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated in Figure 3.4, which shows that higher fee rates consistently result in shorter commit delays.

{"question":"How does the use of the OP_Return opcode in Bitcoin transactions, particularly those associated with the Omni Layer Protocol, create challenges in assessing the true value of transactions and potentially exacerbate issues related to transaction fee opacity and fairness?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[65],"raw_output":"","pred":"The use of the OP_Return opcode in Bitcoin transactions, especially those associated with the Omni Layer Protocol, introduces challenges in assessing the true value of transactions. This is because the arbitrary data stored within these transactions can obscure the actual value transferred. The protocol specification from Omni Layer (2020) provides a data format for this arbitrary data, which can be parsed to reveal the true value. However, this requires interpreting the data, which can be complex and time-consuming.\n\nThis opacity of transaction values exacerbates issues related to transaction fee fairness. Miners, who prioritize transactions based on fees, might inadvertently prioritize transactions with higher fees but lower true values, leading to a misalignment between the fees paid and the actual value transferred. This can result in unfairness, where transactions with higher fees but lower true values are given priority over those with lower fees but higher true values.\n\nFurthermore, the use of the OP_Return opcode in transactions associated with the Omni Layer Protocol, which often involve stablecoins like Tether USDT, can further complicate the assessment of transaction values. The high frequency of these transactions, averaging 111 per block, can overwhelm the parsing process, making it difficult to accurately assess the true value of each transaction.\n\nOverall, the use of the OP_Return opcode in Bitcoin transactions, particularly those associated with the Omni Layer Protocol, creates challenges in assessing the true value of transactions, potentially exacerbating issues related to transaction fee opacity and fairness.","source":"data/test/2405.18876.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[66,65,41,146,68,17,67,149,76,25,114,27,26,113,28,69,116,52,64,82,108,30,47,109,36,29,90,112,135,37,78,79,150,31,107,143,147,32,46,49,54,140,57,122,14,19,60,83,139,16,39,87,34,42,63,80,22,43,51,126,130,136,148,15,45,74,96,137,50,59,142,4,55,56,84,91,118,72,81,85,92,106,115,123,125,35,48,53,71,111,21,99,145,5,6,97,120,38,62,70,88,94,131,144,61,75,119,121,127,138,103,124,12,89,24,44,73,141,13,105,20,40,77,98,33,58,93,104,1,11,95,100,110,18,151,102,7,101,132,86,9,128,129,23,2,10,133,134,8,3,117],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

S′ is constructed to track the last letter of a word, and λ′ is defined to compute the output based on the behavior of the prefix, suffix, and input letter.

{"question":"Here's a challenging question based on the target texts:\n\nHow does the concept of orbit-finiteness relate to classical finiteness, and what implications does this have for sets with atoms? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[25],"raw_output":"","pred":"Orbit-finiteness is a concept that relates to classical finiteness in a nuanced way for sets with atoms. While classical finiteness simply counts the number of elements in a set, orbit-finiteness considers the structure of the set under permutations of atoms.\n\nFor example, consider the set of all 3-tuples of atoms (A^3). This set is orbit-finite because it has only finitely many orbits under atom permutations. Each orbit corresponds to a distinct equality pattern among the atoms. For instance, one orbit might consist of tuples where all atoms are equal, another where the first and third atoms are equal, and so on.\n\nHowever, orbit-finiteness does not preserve under powersets or function spaces. For instance, the powerset of A^3 (P(A^3)) is orbit-infinite, even though A^3 itself is orbit-finite. Similarly, the set of finitely supported functions from A to {yes, no} is also orbit-infinite.\n\nThis means that while orbit-finiteness captures some aspects of classical finiteness, it is not a direct equivalent. It allows for a more fine-grained analysis of sets with atoms, but it does not fully align with classical finiteness in all cases. This distinction is important for understanding the behavior of sets with atoms under various operations and transformations.","source":"data/test/2406.18934.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[26,25,102,215,116,66,51,59,28,88,52,94,34,49,85,173,29,70,119,46,48,86,103,27,110,152,153,44,100,60,3,129,10,65,89,115,53,105,41,45,84,2,124,128,30,43,79,76,114,126,159,182,123,99,220,15,35,11,193,64,90,97,20,23,36,138,37,157,175,185,31,68,21,132,187,127,137,184,183,58,80,146,147,149,181,67,139,71,112,177,69,83,120,24,50,208,216,22,148,96,205,151,219,77,179,217,61,155,98,178,214,39,95,204,125,140,154,9,12,33,38,172,211,101,218,13,170,47,87,93,180,156,176,32,54,111,130,189,210,160,171,117,141,162,7,91,122,150,209,40,16,161,113,212,78,121,191,207,14,57,158,166,168,213,104,134,135,163,164,92,131,169,62,142,107,109,196,81,145,165,194,203,19,42,63,8,167,186,202,6,56,82,106,144,199,198,1,133,190,17,174,195,201,4,108,143,197,18,5,74,136,192,200,72,188,206,55,75,118,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is important for parsing the sentence and understanding the roles of each word within the grammatical structure. For example, the word \"का\" (ka) in the nominative case could be the subject of the verb \"रहते\" (rahate), indicating that \"का\" is the agent performing the action described by \"रहते\".

This is because the system lacks the ability to understand the meaning of the text, only focusing on the metrical structure.\n\n2. **Sandhi Issues**: Errors arising from the presence of whitespace in the text, which can alter the number of syllables and thus the meter, are not always detected. The system ignores spaces while computing the metrical signature, which can lead to incorrect identification.\n\n3. **OCR Accuracy**: The performance of the OCR system significantly impacts the error rate. Poor OCR quality can introduce numerous errors, making it difficult for the meter identification system to accurately identify the correct meter.\n\n4. **False Positives**: The system may identify errors that are not actually present in the text, leading to unnecessary corrections. This is more likely with OCR systems that make numerous errors, as the system may incorrectly identify the closest match to the erroneous signature.\n\n5. **Contextual Understanding**: The system's inability to understand the context of the text means it cannot always determine the correct meter, even if the text is syntactically correct.\n\nThese limitations highlight the need for more sophisticated systems that can incorporate semantic understanding and context to improve the accuracy of meter identification in Sanskrit texts.","source":"data/test/2406.18276.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,175,26,157,156,154,166,174,22,172,49,171,9,44,81,155,74,80,201,107,37,73,153,193,194,108,158,159,173,29,48,78,104,103,169,18,75,162,163,77,25,56,72,76,95,167,202,33,149,195,71,119,164,203,41,79,84,100,39,53,59,83,170,34,28,35,192,58,200,8,43,60,62,147,165,204,32,57,96,36,141,10,19,42,47,54,105,123,124,161,180,52,70,140,51,55,109,7,40,45,64,85,115,185,186,92,118,82,184,143,148,177,190,3,23,46,97,101,138,20,111,120,125,129,191,98,130,160,1,65,66,112,127,181,199,106,122,27,61,68,113,151,197,198,114,150,152,178,179,5,12,17,88,126,133,189,67,131,182,183,137,142,15,69,187,99,102,117,139,145,146,188,136,110,89,134,31,63,121,21,144,86,116,87,132,93,90,38,168,94,91,13,135,11,14,2,4,6,16,24,30,50,128,196],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Each chapter is represented as a JSON file, which contains the text and optional extra information such as word segmentation, verse ID, and linguistic information. This information is then organized into a hierarchical structure, with each level providing a more detailed view of the text.\n\nTo manage this hierarchical structure, the system uses a relational database compatible with SQLAlchemy, such as SQLite. This database is used to store the linguistic information, including lemmas, entity types, line numbers, and user IDs of annotators. Additionally, a separate table stores lemmas, which are referenced in entity and relationship annotations.\n\nFor querying the linguistic information, the system employs Neo4j as the graph database server. This allows for the storage and querying of the knowledge graph (KG) independently of the relational database. Cypher, the query language for Neo4j, is used to query the graph database and produce results.

This ordering is crucial for understanding the concept of d-disorder, which is a measure of how close a distribution is to a reference distribution d.\n\nThe significance of this arrangement is that it allows us to visualize and analyze the relationships between different distributions in terms of their proximity to d.

The triangular space provides a compact and intuitive way to represent these transformations and relationships, making it easier to study the properties of d-majorization and its implications for the study of order isomorphisms and second laws of disorder.","source":"data/test/2406.10730.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[80,284,283,285,257,279,277,278,276,79,286,244,282,54,189,280,242,248,288,287,211,266,64,281,336,61,81,292,13,59,95,116,256,222,289,78,339,77,252,320,49,263,48,71,76,117,118,268,245,2,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,18,22,32,45,46,60,84,110,128,142,144,233,240,55,82,138,186,208,178,231,265,267,291,63,146,205,249,68,132,62,73,114,272,299,56,58,154,158,273,52,53,74,103,212,258,214,333,161,183,29,67,75,121,199,216,269,21,34,125,348,353,72,85,93,119,218,355,362,66,213,89,113,134,148,290,309,43,123,177,217,243,255,19,127,135,137,206,226,262,369,26,129,179,190,201,228,229,334,6,27,30,105,295,335,337,344,57,195,200,41,102,225,342,343,347,363,31,96,207,215,327,24,50,108,175,181,191,39,94,126,236,261,130,139,197,210,301,302,326,361,38,51,112,140,149,159,264,151,324,331,37,104,162,163,193,198,224,322,40,107,184,204,230,232,234,235,247,294,303,92,120,136,152,188,315,316,332,341,28,69,221,296,298,346,5,97,124,131,237,250,253,328,35,223,260,349,367,9,164,270,319,321,330,352,360,368,14,20,165,172,318,345,356,358,25,36,99,338,340,42,47,122,170,173,185,238,297,311,351,169,251,300,305,325,350,1,70,91,171,271,354,90,100,275,98,155,192,307,310,147,153,160,219,259,304,359,88,133,166,209,246,317,293,323,101,141,176,182,227,308,312,115,220,241,314,10,106,33,86,167,187,254,23,87,150,180,313,194,196,329,65,370,44,83,357,111,157,168,174,145,274,202,366,156,203,17,364,239,306,365,3,109,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}]}

As time progresses, the total number of shares increases, but the rate of increase slows down, indicating that the growth in current shares is being offset by the diminishing returns from additional forwards. This pattern is typical of content propagation on social networks, where initial enthusiasm and active sharing lead to rapid growth, but as the content reaches a broader audience, the rate of new shares slows down due to saturation effects and diminishing returns on additional forwards.\n\nThe graph also shows that the \"Current Shares\" curve eventually levels off, while the \"Total Shares\" curve continues to rise but at a much slower rate. This leveling off of the \"Current Shares\" curve indicates that the content has reached a point where it is no longer being actively shared by new users, suggesting that the saturation point has been reached.","source":"data/test/2406.08594.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[131,142,140,141,132,139,133,143,165,138,137,72,101,19,128,87,91,100,130,85,73,166,84,144,164,123,7,216,76,129,124,136,26,77,17,83,108,80,96,54,86,135,23,30,47,18,92,127,21,215,11,22,74,179,29,217,118,163,168,12,31,60,219,88,8,20,41,52,75,94,149,218,53,68,27,146,59,79,2,4,125,157,148,194,14,25,56,58,10,16,28,48,51,81,90,55,109,159,98,150,153,89,107,213,115,120,122,152,161,178,9,71,151,155,212,220,57,82,95,214,36,49,67,103,121,38,46,93,126,145,198,5,15,33,102,112,110,111,162,167,173,114,222,176,200,65,208,35,50,183,196,66,113,185,62,104,184,156,97,69,154,170,172,187,193,117,211,174,175,203,204,119,158,206,42,70,181,64,116,221,37,186,207,106,39,147,160,24,40,78,202,1,43,201,210,105,188,205,190,209,99,171,180,182,195,197,177,134,169,192,34,199,63,32,45,191,44,3,61,189,13,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This indicates that the GPU implementation is significantly faster, especially for larger batch sizes.\n\nThe implications for choosing one over the other are significant. The GPU implementation offers better scalability and efficiency, especially for larger batch sizes, due to its ability to handle parallel computations effectively. This makes it more suitable for scenarios requiring high computational throughput and large data sets. However, the GPU implementation might face resource competition, as GPUs are often used for other tasks requiring high computational power.

It can be a better choice for smaller batch sizes or when dedicated GPU resources are not available. However, for larger batch sizes, the performance gap between the two implementations becomes more pronounced, making the GPU implementation the preferred choice for efficiency and scalability.","source":"data/test/2408.10731.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[67,75,66,12,94,90,93,48,10,55,56,65,82,19,81,91,46,86,11,6,92,95,52,77,83,50,18,64,98,44,38,49,32,34,54,70,104,53,76,30,57,14,85,20,43,63,35,36,87,96,47,29,69,100,37,60,61,78,101,8,42,26,79,107,33,88,106,15,45,102,103,72,105,25,89,31,17,7,71,80,59,2,27,68,24,28,16,84,41,62,99,73,13,39,58,74,109,23,112,40,4,111,97,110,22,51,108,21,3,1,9,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Uniqueness refers to the absence of duplicate records within a dataset, ensuring that each record is distinct and not a repetition of another. Consistency, on the other hand, pertains to the coherence and agreement of data across multiple records that refer to the same entity. Essentially, a dataset can be considered consistent if it maintains the same information about an entity across different records.\n\nThe relationship between these two concepts is that achieving high Uniqueness often necessitates high Consistency. For instance, if a dataset has high Uniqueness, it implies that each record is unique, and thus, the information about each entity is consistent across different records. Conversely, if a dataset has high Consistency, it suggests that the same entity is represented consistently across records, which indirectly supports high Uniqueness.\n\nHowever, achieving both simultaneously can be challenging in large datasets. The primary challenge lies in identifying and resolving inconsistencies while ensuring that no duplicates exist. This requires sophisticated algorithms and data cleaning techniques to detect and correct inconsistencies without introducing new duplicates.

This process is computationally expensive due to the large transformation matrices and the iterative nature of the routing algorithm. The iterative nature of routing makes it particularly beneficial for small-sized networks, where the computational cost is manageable. However, for larger networks, the iterative process can become prohibitive, especially when dealing with complex datasets that require more parameters.\n\nIn contrast, the multi-head attention mechanism in ViTs is designed to handle complex datasets by allowing the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously. This mechanism is more scalable and efficient for larger models, as it can be parallelized across multiple heads, making it suitable for high-resolution datasets like ImageNet. The multi-head attention mechanism reduces the computational burden by distributing the attention computations across multiple heads, which can be efficiently implemented on modern GPUs.\n\nIn summary, iterative routing in capsule networks is more beneficial for small networks and simpler datasets, while multi-head attention in ViTs is more scalable and efficient for larger models and complex datasets.

This choice is beneficial for real-time applications as it reduces computational complexity. The unit plane projection ensures that the camera's pose is represented in a consistent and intuitive manner, which is crucial for closed-loop control.\n\n2. **Number of Clones**: Using 9 clones allows for a balance between computational efficiency and robustness. A higher number of clones can improve the filter's ability to handle outliers and maintain consistency, but it also increases computational load. The choice of 9 clones suggests a compromise that aims to balance these factors.\n\n3. **Performance and Accuracy**: These parameter choices likely contribute to the system's robustness and accuracy. The simplified parametrization and projection reduce the risk of numerical issues, while the use of clones enhances the filter's ability to handle noisy measurements.

In the schema, \"Place\" is a parent entity type of \"Person\" and \"Event\". This hierarchical relationship implies that properties associated with \"Place\" are also applicable to its subtypes, \"Person\" and \"Event\". For example, if \"Place\" has a property \"settlement\", then both \"Person\" and \"Event\" can inherit this property.\n\nThis property inheritance has significant implications for entity classification and identification. When classifying entities, the system can leverage the broader context provided by the hierarchy.

Similarly, if an entity is classified as an \"Event\", it inherits properties like \"date\" and \"duration\" from the \"Event\" type.\n\nThis hierarchical inheritance allows for more accurate and nuanced entity classification. By inheriting properties from more general types, entities can be more precisely identified and categorized. For example, an entity classified as an \"Athlete\" would inherit properties like \"gold medalist\" and \"race track\" from the \"Athlete\" type, which might not be applicable to entities classified as \"Person\" or \"Event\".

This involves formalizing knowledge using formal concept analysis lattices and proposing property-based similarity metrics. The chapter validates these metrics through qualitative experiments.\n\nChapter 5 then applies machine learning to recognize entity types. It introduces a pipeline that includes knowledge pre-processing, property-based similarity metric computation, and machine learning recognizers. The chapter distinguishes between schema-level and instance-level recognition and discusses property alignment from different sources. It provides a detailed discussion on learning algorithm selection, including classic models and novel neural networks. Finally, it conducts experiments to evaluate the performance of entity type recognition and the proposed similarity metrics.\n\nThe progression from Chapter 4 to Chapter 5 involves moving from data preparation and similarity measurement to applying machine learning techniques for entity type recognition.

Conversely, at lower temperatures (Figure 5-17a), the surface appears lighter and more uniform.\n\nThis temperature-dependent color variation has implications for the identification and verification of 3D printed objects. Since the color of the object can change based on the extruder temperature, it introduces an additional layer of variability that can be used to create unique identifiers for different instances of the same object.

As the filtration threshold increases, new simplices (e.g., edges, triangles, tetrahedra) are added to the simplicial complex, which represents the data. This process creates a sequence of nested simplicial complexes, each representing the data at a different level of detail.\n\nThe filtration process results in the creation of barcodes and persistent diagrams, which are visual representations of the topological features. Barcodes are a sequence of intervals, where each interval represents a topological feature (e.g., a loop, a void) that appears at a certain filtration threshold and persists until a later threshold. The length of the interval indicates the persistence of the feature, with longer intervals indicating more persistent features.\n\nPersistent diagrams, on the other hand, are a more detailed representation of the topological features. Each point in the diagram corresponds to a topological feature, with the x-axis representing the birth time (when the feature first appears) and the y-axis representing the death time (when the feature disappears). The persistence of a feature is indicated by the distance between its birth and death points.\n\nThese representations convey important information about the topological features of the data, such as the number and persistence of loops, voids, and higher-dimensional holes. By analyzing these features, researchers can gain insights into the underlying structure and dynamics of the data, which can be particularly useful in fields like biology, physics, and materials science.","source":"data/test/2408.11948.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[129,131,124,136,130,141,17,122,18,15,145,16,144,142,133,135,126,48,56,85,4,127,132,134,166,109,143,158,148,7,168,165,128,119,157,139,121,53,125,123,64,31,140,110,37,149,13,43,49,74,120,73,75,112,117,138,154,167,76,78,159,3,11,24,46,108,163,25,80,147,84,111,115,155,6,47,63,66,161,28,33,68,102,10,77,104,150,153,156,9,29,32,45,58,93,100,114,35,36,65,72,79,118,151,164,14,30,82,137,152,160,42,92,50,54,86,27,38,61,83,98,5,44,52,21,51,57,70,103,105,116,39,55,94,113,146,162,26,97,34,60,69,106,71,99,90,19,59,1,91,87,67,12,20,81,40,88,96,89,22,62,41,23,101,95,8,107,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Unlike library complexity, cell complexity is agnostic to the number of genes expressed by the cells, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of cell behavior across different stages of development and differentiation.\n\nPotential advantages of cell complexity include:\n\n1. **Enhanced resolution**: It can better distinguish between cells with similar gene expression profiles but different developmental stages or cell types.\n2. **Dynamic interactions**: It captures the evolving nature of cell interactions over time, which is crucial for understanding developmental trajectories.\n3. **Biological relevance**: By focusing on cell-cell interactions, it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying cell communication and signaling.\n4. **Robustness**: It is less dependent on the number of genes expressed, making it more reliable for comparing cells across different conditions or developmental stages.\n\nOverall, cell complexity offers a more sophisticated and biologically meaningful approach to analyzing single-cell data, particularly for studying complex cellular processes and interactions.","source":"data/test/2408.11948.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[121,140,122,125,142,123,133,143,4,139,148,120,18,165,17,119,109,144,25,138,124,141,166,145,157,168,158,108,137,46,131,127,149,15,49,135,29,72,134,7,146,3,163,167,47,48,77,129,150,151,32,104,130,147,161,45,64,9,78,82,85,44,83,105,63,100,24,75,103,28,71,16,61,76,94,112,159,39,42,43,56,132,62,79,110,13,60,102,36,41,52,69,6,27,80,155,162,30,50,68,118,31,58,65,93,154,51,74,84,126,14,59,86,91,11,73,152,33,37,153,53,106,136,156,164,35,38,70,111,66,81,26,160,1,34,117,128,19,55,87,10,12,98,114,40,57,115,5,8,92,99,113,97,95,88,90,89,20,54,67,116,96,101,21,107,22,23,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This disengagement can hinder the development of deep-level understanding, as deep-level learning requires sustained attention and active processing of information.\n\nHowever, the negative correlation is not as strong as that observed for zone-out patterns, which are characterized by a lack of awareness and a more prolonged disengagement from the task. This suggests that while MM can be detrimental to learning, it is less harmful compared to unaware mind wandering. The study's findings indicate that the zone-out pattern, which is more prevalent and less aware, has a stronger negative impact on learning outcomes, particularly on fact-based and inference-based learning.

By using body pose embeddings, the approach can identify hand-raising events even when students are partially occluded by classmates or learning materials. This allows for the automated annotation of hand-raising instances for individual students, overcoming the challenges of manually rating student behavior and the limitations of crowdsourcing due to data protection regulations.\n\nThe proposed method also addresses the issue of small sample sizes and limited generalizability by employing a dataset from 36 real-world classroom videos, capturing 127 students from grades 5 to 12. This comprehensive dataset enables the study to investigate the relationship between hand-raising and learning activities, providing valuable insights into student engagement and active participation in the classroom.","source":"data/test/2407.05803.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[208,207,216,206,59,61,60,215,62,205,253,39,211,213,63,210,241,23,209,31,65,212,6,254,214,41,11,68,13,217,12,155,130,184,66,15,67,134,53,84,149,145,179,78,74,113,131,114,156,161,227,72,180,48,176,36,148,154,163,139,153,172,226,50,51,135,178,34,47,147,52,138,157,158,177,102,133,137,151,152,201,225,64,112,132,218,108,110,9,21,28,43,56,186,199,22,40,82,230,25,38,49,55,90,146,162,220,69,174,189,200,202,243,42,92,141,160,251,32,187,198,81,164,235,240,57,70,80,93,142,54,109,144,173,233,83,95,116,175,35,76,94,136,88,167,185,229,237,249,26,29,58,71,111,86,118,128,140,170,27,73,104,120,219,45,191,250,30,85,100,124,181,188,193,224,231,79,165,183,17,46,107,150,194,197,33,98,168,192,195,77,232,14,24,159,7,44,106,196,247,115,8,75,126,203,228,242,245,99,169,16,91,248,117,96,101,166,37,103,236,252,190,222,239,97,122,244,89,87,234,204,10,238,105,182,119,223,125,18,143,171,121,221,246,19,123,129,1,4,127,3,20,2,5],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

For instance, the distance between points a and b is 2, between a and c is 2, and so on. The map attempts to place these points in such a way that the distances between them in the map closely match the distances in the matrix.\n\nThe map shows that points a, b, and c are relatively close to each other, as indicated by the small distances in the matrix.

The upper bound is derived by considering the probability of sampling a new vote in each iteration, which decreases as \\( \\alpha \\) increases, leading to fewer unique votes.","source":"data/test/2407.11889.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,96,28,97,95,36,142,55,166,156,102,120,57,169,184,100,160,146,38,144,50,66,105,170,30,98,74,167,22,117,168,33,35,123,162,53,93,103,143,165,157,11,12,104,141,151,14,34,51,71,86,140,145,164,172,27,109,148,155,59,72,29,54,132,152,189,31,21,90,92,115,133,85,114,119,9,79,161,112,187,20,61,122,126,130,65,70,116,135,43,52,88,107,13,15,45,60,75,82,154,84,128,131,134,147,186,48,56,76,91,94,118,127,179,111,137,158,192,44,150,10,42,46,67,81,159,5,171,47,39,68,125,149,16,40,49,64,78,177,183,163,32,58,121,124,153,62,69,113,3,99,19,41,191,194,2,4,17,63,190,6,7,24,25,101,110,129,182,106,138,195,139,193,197,23,136,175,89,77,87,178,26,188,18,174,176,180,1,73,185,83,173,196,80,108,181,8],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The green dots, representing event aggregations, are distributed across the map, indicating the locations of recurring events.

The red dots, denoting sensor positions, are strategically placed based on the centroid placements derived from the K-means clustering. This strategic placement ensures that sensors are positioned in areas of significant activity, optimizing the monitoring network's efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nThe clustering pattern reveals that the algorithm successfully identifies regions with high activity, which could be crucial for environmental monitoring and analysis. By focusing on these dense regions, the monitoring system can gather more relevant data, potentially leading to better-informed decisions and more accurate predictions. The observed clustering pattern also highlights the importance of spatial proximity in event occurrences, which can be further analyzed to understand the underlying causes and patterns of environmental phenomena.

Adjust the objective function:\n   - Modify the objective function to include the overlap area:\n     Objective = maximize(coverage_sum) - minimize(movement_sum) - λ * ∑_{l∈L} ∑_{m∈L} overlap_area_{l,m}\n     where λ is a penalty factor for overlap.\n\nThese changes would allow the algorithm to find a solution that maximizes coverage while respecting the constraint on the maximum allowed overlap area.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[71,70,68,75,175,58,76,73,54,61,57,482,484,31,126,145,249,369,24,53,480,485,64,144,248,67,14,338,95,150,66,189,282,481,220,60,63,65,206,221,483,370,59,136,253,313,332,153,217,244,50,171,173,263,368,45,132,51,134,417,47,235,333,35,49,131,298,404,62,32,219,252,257,39,72,286,38,266,316,337,371,469,213,236,247,214,336,383,56,130,163,223,304,391,335,386,393,187,212,218,279,318,325,388,405,430,479,25,55,87,285,329,267,334,259,381,387,415,52,113,164,245,385,394,3,15,85,122,165,174,210,297,301,344,395,414,465,33,140,172,29,156,176,256,260,365,422,77,186,193,292,306,309,340,157,166,216,283,354,358,478,9,13,34,207,239,476,27,135,152,168,211,232,317,118,238,287,439,446,8,78,124,240,303,366,419,420,23,46,48,83,97,117,342,349,108,141,243,258,274,299,432,470,16,26,116,148,190,242,281,294,296,421,464,69,188,198,199,261,346,376,423,43,110,268,347,359,363,450,21,202,222,295,378,416,434,10,11,114,162,167,246,280,305,455,22,74,91,127,159,284,300,302,328,389,392,409,411,460,36,40,84,112,120,129,143,197,201,250,311,322,451,461,472,12,92,226,231,262,277,382,390,403,2,82,181,183,362,427,5,154,255,323,435,4,41,44,94,184,237,312,314,384,396,412,436,473,6,28,115,119,137,185,200,315,348,375,431,449,133,204,271,330,379,380,397,438,457,17,178,179,278,326,477,42,80,98,293,37,289,356,401,429,486,101,103,147,151,161,205,272,310,345,351,377,399,440,475,30,93,100,169,192,208,241,324,357,367,442,448,468,20,81,275,307,408,413,428,445,142,264,273,341,350,447,459,111,149,195,291,372,441,471,121,155,234,251,327,355,374,418,7,88,99,102,182,361,364,400,444,79,109,146,203,227,402,424,426,458,467,86,125,170,254,288,308,343,360,452,474,1,105,138,319,373,453,463,276,96,106,123,265,331,437,462,18,180,230,107,158,194,339,353,407,410,433,90,104,196,224,321,139,160,191,290,398,209,228,269,456,425,443,128,320,177,215,233,89,270,406,466,19,352,229,454,225,487],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Immediate impact metrics include the interception rate, which measures the percentage of successfully intercepted invaders out of the total number of attempted breaches. A higher interception rate indicates a more effective defense strategy. Additionally, the time to neutralize threats, which assesses the average time taken by defenders to detect, engage, and neutralize invaders, provides insight into the responsiveness and efficiency of the defense system.\n\nLong-term adaptability can be evaluated through metrics such as resource efficiency, which analyzes how effectively the defenders utilize their available resources to maximize interception rates and minimize response times. The adaptability score, which reflects the defense system’s ability to adapt to new or evolving threats over time, can be calculated by dividing the number of adaptations to new threats by the total number of encountered threats. This score indicates the system's capacity to incorporate lessons learned from past invasions to improve future defense responses.\n\nBy combining these metrics, a comprehensive assessment of the defense strategy's effectiveness can be achieved, ensuring that both its immediate impact and long-term adaptability are considered.","source":"data/test/2406.07473.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[445,447,446,454,39,67,334,465,105,312,139,187,442,81,248,433,437,439,457,102,108,51,93,112,188,415,155,96,260,269,11,45,113,416,83,98,436,450,470,36,37,117,118,256,332,393,207,262,392,474,97,166,178,335,395,432,438,451,245,430,449,17,94,103,333,425,19,60,176,422,458,9,65,251,401,440,448,33,35,72,100,101,193,255,417,429,435,452,466,247,424,76,138,200,41,156,198,441,444,467,66,110,143,394,40,59,88,109,129,242,338,354,397,420,431,104,259,325,434,468,38,95,127,337,426,443,12,58,99,144,270,294,372,376,411,43,61,400,404,27,71,130,252,350,407,456,469,16,44,106,148,179,214,246,257,396,419,428,478,5,15,78,84,87,168,180,240,402,459,29,107,111,282,347,453,460,18,119,73,115,151,234,366,455,353,413,79,211,261,77,91,120,140,141,250,374,472,473,34,56,137,142,414,206,212,236,306,418,85,90,167,201,213,26,186,243,249,356,403,421,464,42,195,461,471,68,89,135,244,336,14,116,232,368,381,149,210,219,235,339,427,24,55,348,373,377,133,192,233,238,343,379,408,258,387,169,190,263,375,410,412,1,23,114,157,209,346,384,483,228,382,399,383,423,463,123,154,199,227,385,52,300,359,50,147,159,160,288,362,406,485,4,57,92,132,48,409,22,370,380,80,122,124,145,208,340,405,202,398,75,128,152,276,319,344,388,134,136,241,345,316,342,371,32,46,70,484,8,63,131,476,10,54,82,21,189,229,239,314,328,358,386,462,479,223,225,341,365,6,7,121,194,283,326,329,158,171,191,215,327,331,486,313,378,30,153,161,196,284,315,317,352,369,126,162,172,216,217,330,349,86,165,253,295,13,267,361,25,220,291,318,363,367,49,174,237,264,297,308,231,296,475,47,221,268,278,285,286,351,390,31,203,289,309,355,477,20,265,266,277,301,302,321,389,164,185,290,310,357,360,481,53,173,204,287,311,364,391,64,163,224,271,272,273,299,320,480,183,218,222,298,170,181,184,205,150,226,303,28,182,292,307,487,279,482,3,293,125,197,322,323,254,304,177,280,324,274,281,305,69,275,175,2,62,230,146,74],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This allows for precise reasoning about the state of entities and the likelihood of events occurring. The strengths of this approach are its ability to handle complex event reasoning and its interpretability, as the reasoning steps are explicitly represented. However, it requires significant upfront effort to create the structured representation, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\nThe language-based approach, on the other hand, uses a natural language representation of events. This allows for more flexible and human-like reasoning, as it can handle a wider variety of event types and can be more easily adapted to new situations. The strengths of this approach are its flexibility and ease of use, as it does not require a structured representation. However, it may lack interpretability, as the reasoning steps are not explicitly represented and can be harder to follow.\n\nIn general, the symbolic approach might be preferable when dealing with well-defined and complex event scenarios where interpretability is crucial.

The further drop in performance when both layers are removed suggests that the crossmodal layers are particularly important for integrating the information from the unimodal layers effectively.\n\nIn summary, the performance drop when either the unimodal or crossmodal layers are removed highlights their essential roles in the model's architecture, with the crossmodal layers playing a more critical role in integrating and enhancing the performance across different modalities.","source":"data/test/2404.18976.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[168,169,23,22,19,167,157,30,165,166,161,152,18,9,163,156,158,59,89,32,170,151,150,160,141,113,142,90,171,76,129,115,154,88,119,94,111,48,72,86,102,107,110,140,127,149,195,143,126,164,175,15,121,188,52,114,162,87,147,196,200,21,79,131,137,145,74,139,153,25,130,96,99,14,97,16,20,69,116,146,155,45,75,84,91,133,192,39,85,112,125,135,144,174,77,98,191,27,176,201,206,211,38,50,95,101,190,194,26,29,118,138,210,13,58,73,100,173,56,57,64,71,183,202,204,17,31,35,189,212,34,106,122,178,187,51,62,104,70,83,93,105,184,199,42,47,120,123,193,7,33,37,103,124,128,148,159,180,8,55,78,108,197,198,208,53,92,109,177,203,205,209,44,54,65,67,82,136,185,11,41,60,207,61,68,179,182,3,4,24,66,132,186,213,63,117,49,40,46,134,5,28,36,80,12,172,2,43,6,181,214,81,1,10],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

Discrete modalities, like speech or text, naturally segment into distinct units (words, phrases) that can be easily aligned. Continuous modalities, such as audio or video, lack clear segmentation boundaries, making it difficult to identify corresponding elements across different modalities.\n\nTo address these challenges, continuous alignment employs techniques that focus on capturing the temporal and spatial relationships between elements. Continuous warping involves representing continuous signals as continuous representation spaces and aligning them through a warping process. This can be achieved using adversarial training, where one representation space is warped into another to minimize the ability of a domain classifier to distinguish between them. Dynamic time warping (DTW) is another technique that segments and aligns multi-view time-series data by maximizing their similarity through time warping.\n\nAdditionally, modality segmentation is crucial in continuous alignment. This involves dividing high-dimensional data into elements with semantically meaningful boundaries. Temporal segmentation, for example, aims to discover temporal boundaries across sequential data. Techniques like forced alignment, factored hidden Markov models, and clustering approaches are employed to achieve this segmentation, enabling the alignment of continuous signals across different modalities.","source":"data/test/2404.18976.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,50,37,44,13,118,6,146,12,28,38,121,136,174,24,11,126,3,45,57,43,30,25,51,27,122,16,52,123,138,60,172,18,42,92,102,125,137,36,54,58,116,20,41,62,81,150,155,170,53,117,195,32,49,90,143,168,183,191,202,77,173,34,40,56,107,188,61,63,108,159,7,175,139,147,171,31,46,64,66,156,9,87,111,112,153,209,69,74,75,85,120,127,162,187,19,93,151,154,164,206,15,29,89,59,131,72,109,157,177,68,78,94,103,114,152,180,200,21,67,70,86,124,134,22,73,106,119,133,189,14,181,194,47,79,80,128,149,160,193,201,207,113,132,161,165,176,197,26,35,65,95,210,5,88,182,184,33,55,71,91,115,141,148,190,203,17,96,104,144,166,167,179,192,196,211,213,99,178,204,23,98,100,101,105,198,205,39,145,158,185,214,83,130,140,208,142,199,84,169,135,163,212,82,4,76,110,129,8,2,186,97,10,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

While high R values indicate that the model can rely on the shared information between modalities, they do not necessarily guarantee robust performance. The relationship between R and performance drops is not as straightforward as with S. High R values can sometimes lead to performance drops, but the correlation is weaker compared to S. This suggests that redundancy alone is not sufficient to ensure model robustness against missing modalities.\n\nIn summary, large synergy values (S) are more detrimental to model performance when a modality is missing, as they indicate a strong dependency on that specific modality.

A smaller nozzle would allow for taller components to be handled.\n\n4. **Component Mass Limit**: Increasing the maximum component mass that can be lifted would expand the system's capability to handle larger and heavier components.\n\n5. **Component Height Limit**: Extending the linear potentiometer's maximum extension would allow for taller components to be picked up, further enhancing the system's versatility.\n\nThese improvements would collectively enhance the LaserFactory's ability to handle a wider range of components, making it more versatile and capable of fabricating more complex devices.","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[57,56,111,46,43,58,42,40,24,39,50,45,11,54,51,55,12,8,44,32,52,112,33,72,106,109,71,114,60,80,7,37,118,113,27,47,76,107,3,22,34,35,21,102,31,13,41,78,25,84,115,83,105,26,19,36,49,59,23,75,124,17,28,48,81,20,87,126,123,127,110,85,14,86,122,53,95,73,79,89,108,90,5,9,125,97,101,66,117,128,68,70,63,93,120,91,100,121,69,15,65,119,4,67,103,6,38,62,92,1,98,99,2,18,74,104,30,116,29,94,96,61,10,82,88,16,64,77],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}
{"question":"How does the observed discrepancy between the predicted and measured repulsive forces in the magnetic interaction experiment relate to the concept of coercivity, and what adjustments were made to the model to account for this discrepancy?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[97],"raw_output":"","pred":"The observed discrepancy between the predicted and measured repulsive forces in the magnetic interaction experiment can be attributed to the concept of coercivity. Coercivity refers to the magnetic field strength required to reverse the magnetization of a material. In the context of this experiment, the soft magnetic faces of the magnetic sheets exhibit low coercivity, which means they can easily realign to an attractive equilibrium when two attractive magnetic dipoles are brought into contact. This realignment reduces the repulsive force that would otherwise be expected based on the predicted values.\n\nTo account for this discrepancy, the researchers implemented a scaling factor of 0.09 to the repulsive forces predicted by the correlation model. This scaling factor normalizes the magnitude of the repulsive pixels to those in attraction, effectively adjusting the predicted repulsive forces to better match the measured values. By doing so, the model was able to more accurately predict the force between magnetically programmed faces, as evidenced by the normalized sum of squared differences of 0.014 between the measured and predicted results. This adjustment highlights the importance of considering material properties like coercivity in modeling magnetic interactions.","source":"data/test/2405.12436.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[98,15,96,97,70,99,71,72,36,13,85,100,101,26,94,29,63,84,95,9,103,27,64,44,62,86,28,60,65,92,112,68,107,110,49,35,90,50,105,41,69,83,106,109,61,67,125,122,119,14,42,8,87,128,54,57,88,108,120,25,33,89,118,12,43,76,78,93,104,45,113,124,2,5,34,48,4,24,77,80,121,30,91,123,75,116,10,18,59,81,102,117,126,6,16,82,3,58,74,127,11,22,37,47,56,66,21,39,111,20,38,32,46,55,73,7,1,114,53,19,52,115,23,17,51,31,79,40],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

With a smaller initialization scale (1e-3 and 1e-4), the convergence is faster, and the reconstruction error decreases more rapidly. This is evident from the steeper descent of the curves for these scales. The 1e-2 initialization, on the other hand, shows a slower convergence rate and higher reconstruction error, as indicated by the less steep curve.\n\nFor the rank 3 tensor completion problem, depicted in the right pair of plots, the same trend is observed. The 1e-3 and 1e-4 initializations lead to faster convergence and lower reconstruction error, while the 1e-2 initialization shows slower convergence and higher error.\n\nThe observed trends can be explained by the dynamics of gradient descent. With a smaller initialization scale, the initial components are closer to zero, leading to a more gradual and controlled descent towards the optimal solution. This results in faster convergence and lower reconstruction error. Conversely, a larger initialization scale leads to a more rapid but potentially unstable descent, which can result in slower convergence and higher reconstruction error.

{"question":"Explain how the process of tensor factorization, as illustrated in the provided figure, can be interpreted as a shallow non-linear convolutional network. Discuss the roles of the 1x1 convolution and global pooling operations in this context.","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[40],"raw_output":"","pred":"The process of tensor factorization, as illustrated in the provided figure, can be interpreted as a shallow non-linear convolutional network by understanding its components and their roles. The figure shows a tensor factorization process that involves several key operations: 1x1 convolution, global pooling, and a final summation.\n\n1. **1x1 Convolution**: This operation is analogous to the 1x1 convolution in a neural network. It involves applying a set of learnable filters (W(1), ..., W(N)) to the input tensor (x(1), ..., x(N)). Each filter is applied to a specific mode of the tensor, effectively performing a local operation on the data. This operation is crucial as it allows the network to learn features from the input data in a non-linear manner.\n\n2. **Global Pooling**: This operation is similar to global pooling in a neural network, where the activations from the 1x1 convolution are pooled globally. In the context of tensor factorization, this means taking the product of all activations in each channel. This step introduces a polynomial non-linearity into the model, as the product of the activations is not linear. This non-linearity is essential for capturing complex relationships in the data.\n\n3. **Summation**: The final step involves summing the outputs of the global pooling operation to produce the scalar output. This summation is akin to the output layer in a neural network, combining the results from the previous layers to produce the final prediction.\n\nOverall, the 1x1 convolution and global pooling operations together create a non-linear transformation of the input data, similar to what is achieved in a shallow non-linear convolutional network. The tensor factorization process, therefore, can be seen as a shallow non-linear convolutional network that processes multi-dimensional data through a series of local and global operations.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[23,40,27,41,39,25,35,24,143,142,57,141,4,5,36,89,33,144,74,43,118,125,13,54,37,93,8,32,145,22,120,150,26,50,92,31,86,42,82,81,87,55,146,3,30,128,167,44,147,178,29,45,47,175,177,180,20,179,38,46,79,151,21,48,80,206,78,188,11,12,187,49,84,204,77,130,164,170,7,62,76,64,14,176,61,83,191,91,190,60,189,28,58,94,121,85,152,63,138,156,192,110,127,166,169,184,16,88,153,17,18,65,171,186,199,182,202,34,95,122,196,9,72,71,52,172,53,119,173,149,159,203,10,109,111,205,108,126,174,181,19,69,90,197,59,158,183,75,195,131,67,134,163,160,185,200,56,148,162,165,51,66,106,132,70,68,112,161,201,101,193,194,198,97,107,133,140,15,99,100,105,114,104,123,168,103,129,154,98,157,116,124,2,6,96,135,155,115,1,113,73,137,102,136,139,117],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This simplification is crucial for the subsequent derivation of the upper bound for the effective rank.\n\nTo remove this assumption and establish a bound that holds for all loss values, the proof proceeds by considering the bounds on σ1(WM) and σ2(WM) from Lemma 21.

In a GNN, the AGGREGATE function combines the hidden embeddings of a vertex's neighbors to update its own embedding. This aggregation process is crucial as it determines how information is propagated and integrated across the graph structure.\n\nWhen the AGGREGATE function is a product aggregation operator, as defined in Equation (5.5), it allows the GNN to model interactions between vertices through polynomial functions of their inputs. This means that the output of the GNN can be expressed as a polynomial function of the input features, which is a powerful property for modeling complex interactions.\n\nThe implications of using a product aggregation operator are manifold. Firstly, it enables the GNN to capture higher-order interactions between vertices, which is essential for modeling complex relationships in the graph. Secondly, this choice aligns well with the theoretical framework of tensor networks, which can provide insights into the expressive power and computational complexity of GNNs. Lastly, it facilitates the analysis of GNNs using separation rank, a measure that quantifies the interaction modeled between subsets of input variables. This theoretical framework helps in understanding how the network's architecture and input graph structure affect its ability to model interactions, leading to practical implications such as edge sparsification algorithms.","source":"data/test/2408.02111.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[61,62,57,172,60,58,177,5,175,176,64,180,173,179,9,59,178,186,3,65,63,71,174,74,67,204,86,76,142,203,202,68,69,72,79,82,78,84,53,4,196,40,8,41,80,85,77,81,144,184,190,23,25,183,83,187,182,7,35,193,87,88,181,13,27,50,75,167,39,89,36,70,147,33,26,52,205,14,92,21,22,42,195,11,185,54,141,188,96,24,44,66,146,38,206,12,29,32,51,189,95,56,197,55,143,148,151,149,191,100,199,132,16,49,20,119,121,122,128,47,109,159,43,105,18,37,171,201,19,150,192,34,90,94,125,133,138,30,48,111,170,198,46,17,91,15,97,158,45,120,126,200,93,194,10,168,118,145,156,2,31,103,104,164,1,153,161,28,108,110,129,154,163,98,160,123,112,169,106,107,130,134,135,139,115,131,124,137,152,113,116,136,140,162,155,127,157,99,101,165,114,166,102,117,6,73],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Swayimane is located in the uMngeni local municipality of uMgungundlovu district, characterized by undulating outcropping hills with an extensive altitudinal range of 2900m. This topography likely affects temperature variations, with summer and winter temperature changes influencing agricultural activities. The village's Zulu tribe and farming and livestock keeping as primary occupations suggest a traditional agricultural lifestyle. The terrain's undulating nature might necessitate specific farming techniques and equipment.\n\nIn comparison, Mbeere District in Kenya, as depicted in the map, lies between latitude 0° 20’ and 0° 50’ South and longitude 37°16’ and 37°56’ East, covering an area of 2,097 square kilometres. The Mbeere District is predominantly arid and semi-arid, with a temperature range of 20ºC to 32ºC. The terrain's arid classification indicates limited water availability, which significantly impacts agricultural practices, necessitating drought-resistant crops and irrigation systems. The Mbeere community's specialization in crops like melons, sorghum, maize, mangoes, pawpaws, millet, cowpeas, and beans reflects the region's climatic suitability for these crops.\n\nComparatively, Swayimane's higher altitude and varied topography might offer more diverse agricultural opportunities, while Mbeere's arid conditions require more adaptive farming practices. Both regions face challenges related to water scarcity, but Swayimane's higher altitude could potentially offer cooler temperatures, which might be advantageous for certain crops.","source":"data/test/2405.10713.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[99,91,28,98,125,126,25,97,127,19,24,129,144,100,131,246,143,134,8,262,128,18,254,114,249,45,237,138,130,137,210,171,245,136,243,52,32,56,7,212,49,37,253,6,43,51,95,178,251,149,239,36,241,92,135,31,53,33,247,252,275,44,132,50,270,133,66,94,101,192,238,242,244,5,105,139,168,182,267,21,48,231,90,272,151,218,30,71,106,224,250,148,172,116,236,29,155,176,211,38,67,145,169,188,240,69,78,81,96,177,204,256,225,113,166,203,234,89,11,123,228,233,39,46,84,170,207,209,248,263,277,17,55,87,140,13,255,281,20,153,183,184,268,1,147,154,167,208,219,227,229,223,230,261,269,54,68,88,159,156,274,35,150,179,73,103,108,110,157,214,226,9,15,111,173,201,22,85,104,158,187,200,222,232,257,42,186,199,122,189,196,278,12,72,107,206,213,266,282,47,102,220,260,273,276,10,34,79,83,109,121,164,174,202,215,258,77,80,191,198,14,58,75,265,26,60,152,165,271,27,65,160,180,16,194,195,117,124,283,40,57,74,197,235,142,146,185,279,61,62,76,112,190,216,221,120,141,175,286,280,119,118,205,181,82,63,162,64,163,41,59,161,115,93,284,3,86,264,217,193,285,4,23,70,2,259],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What are the primary challenges in defining and predicting drought, and how do these challenges impact the decision-making process for policymakers and scientists?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[43],"raw_output":"","pred":"Defining and predicting drought is challenging due to its complex nature and variability. Drought is characterized by precipitation deficiency, leading to water scarcity in ecosystems. However, its recurrence in susceptible areas is almost inevitable, making it a natural hazard. The lack of a precise definition hinders understanding and decision-making.  Drought can occur due to low precipitation or high temperatures, both of which are difficult to predict.  The variability of scientific weather data and the difficulty in achieving scalability further complicate the prediction process.  This uncertainty impacts policymakers and scientists by hindering effective planning and resource allocation.

This indicates that more data generally leads to better performance.\n\nAfter fine-tuning, the performance gap narrows, with the model trained with 310 hours showing a DER of around 10%, and the model trained with 4961 hours showing a DER of around 7%.

This structure allows for the definition of isomorphic abstractions and pattern-matching, which are essential for ensuring reversibility in the language. The DCPO enrichment of the category further enables the consideration of recursive isos and inductive data types, which are represented using parameterized initial algebras. This enriched structure provides a robust foundation for the language's semantics.\n\nThe significance of this categorical interpretation lies in its ability to bridge the gap between operational and denotational semantics. Adequacy, the focus of the next section, is a strong relation between these two semantics. It ensures that the denotational semantics accurately reflects the operational behavior of the language. Specifically, the theorem 4.29 states that a term is terminating in the operational semantics if and only if its denotational interpretation is not the bottom element in the category. This theorem highlights the importance of the join inverse rig structure in maintaining this correspondence, as it allows for the precise modeling of both terminating and non-terminating computations. The two ways a term can have a non-bottom denotational interpretation—either by reducing in an infinite loop or by being stuck due to pattern-matching—correspond to the two possible behaviors in the operational semantics. This connection is crucial for ensuring that the denotational semantics is both sound and adequate for the operational semantics.","source":"data/test/2406.07216.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[142,45,136,18,108,141,42,127,44,156,3,128,140,173,43,109,125,91,147,33,135,138,10,149,155,144,158,29,129,11,111,130,132,139,49,180,39,126,92,94,22,78,117,120,131,148,30,137,160,17,119,47,61,118,133,143,151,16,25,32,72,79,89,154,70,74,159,169,181,21,95,75,90,123,9,150,107,115,80,122,174,40,101,23,41,71,85,84,26,38,52,59,164,177,56,93,152,13,67,113,134,20,55,116,161,31,112,145,157,179,77,105,121,167,37,46,57,73,99,110,166,15,58,2,14,66,68,88,98,28,82,96,102,162,175,81,146,50,168,178,24,171,1,60,83,176,53,62,97,100,104,165,34,69,19,106,183,184,35,163,36,48,76,182,153,5,114,27,87,51,63,103,64,172,65,6,7,4,8,12,54,86,124,170],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Properly managing angular constraints ensures the algorithm maintains the path's tautness and optimality.\n","source":"data/test/2408.05806.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[69,44,43,53,54,89,75,70,62,94,125,78,77,86,76,51,10,124,137,138,63,153,82,87,56,116,149,40,64,61,100,101,102,6,57,71,73,80,90,117,119,145,7,35,52,74,45,92,118,151,31,85,123,126,36,79,81,93,115,120,16,60,110,136,47,55,103,109,155,25,27,30,59,14,18,88,84,28,50,140,8,67,66,157,198,29,46,174,175,37,39,122,42,48,91,158,95,96,20,68,150,178,58,72,98,128,65,179,199,141,19,23,26,152,12,127,187,201,38,49,163,9,99,114,13,113,2,11,17,41,143,147,148,166,189,205,22,112,121,159,168,83,167,183,186,106,134,139,154,160,177,196,144,180,194,129,193,21,108,104,185,200,195,105,131,111,32,107,162,203,24,133,190,191,97,204,171,176,202,130,135,173,1,172,188,132,156,182,184,33,146,161,169,192,34,206,197,181,142,165,164,5,15,170,3,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This scenario arises when a trace enters the occupied sector of the source node at `xS` and is interrupted. The trace then attempts to reach the target node `xT` but encounters a collision, necessitating a detour.\n\nThe placement of `nad,b` at `x` ensures that the direction vector `vT` (representing the direction from `x` to `xT`) is reoriented such that the angle between `vT` and the direction vector `vSS` (representing the direction from `xS` to `xT`) is less than 180 degrees. This reorientation is crucial because it maintains the validity of the pruning rule for target nodes. The pruning rule relies on the angle between the direction vectors to ensure that the path is taut and admissible.\n\nBy placing `nad,b` at `x`, the algorithm can safely reject any query that reaches `nad,b`. This rejection is justified because the path involving `nad,b` would have intersected or looped with itself, violating the tautness condition. Therefore, queries reaching `nad,b` are considered invalid and can be discarded, ensuring that the algorithm progresses efficiently without revisiting redundant paths.","source":"data/test/2408.05806.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[93,89,94,90,92,82,100,85,10,160,86,159,91,116,44,80,88,124,110,125,76,78,95,98,62,96,123,156,81,120,97,118,153,54,117,119,77,87,60,50,73,99,157,43,154,70,72,53,113,121,158,56,111,166,55,75,101,200,7,102,114,198,79,122,109,112,180,188,83,115,127,201,61,104,151,152,52,45,11,19,40,71,179,36,65,103,27,30,2,194,42,51,128,193,195,63,74,14,39,57,66,135,155,162,186,204,18,64,21,37,69,138,146,147,38,46,126,6,68,174,196,29,48,150,181,26,140,145,169,171,8,20,108,149,172,185,189,58,105,134,13,129,12,175,49,141,197,106,107,136,192,178,182,199,205,202,31,165,177,184,203,17,33,67,130,22,23,28,59,131,137,144,187,190,132,1,35,163,167,168,183,84,133,142,206,24,139,143,164,16,161,5,25,47,173,191,34,41,176,9,170,32,148,15,3,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This property plays a pivotal role in determining the priority of nodes in the open list during the search process. A lower `f_cost` value indicates a more promising node, as it suggests a shorter path to the goal. Consequently, nodes with lower `f_cost` values are more likely to be expanded first, which can significantly influence the algorithm's performance.\n\nThe behavior of the algorithm is influenced by `f_cost` in several ways:\n\n1. **Exploration Efficiency**: Nodes with lower `f_cost` are explored first, potentially leading to a faster discovery of the optimal path. This can reduce the overall search time and improve the algorithm's efficiency.\n\n2. **Avoidance of Inefficient Paths**: By prioritizing nodes with lower `f_cost`, the algorithm can avoid exploring paths that are unlikely to lead to the optimal solution, thus saving computational resources.\n\n3. **Path Optimization**: Lower `f_cost` values can guide the algorithm towards more efficient paths, minimizing unnecessary turns and collisions, which is particularly beneficial in environments with many disjoint obstacles.\n\n4. **Pruning**: Nodes with higher `f_cost` are less likely to be expanded, which can help in pruning unnecessary branches early in the search process, further enhancing efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the `f_cost` property is a key factor in determining the algorithm's exploration strategy and efficiency, influencing how the search process is directed towards finding the optimal path.","source":"data/test/2408.05806.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[8,166,110,130,134,174,111,126,158,118,168,37,98,129,180,160,165,12,97,96,139,13,128,157,108,109,112,161,175,182,18,30,99,184,100,138,19,156,2,38,85,103,114,116,204,106,122,132,155,20,84,88,104,102,171,78,94,192,31,117,86,131,87,115,178,194,7,39,82,120,153,172,199,190,196,202,90,150,186,10,113,169,35,167,198,124,44,154,162,188,53,92,170,197,200,183,193,25,147,181,164,176,45,177,105,79,101,125,136,187,17,159,205,57,119,127,201,206,203,21,81,195,56,151,189,11,179,191,185,40,173,32,148,23,28,152,95,75,123,27,36,43,137,26,67,69,93,145,16,133,80,121,14,29,107,163,41,83,74,89,34,61,72,76,140,50,135,73,33,42,144,66,68,70,141,143,91,49,6,54,65,149,51,47,71,52,55,60,63,9,24,46,62,58,77,22,1,59,64,146,48,142,15,3,5,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This condition is checked by calculating the dot product of the trace side vector (σ) and the difference vector (vdif) between the target point's anchor coordinates and the root point's coordinates. If the dot product is positive, it indicates that the trace has moved 180 degrees around the target point's Oc sector, and the function erases the trace tree (EraseTree(T, l)) and returns True, indicating the trace is discarded.

This highlights the importance of using models that can adapt to the specific characteristics of real-world data, rather than relying solely on models trained on simulated data.","source":"data/test/2408.09583.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[140,139,130,136,153,46,106,100,131,142,152,95,107,149,9,112,135,143,154,134,129,96,101,120,145,111,118,30,39,88,117,219,109,119,121,122,155,108,124,86,123,125,167,132,141,222,126,148,217,20,110,223,225,90,98,40,220,92,103,104,150,151,163,4,14,21,128,133,47,99,105,164,166,63,87,116,127,41,89,97,102,214,59,159,60,61,218,147,161,221,7,69,179,91,13,212,226,12,8,180,76,162,191,215,216,29,11,54,77,84,93,210,144,168,64,80,42,51,31,32,94,174,65,68,175,176,85,62,178,22,197,56,70,137,158,27,49,52,57,58,71,138,10,26,157,24,36,1,78,50,177,183,53,185,189,113,184,45,25,114,115,170,160,181,44,48,182,198,206,38,37,188,28,207,172,173,196,43,72,156,35,81,66,67,23,55,187,209,75,169,194,171,16,19,34,33,79,190,199,2,18,146,193,195,213,73,211,6,15,205,82,186,17,83,74,5,200,204,224,192,203,201,208,165,202,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

HMMs assume that the underlying system follows the Markov property, meaning the probability of transitioning to a new state depends only on the current state and not on the past states. This assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios, especially in dynamic environments where the system's behavior can be influenced by a long history of states and observations. For instance, in ITSC, traffic conditions can evolve over time, and the system's response to current traffic flow may depend on historical traffic patterns.\n\nAdditionally, HMMs heavily rely on sufficient training data to estimate model parameters accurately. In situations where data is scarce or noisy, the performance of HMMs may be compromised. This is particularly problematic in ITSC, where historical traffic data might be limited, especially in newly developed neighborhoods or areas with rapidly changing traffic patterns.\n\nFurthermore, HMMs may struggle with rare events that are not well-represented in the training data. For example, during peak hours, traffic congestion can build up gradually, and the behavior of the system may depend on the traffic conditions experienced over an extended period. HMMs may not accurately capture these long-term dependencies, leading to less effective predictions and control strategies.","source":"data/test/2405.17691.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,36,39,43,56,38,44,45,62,210,213,40,55,5,52,42,58,47,139,18,41,137,53,22,49,50,152,30,214,13,34,61,239,20,21,46,64,151,240,24,51,48,32,65,219,228,140,148,224,113,66,14,117,215,226,35,105,115,235,67,155,206,225,3,68,59,230,8,57,156,161,233,80,110,81,138,207,141,236,31,220,221,222,25,234,63,157,164,19,237,4,198,17,26,60,160,218,229,9,75,180,227,232,153,205,231,116,144,201,203,208,73,204,163,191,23,74,103,196,238,149,162,165,188,209,101,159,33,166,2,10,193,197,200,150,154,183,168,7,106,217,223,28,6,29,69,142,211,78,79,98,178,212,11,100,16,54,158,174,173,192,145,111,172,70,90,118,119,184,167,189,202,130,88,89,186,135,169,179,187,194,176,199,27,120,132,143,216,72,136,171,122,112,175,104,170,91,102,185,190,134,114,121,83,87,124,195,97,126,177,241,109,86,93,107,99,127,71,182,77,94,1,96,85,123,128,181,82,108,129,133,146,125,95,76,84,147,131,92,15,12],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The relationship is particularly strong for samples with very small max margins (< 2), suggesting that the 'ideal margin' is approximately half of the max margin.\n\nIn contrast, for CIFAR10lc, the relationship is weaker and less pronounced.

MNIST, being a simpler dataset, might have a more straightforward relationship between input space proximity and margin, while CIFAR10, with its more complex and diverse images, might have a more nuanced relationship.

As network complexity increases, the average distortion required for a successful adversarial attack decreases. This is evident from the decreasing average distortion values across the table, from 0.123 for FC10-4 to 0.086 for FC100-100-10 and 0.087 for FC200-200-10.\n\n2. Simultaneously, the average persistence of adversarial examples decreases as network complexity increases. This is reflected in the lower persistence values for adversarial examples in more complex networks, such as 0.56 for FC100-100-10 and FC200-200-10 compared to 1.68 for FC10-4.\n\n3. The persistence of natural examples generally increases with network complexity. This is shown by the higher persistence values for natural examples in more complex networks, such as 0.93 for FC10-4 and 0.81 for C-512.\n\n4. The difference in persistence between natural and adversarial examples is smaller for more complex networks. This suggests that the decision boundaries of complex networks are more robust to small perturbations, making it harder to generate stable adversarial examples.\n\n5. The context of using L-BFGS for attack generation implies that the observed trends are due to the optimization process rather than the inherent stability of the network architecture.\n\nOverall, the table and context demonstrate that more complex networks are easier to attack with smaller distortions but also exhibit higher persistence in both natural and adversarial examples.","source":"data/test/2407.11029v1.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[72,71,69,156,16,154,44,8,58,54,46,60,84,55,40,62,75,9,15,21,61,83,76,158,85,48,70,74,43,59,39,82,52,73,56,68,143,157,5,17,155,41,49,145,142,50,23,45,14,18,38,10,113,51,105,177,189,4,78,190,7,138,176,79,22,42,144,181,47,53,63,192,77,87,118,20,180,160,186,179,152,129,182,188,194,86,25,153,172,80,171,193,92,187,103,137,97,122,174,12,88,94,112,106,111,173,110,57,109,27,93,170,32,13,81,139,184,66,128,146,168,31,130,133,134,165,127,147,195,108,115,136,148,95,107,123,91,117,120,124,167,6,29,90,125,149,185,28,140,178,175,1,65,67,102,114,26,37,89,116,119,131,132,169,104,191,135,161,33,96,11,24,34,101,30,35,121,183,64,164,36,141,159,162,150,163,98,166,99,126,151,19,2,100,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4}]}

This capability enables GCNs to achieve higher ROC-AUC values, indicating better discrimination between active and inactive molecules across the datasets.","source":"data/test/2407.12243.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[93,92,96,50,14,95,56,51,94,53,52,11,30,10,55,16,75,13,97,57,76,79,78,66,89,142,21,86,108,54,90,46,77,106,128,27,152,156,110,81,107,140,141,144,150,157,64,113,19,151,39,42,155,29,58,149,154,158,111,127,145,98,65,134,43,137,84,87,82,83,109,8,91,138,18,85,153,71,147,148,80,136,17,59,100,143,40,69,118,135,68,105,117,133,26,47,60,41,70,63,112,132,62,22,116,28,49,38,72,119,3,48,139,20,24,36,74,32,67,104,122,33,131,34,37,73,146,35,44,124,31,99,129,159,25,115,101,121,120,61,125,7,15,102,1,2,103,123,9,5,6,12,4,45,130,88,126,114,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This suggests that optimizing for Detection Accuracy leads to explanations that better cover the samples where there is an overlap between label annotations and neuron activation.\n\nThe improvement in Sample Coverage indicates that the algorithm is more effective at identifying the relevant samples for the neuron's activation, which is crucial for understanding the neuron's role in the model's decision-making process. This aligns with the goal of Detection Accuracy, which measures the bijection from the overlapping set between label annotations and neuron activation to the set of label annotations.\n\nHowever, the scores for other metrics show a mixed response. The IoU (Intersection Over Union) score remains low (0.01 ± 0.03), suggesting that optimizing for Detection Accuracy does not significantly improve the alignment between label annotations and activation maps. Activation Coverage (ActCov) also drops to zero, indicating that optimizing for Detection Accuracy does not enhance the neuron's exclusivity for the activation range.\n\nThese results suggest that optimizing for Detection Accuracy leads to explanations that are more focused on covering relevant samples but does not necessarily improve the alignment between activation maps and label annotations. This highlights the need for a multi-metric approach to evaluate the quality of neuron explanations, as different metrics capture different aspects of the explanation's effectiveness.","source":"data/test/2407.12243.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[111,104,66,51,79,110,13,14,80,67,52,108,55,78,11,22,57,68,93,76,92,65,86,87,7,44,145,10,81,94,95,107,33,50,106,38,53,116,21,98,113,34,96,41,43,84,39,69,118,136,82,151,27,32,77,83,129,137,8,18,20,46,58,75,42,64,90,147,149,60,105,133,24,40,112,140,144,56,127,159,70,121,128,54,109,138,141,150,19,36,37,97,120,122,124,158,35,91,119,71,89,134,3,26,31,85,117,125,135,143,123,139,142,154,157,28,153,155,17,49,62,115,131,152,48,63,74,148,132,100,146,30,73,99,156,59,47,16,72,25,15,29,114,12,101,1,2,45,130,61,103,5,88,102,126,6,9,4,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This can help developers identify and address biases in their models, ensuring fair and unbiased predictions.\n\n2. Understanding model decision-making: Memory Wrap allows developers to see which samples from memory are most influential in a model's predictions. This can provide insights into how the model is making decisions. For instance, if a model is relying too heavily on certain features (like background color), this can be identified by examining the memory samples associated with high weights. This transparency can help developers improve model interpretability and trustworthiness.\n\nBy providing this level of insight into model behavior, Memory Wrap can help developers identify and address potential issues that may not be apparent from accuracy metrics alone.

This indicates that CDPG is effective in generating code that compiles successfully. Additionally, CDPG significantly reduces the number of PEP8 errors, achieving the lowest count of 5.2, which is notably lower than the other methods. \n\nIn contrast, DPG shows a lower compilability score of around 0.6 and a higher number of PEP8 errors, indicating that it struggles to maintain both compilability and PEP8 compliance. Ziegler maintains a similar level of compilability to CDPG but has a higher number of PEP8 errors, suggesting it may sacrifice code quality for compilability. Reinforce, on the other hand, heavily departs from the original model, pushing it to mention a large number of named entities, which results in artificially inflated recall-target but no increase in precision-source and a decrease in ROUGE-L.

Specifically, the text states:\n\n\"One limitation of DPG is that, in contrast with KL-regularised RL, it only allows for approximating target distributions defined for unconditional LMs. However, the most impactful downstream applications of LMs involve conditional tasks (such as machine translation, summarisation or dialogue), in which we sample from an LM based on a specific context (e.g., source document or dialogue history).\"\n\nOvercoming this limitation is important for practical applications of language models because many of the most important NLP tasks involve conditional generation. For example, machine translation requires generating text based on a source document, summarization involves generating a summary based on a given text, and dialogue systems rely on generating responses based on previous utterances. \n\nBy extending DPG to handle conditional target distributions, the author aims to enable more fine-grained control over language model behavior in these downstream applications. This could lead to improved performance and more accurate generation of text in specific contexts, which is crucial for applications like machine translation, summarization, and dialogue systems.","source":"data/test/2404.12150.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[42,28,57,43,25,41,29,31,8,46,27,78,18,32,85,86,54,50,6,44,12,89,15,74,45,33,58,17,90,10,91,52,56,30,84,76,24,9,48,13,20,35,71,55,16,37,75,79,118,34,14,59,5,19,26,129,21,145,73,120,130,36,60,125,126,51,22,23,102,105,122,124,68,11,69,2,39,65,132,49,67,95,103,116,117,53,134,61,77,92,121,136,142,47,87,115,138,143,144,72,104,140,137,108,147,70,109,110,123,128,139,106,141,7,66,82,131,107,133,64,98,135,146,1,38,63,113,112,119,3,127,81,93,97,101,62,88,111,148,94,100,80,40,99,83,114,96,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The slope of the linear regression line, denoted as α, is calculated to be -1.480. This slope is used to set the parameter 'd' in the BLL equation.\n\nThe parameter 'd' in the BLL equation represents the rate at which the re-listening count of a genre decays over time. A negative value of 'd' indicates that the re-listening count decreases as time passes since the last listening event. The value of -1.480 obtained from the linear regression provides a quantifiable measure of this decay rate.\n\nThis parameter selection is crucial for the transparency and accuracy of the BLLu music recommendation algorithm.

This approach allows the algorithm to efficiently navigate through the vast space of possible derivations, making the learning process more manageable and scalable. By concentrating on derivations that are more probable, CKY-E2 ensures that the model can learn from a smaller set of examples, thereby improving data efficiency and enabling the model to generalize well to novel compositions of words.

{"question":"How does the concept of typicality relate to the bad mode problem in the context of natural language generation, and why might atypicality sometimes be beneficial?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[47],"raw_output":"","pred":"The concept of typicality is crucial in understanding the bad mode problem in natural language generation. Typically, a random variable X follows a distribution D, and the typical set S is defined as the set of samples where the probability of observing that sample is not much more or less likely than the average sample. This means that typical samples are those that are neither extremely unlikely nor extremely likely to be observed.\n\nThe bad mode problem arises when the most likely attribute value (the mode) does not align with the attribute value of the most likely string. This can occur because the distribution might have a low entropy, making the mode less likely to be observed. For example, in a biased coin flip scenario, the most likely number of heads might not align with the most likely sequence of heads.\n\nAtypicality, or the lack of equality between the most likely attribute value and the most likely string, can sometimes be beneficial. This is because it allows for the exploration of diverse and potentially high-quality outputs that might not be typical. For instance, in text generation, using locally typical sampling can lead to outputs that are representative of the information content of natural text, even if they are not the most likely sequences. This can be particularly useful in tasks where creativity and representativeness are valued over simply maximizing the likelihood of a specific sequence.","source":"data/test/2408.16241.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[46,48,83,47,53,64,86,45,15,42,57,62,59,89,49,18,60,51,52,17,44,22,13,50,78,25,87,6,12,65,88,19,24,71,7,16,54,56,81,85,43,68,116,31,41,77,28,72,66,27,75,10,38,91,101,34,76,84,4,2,11,26,63,69,94,55,30,61,70,111,80,103,23,99,58,39,8,3,20,29,74,82,93,40,100,14,21,95,33,102,110,36,92,98,105,96,114,97,109,115,37,32,35,112,90,73,104,118,9,79,1,106,117,5,67,113,108,107],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The plots show that the value gained is higher when the estimation noise is reduced (σ2\n2) compared to when it is not (σ2\n1). This indicates that the effectiveness of DEM capabilities in increasing value is directly proportional to the reduction in estimation noise.

In a real-world scenario, a company might be deciding between investing in a new product feature (e.g., a voice assistant) versus enhancing an existing one (e.g., improving the user interface of an existing app).  Without DEM capabilities, the company might prioritize the new feature based on initial estimates, which could be highly uncertain and noisy.  This could lead to the new feature being prioritized over the existing one, even if the existing feature has a higher true value.\n\nBy investing in DEM capabilities, the company can reduce the estimation noise.  This allows for more accurate prioritization based on true values rather than noisy estimates.  For example, if the true value of the new feature is actually lower than initially estimated, DEM capabilities would reveal this, allowing the company to prioritize the existing feature, which has a higher true value.\n\nThis prioritization based on true values can lead to better long-term decision-making, as the company invests in features that will actually drive the most value for their customers and business.  The reduced estimation noise also allows the company to make more confident decisions with less uncertainty, potentially leading to more successful outcomes.\n","source":"data/test/2405.03579.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,62,60,36,39,66,68,47,46,41,48,38,43,61,17,45,197,40,44,144,54,59,42,67,226,49,56,20,63,5,21,55,146,23,162,19,53,64,235,119,65,33,199,163,225,159,168,193,18,35,131,145,227,58,161,177,112,178,95,149,152,157,164,165,172,190,195,230,50,87,132,141,151,188,114,129,231,2,6,10,22,80,116,136,194,198,200,224,229,51,76,94,232,73,134,176,15,30,32,130,166,174,179,192,219,234,243,28,97,160,170,233,88,99,183,189,191,228,11,102,142,29,86,90,113,239,244,245,72,107,173,180,253,12,77,79,83,125,143,153,209,57,75,93,100,105,204,82,140,181,182,186,220,221,24,121,133,139,156,171,196,237,91,101,110,124,138,241,14,96,106,111,137,155,206,215,242,52,78,236,89,118,210,222,240,3,85,126,238,250,251,27,70,109,213,214,92,108,128,98,115,117,185,187,201,205,249,7,120,154,13,16,71,84,148,169,69,127,184,202,208,211,246,252,104,147,158,216,217,26,81,247,167,254,9,25,150,175,31,74,135,203,248,4,207,212,34,218,123,1,122,223,103,8],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Conversely, a larger ψ value results in a smoother model, which is better suited for data that exhibits less variability and can be approximated by simpler, smoother functions.\n\nThe relationship between ψ and the model's ability to fit different types of data is direct: smaller ψ values enable the model to fit more complex, non-linear data, while larger ψ values are more effective for fitting simpler, linear or nearly linear data.

While a standard convolution of size (Cout, Cin, k1, k2) requires C2k2 operations, a depthwise separable convolution reduces this to Ck2 operations.  This is because the depthwise convolution (Cout, Cin, k1) is applied to each channel independently, followed by a pointwise convolution (Cout, Cout, 1, 1) that combines the outputs.  This results in a substantial reduction in the number of operations, especially for large kernels.\n\nHowever, this comes at the cost of increased memory usage.  The depthwise separable convolution requires storing two separate kernels (depthwise and pointwise) instead of one.  Additionally, the memory footprint of the depthwise separable convolution is larger due to the need to store the intermediate results of the depthwise convolution.\n\nDesign trade-offs involve balancing computational efficiency with memory usage.  If memory is a limiting factor, depthwise separable convolutions may be preferred despite the increased computational cost.

The Gaussian kernel model has a slightly lower Top-5 accuracy (96.18%) compared to the bilinear model (96.11%).\n\n4. The Gaussian kernel model has a higher throughput (285.4 samples/s) compared to the bilinear model (277.5 samples/s).\n\nThese results suggest that the Gaussian interpolation is more effective than bilinear interpolation for DCLS in ConvNeXt-T:\n\n1. It leads to slightly better Top-1 accuracy, indicating improved classification performance.\n\n2. It maintains similar parameter count and training loss, suggesting comparable complexity.\n\n3. While slightly lower Top-5 accuracy, the higher throughput implies better efficiency.\n\n4. The higher throughput suggests that the Gaussian kernel model may be more suitable for real-world applications where speed is important.\n\nThis indicates that Gaussian interpolation can provide a performance boost for DCLS in ConvNeXt-T, potentially making it a preferred choice for this architecture.","source":"data/test/2408.06383.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[108,134,64,154,63,153,62,24,102,109,112,141,155,144,20,67,130,9,157,19,73,98,16,27,57,139,142,11,21,55,68,96,156,97,143,148,61,66,70,95,152,26,65,71,23,45,94,106,22,150,120,124,133,48,53,103,104,17,47,52,129,18,44,69,107,49,101,50,60,126,132,82,93,125,38,39,40,72,105,181,41,51,136,151,167,28,56,123,58,135,158,86,25,34,170,13,87,121,161,35,99,177,74,78,12,42,15,169,131,116,171,111,127,172,46,122,173,168,75,80,140,178,29,76,164,10,81,90,113,159,110,165,176,30,43,77,79,166,92,115,59,162,179,31,33,117,32,118,36,84,119,1,83,85,160,147,163,88,37,174,145,175,149,89,146,137,91,6,5,2,4,8,14,54,100,114,128,138,180,3,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The camera captures visual features in the environment, which are used to track the robot's position and orientation. The IMU, on the other hand, provides biased acceleration and angular velocity measurements, which are essential for estimating the robot's motion in the absence of visual information.\n\nThe fusion of information from these sensors is achieved through a multi-state constraint equivariant filter (MSCEqF), as described in Chapter 7. This filter combines the visual and inertial data to produce a more accurate and robust estimate of the robot's motion. The visual information helps in resolving ambiguities in the inertial measurements, while the IMU provides continuous motion data.\n\nPotential challenges arise from poor initial conditions or calibration errors. Poor initial conditions can lead to inaccurate initial estimates, which can propagate and accumulate errors over time. Calibration errors, such as misalignment between the camera and IMU, can introduce systematic biases in the motion estimates. These issues can be exacerbated by sudden changes in the environment or disturbances during operation, which can affect the accuracy of the sensor measurements. To mitigate these challenges, the MSCEqF is designed to handle significant absolute errors and unexpected errors that exceed the prior covariance, ensuring robust performance even under adverse conditions.","source":"data/test/2407.14297.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[133,160,14,9,158,132,134,175,118,173,154,130,172,6,77,78,179,12,17,24,81,119,151,174,177,113,115,16,22,125,180,127,152,128,143,163,116,110,126,157,170,124,146,149,153,162,107,19,72,129,178,73,79,13,75,112,114,176,18,76,145,20,59,148,11,21,90,86,120,5,23,60,117,150,159,69,85,61,92,122,131,8,63,139,161,62,80,171,71,82,10,111,91,93,70,109,121,147,74,169,156,35,84,140,96,135,50,1,15,102,138,141,142,58,94,66,105,44,97,103,54,98,57,144,4,49,53,55,68,155,67,104,65,51,29,83,166,42,56,45,88,123,95,136,46,99,106,25,52,64,137,108,101,89,26,47,100,48,27,164,33,39,40,168,2,7,28,43,36,87,38,32,3,34,37,41,165,31,167,30],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

For rotational calibration states, represented by S ∈ SO(3), the state action ϕ is defined as AᵀSX, where A is a rotation matrix. This indicates that the calibration process involves rotating the system by the inverse of the current rotation (A⁻¹) and then applying the new rotation (A) to the calibration state S. This ensures that the calibration is performed in the correct orientation relative to the new rotation.\n\nFor pose calibration states, represented by S ∈ SE(3), the state action ϕ is defined as C⁻¹SX, where C is a transformation matrix that includes both rotation and translation components.

For rotational calibration, the process focuses on correcting the orientation of the system, ensuring that the navigation system's internal representation matches the external world's orientation. For pose calibration, the process not only corrects the orientation but also the position, ensuring that the system's measurements are accurate in both orientation and location.

It uses a weighted probability distribution over experts, represented by the vector \\( p_m \\). This distribution is updated over time based on the performance of each expert.\n\n2. The selection process is probabilistic, with the probability of selecting expert \\( h_m \\) being \\( \\frac{w_{m, h_m - 1}}{w_{m - 1, h_m - 1}} \\). This means that experts with higher weights have a higher chance of being selected.\n\n3. The algorithm alternates between selecting the expert with the highest weight and selecting from the distribution \\( p_m \\). This introduces diversity in expert selection, potentially allowing the algorithm to explore different experts even if they have lower weights.\n\n4. The probabilistic selection allows for a more nuanced approach to expert choice, potentially leading to better performance by balancing exploitation of known good experts with exploration of potentially better but less certain options.\n\n5. This probabilistic approach differs from standard expert selection methods that typically use a fixed set of experts or a deterministic selection based on current performance metrics.\n\nOverall, line 7 introduces a dynamic and probabilistic expert selection mechanism that aims to balance exploitation and exploration, potentially leading to better performance in online learning scenarios with primary and secondary losses.","source":"data/test/2408.01596.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[311,127,125,110,309,26,298,41,185,214,198,40,161,200,116,299,306,356,137,96,138,140,68,114,27,224,251,115,273,297,354,111,355,112,213,79,167,7,97,291,300,303,312,62,124,288,310,357,95,139,222,287,334,67,289,347,25,230,250,286,352,69,164,168,225,78,144,172,301,23,120,194,342,133,176,8,122,147,149,221,226,278,313,94,113,295,10,11,228,266,323,350,28,150,157,17,126,197,244,302,331,341,82,102,249,246,335,348,90,236,245,6,92,134,142,199,215,235,247,257,268,274,314,333,351,38,109,173,178,186,267,269,5,105,153,174,272,292,315,343,39,83,152,166,263,330,345,89,91,103,121,187,242,101,117,148,171,181,50,93,154,195,252,264,344,76,16,73,146,307,308,158,163,169,229,243,248,279,281,9,49,123,262,63,66,128,189,220,256,304,99,277,346,33,45,81,129,175,294,359,75,85,87,88,100,265,51,183,196,201,261,326,353,15,22,31,180,275,30,104,118,192,254,64,160,237,258,305,328,24,77,135,227,238,285,290,317,340,60,86,119,170,21,36,57,61,132,203,241,324,34,72,131,136,162,20,80,191,193,219,280,370,32,55,84,184,188,284,98,179,182,190,322,363,71,151,282,332,337,74,207,327,159,202,223,349,368,44,177,260,270,14,59,234,296,325,358,37,58,106,156,253,255,276,18,42,210,212,29,56,145,271,321,13,46,108,143,338,365,141,206,293,19,47,259,361,107,375,204,70,165,208,209,217,339,43,283,360,231,329,362,364,1,239,367,35,130,233,54,211,320,372,374,318,373,48,65,316,52,366,2,155,205,218,319,369,371,12,53,216,3,232,336,240,376,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

It introduces the empirical loss bℒneighborhood(G) as the average of 1(NG★(xt) ≠ NG(xt)) over t. This is an unbiased estimate of the true loss, since it directly measures the difference between the true and predicted neighborhoods for each sample.\n\n2. It then shows that bℒneighborhood(G) is bounded by 2k times the sum of Pr(v ∉ NG(xt)) over t, where v is uniformly sampled from NG★(xt). This bound is derived by decomposing the difference in neighborhood sizes into two terms and using the fact that the sum of NG(xt) is bounded by the sum of NG★(xt).\n\n3. The key insight is that this bound can be estimated empirically by sampling uniformly from NG★(xt) and counting the fraction of times v is not in NG(xt). This is possible because the true neighborhood NG★(xt) is known for each sample.\n\n4.

For example, low-income students may have limited resources to retake exams or enroll in additional classes, while wealthier peers have more flexibility. This uneven playing field can lead to unfair outcomes if the learning algorithm doesn't account for these disparities.\n\nSecondly, the unknown manipulation sets make it difficult for the learner to design a strategy-proof mechanism. The learner doesn't know the full range of manipulation strategies that agents might employ, making it challenging to create a predictor that is robust against all possible manipulations.\n\nTo address these challenges, algorithms need to incorporate mechanisms that can adapt to the varying manipulation capabilities of agents. This could involve using more sophisticated learning techniques that can handle uncertainty and learn from the behavior of different socioeconomic groups. Additionally, there may need to be explicit incentives or penalties for manipulation, which could be tailored to the economic constraints faced by different agents.\n\nOverall, designing algorithms that are robust to personalized and unknown manipulation sets requires a nuanced understanding of the socioeconomic landscape and innovative approaches to ensure fairness and effectiveness.","source":"data/test/2408.01596.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[29,19,13,373,18,14,30,74,105,33,369,22,44,104,15,42,16,78,155,32,45,367,2,8,5,59,20,85,221,69,108,188,71,12,43,54,65,368,241,242,61,370,23,31,35,220,21,143,174,64,72,92,109,169,243,364,371,6,62,66,201,355,70,84,177,218,77,83,142,178,217,375,60,113,116,141,222,240,50,75,362,26,34,40,48,90,170,219,47,49,73,106,183,372,25,37,86,107,120,144,149,153,157,286,27,67,93,214,360,365,76,102,118,119,152,39,135,359,374,17,28,53,55,193,278,24,51,79,154,160,265,363,80,91,122,41,234,353,52,57,81,88,205,215,264,341,366,36,128,98,110,187,189,199,361,56,68,111,186,204,212,326,340,343,87,103,124,129,130,159,273,274,7,131,168,196,82,89,95,123,163,185,197,9,11,58,97,134,146,148,208,213,314,94,145,147,283,63,136,202,306,99,101,112,138,156,206,239,246,272,315,121,132,211,223,257,38,133,137,198,318,354,100,200,271,337,356,3,46,139,140,194,210,252,270,96,230,127,175,184,253,266,284,237,244,307,317,114,235,248,345,126,150,267,332,336,4,10,179,191,245,331,125,151,162,173,207,250,279,225,256,323,339,351,164,236,247,262,313,327,328,352,238,287,305,344,350,158,161,165,209,347,1,115,297,304,324,203,229,231,268,276,281,316,322,312,335,346,376,254,260,275,280,299,319,334,342,172,224,226,227,358,195,282,228,249,255,330,117,166,269,349,176,181,251,298,338,348,259,263,309,320,325,357,277,294,300,301,190,293,308,182,303,329,285,321,333,295,310,180,258,289,311,167,290,171,192,292,296,216,233,232,261,302,291,288],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This results in more accurate predictions with less error, especially in scenarios with limited training data.","source":"data/test/2407.10383.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[84,21,85,83,15,86,89,82,69,81,90,145,169,68,104,22,67,73,87,122,143,43,70,98,120,142,168,18,44,66,80,97,116,11,76,195,37,57,74,99,106,160,166,196,56,63,64,65,107,140,199,9,34,118,134,144,59,60,75,79,105,202,5,10,77,102,132,179,188,25,41,147,110,121,123,36,62,100,156,206,214,29,53,88,113,167,207,16,164,189,203,3,19,39,40,58,61,93,94,125,136,139,154,161,209,42,95,96,103,108,117,176,216,4,8,14,20,26,31,32,78,130,155,200,205,210,33,109,197,201,213,35,119,126,138,180,217,218,13,17,38,50,114,124,131,137,204,101,165,171,72,157,163,177,186,46,174,182,185,211,215,54,135,151,153,187,133,192,71,115,175,183,27,158,208,12,45,170,212,111,112,159,190,146,184,6,148,162,198,51,178,47,48,141,181,129,24,150,92,191,52,152,173,30,127,49,28,128,23,193,7,1,55,172,194,91,149,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nHow does the proposed approach handle uncertainty in pedestrian movements when evaluating potential collisions with the robot? Explain the key components of the probabilistic formulation and how it differs from a deterministic collision check.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[100],"raw_output":"","pred":"The proposed approach handles uncertainty in pedestrian movements by using a probabilistic formulation that incorporates stochastic processes to represent future pedestrian positions. This differs from a deterministic collision check in several key ways:\n\n1. Instead of a single predicted position, the approach uses a continuous-time stochastic process to represent the uncertainty in pedestrian movements. This allows for a more nuanced representation of potential future positions.\n\n2. The time-resolution of the pedestrian position forecasts is synchronized with the frequency of collision checks, ensuring that the uncertainty is captured at the appropriate scale.\n\n3. Collision checks are performed using chance constraints, where a collision is assumed if the probability of the robot position being in the collision region exceeds a threshold. This allows for a probabilistic assessment of collision risk.\n\n4. The time-to-collision is defined as the earliest time a collision occurs, considering the probabilistic nature of pedestrian movements. This differs from a deterministic approach that might only consider the closest predicted position.\n\n5. The approach uses a neural network to predict parameters of the stochastic process, conditioned on observed pedestrian motion. This allows for data-driven predictions of future pedestrian behavior.\n\n6. The control problem formulation integrates both predicted stochastic processes and an occupancy map to navigate through dynamic environments, accounting for both pedestrian and static obstacle movements.\n\nOverall, this probabilistic formulation allows for a more robust and flexible approach to collision avoidance, accounting for the inherent uncertainty in pedestrian movements while still enabling efficient navigation.","source":"data/test/2407.10383.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[100,93,102,94,96,17,10,16,109,21,105,99,138,108,144,141,130,27,95,142,104,72,101,118,200,92,107,131,199,136,166,196,114,22,26,197,218,173,203,18,15,106,135,169,170,176,134,193,5,103,121,168,3,81,6,90,167,217,73,89,111,145,208,20,29,75,143,198,24,120,159,171,188,190,155,87,160,163,178,209,214,19,140,215,210,216,88,150,151,202,211,25,30,124,148,13,74,154,186,205,9,122,126,132,133,161,182,207,32,59,76,83,4,12,40,123,146,174,175,206,11,67,84,125,187,113,129,164,86,110,192,35,43,98,195,53,179,194,204,213,41,112,137,172,82,153,189,52,57,23,70,116,152,78,127,156,201,28,66,68,79,128,185,31,71,85,117,157,50,56,63,69,165,177,180,34,49,97,183,184,47,212,7,33,44,64,77,14,39,58,60,147,36,46,8,54,62,139,162,181,51,42,48,65,115,45,80,37,119,191,1,38,149,158,61,2,55,91],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Both methods encode maps as feature vectors of similarities, allowing for flexible representation even with limited training data.  However, k-NN relies on the nearest map for trajectory transfer, potentially leading to biased predictions and overconfidence.  OTNet, on the other hand, considers multiple maps and assigns weights based on their similarity to the target map, enabling it to generate trajectories that are not directly observed in the training dataset.  This allows OTNet to capture diverse motion patterns and generate new trajectories that k-NN cannot, as demonstrated in Figure 6.5.

Firstly, it can expedite the implementation process by leveraging private sector expertise and resources. This partnership can also enhance service quality and innovation, as private companies often have advanced technological capabilities and market-driven strategies. Additionally, it can improve accessibility and affordability of ICT facilities, as private providers may offer cheaper services.\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. One significant concern is the risk of corruption, as highlighted by Participant 2. Private sector involvement could lead to conflicts of interest and potential misuse of public funds. Furthermore, the private sector's focus on profit may prioritize commercial interests over public service needs, potentially compromising the quality and accessibility of e-government services. Additionally, the dependency on private providers could create vulnerabilities in service delivery, especially during economic downturns or crises.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish clear regulations and oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in the partnership.

This indicates that RF achieves relatively low error while also being relatively fast compared to other models.\n\nWhile other models like Decision Trees (DT) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) have lower RMSE scores, they also have higher Time scores. For example, DT has a lower RMSE but a higher Time score than RF. Similarly, kNN has a lower RMSE but a higher Time score than RF.\n\nThe Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models also show lower RMSE scores than RF, but their Time scores are higher. This suggests they may be slower to train or less efficient in terms of computational resources.\n\nOverall, the RF model appears to strike the best balance between achieving low error (RMSE) while also being relatively fast (Time score) across the different subplots shown. This makes it a potentially attractive choice for applications where both accuracy and efficiency are important considerations.","source":"data/test/2407.02706.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[110,106,113,109,105,96,107,198,159,14,108,194,273,104,112,196,199,11,164,111,154,265,268,272,149,156,264,24,136,262,271,119,161,188,138,165,200,222,269,7,168,267,102,270,152,175,263,160,146,266,16,190,15,187,250,25,65,69,148,150,169,64,130,135,162,195,129,197,225,12,41,274,153,186,231,201,145,6,9,17,98,8,81,147,151,82,158,181,254,49,166,97,241,36,42,59,101,125,204,74,115,184,191,170,128,208,236,20,21,27,137,237,5,58,80,118,122,132,143,163,182,218,13,60,92,167,178,193,227,61,155,177,255,37,51,189,215,45,70,134,139,144,28,67,78,103,226,252,33,44,56,89,246,40,202,249,62,71,126,192,29,54,73,83,91,95,185,229,232,258,66,157,251,30,171,248,256,94,114,141,203,219,34,63,72,121,223,242,35,38,140,253,39,57,117,176,230,75,52,87,124,260,2,3,55,243,123,127,205,239,22,23,26,142,179,259,77,19,99,244,85,174,224,257,46,47,79,93,116,212,247,68,180,238,86,120,207,31,32,88,100,209,210,10,234,235,261,48,50,206,211,90,131,183,18,133,245,76,240,214,217,221,84,213,43,173,220,53,172,1,216,233,228,4],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1}]}

Further increasing d to 4 and 8 leads to a sharp increase in MRE.\n\n2. For Lrzip (Figure 5.4b), the relationship is more complex. MRE initially decreases with increasing d, reaching a minimum around d=2. However, further increasing d to 4 and 8 leads to a smaller increase in MRE compared to SQLite.\n\n3. The optimal d value for SQLite is around 2, while for Lrzip it is slightly higher, around 2.5.\n\n4. The range of MRE values for SQLite is much larger than for Lrzip, with SQLite showing a wider spread of MRE values across different d values.\n\n5. The optimal d value for SQLite is more stable across different runs, while for Lrzip there is more variation in the optimal d.\n\n6. The overall MRE for SQLite is higher than for Lrzip, indicating that Lrzip has better performance prediction accuracy.\n\nThese differences suggest that the optimal depth parameter d for handling sample sparsity varies between the two software systems, with SQLite benefiting from a slightly higher d value than Lrzip.

(2021) compare white-box analysis to machine learning for modeling the performance of configurable systems.  White-box analysis, which they term \"white-box analysis over machine learning,\" involves using machine learning to model the performance of configurable systems, but with a focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms and relationships.  This approach allows for greater transparency and interpretability compared to purely black-box machine learning models.\n\nKey differences include:\n\n1. **Interpretability**: White-box analysis provides insights into the specific factors influencing performance, making it easier to understand and explain the model's predictions.  Machine learning models, especially deep neural networks, can be opaque, making it difficult to interpret their decision-making processes.\n\n2. **Explainability**: White-box models can be used to generate explanations for predictions, which is crucial for trust and adoption in many domains.  Machine learning models often lack this capability.\n\n3. **Modeling complexity**: White-box models can capture complex interactions between configuration options, potentially leading to more accurate predictions.  Machine learning models may struggle with capturing intricate relationships without explicit feature engineering.\n\n4. **Debugging and maintenance**: White-box models are easier to debug and maintain, as their structure and relationships are more transparent.  Machine learning models can be harder to troubleshoot and modify.\n\n5. **Scalability**: White-box models may be more scalable for larger systems, as they can be designed to handle the complexity of multiple configuration options.  Machine learning models may become less effective as the number of configuration options increases.\n\nThe potential advantages of white-box analysis include improved trust, better understanding of system behavior, and potentially more accurate predictions for complex systems.

This is calculated by dividing the value-added tax receivables ($64,066) by the total prepaid expenses and other current assets ($103,732), resulting in 0.615 or 61.5%.\n\nIn comparison to the previous year (2022), value-added tax receivables comprised 31.6% of the total prepaid expenses and other current assets.  This is calculated by dividing the value-added tax receivables ($27,928) by the total prepaid expenses and other current assets ($87,489), resulting in 0.316 or 31.6%.\n\nThis significant increase in the percentage of value-added tax receivables from 31.6% in 2022 to 61.5% in 2023 indicates a substantial growth in the company's value-added tax receivables.  This could be due to increased sales or changes in tax regulations that have led to higher tax receivables.  The company's ability to collect these receivables will impact its cash flow and overall financial health.  The substantial increase also suggests that the company may be experiencing growth in its business operations, leading to higher sales and, consequently, higher tax receivables.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FSR_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[93,97,64,77,110,63,68,67,65,74,92,95,96,76,80,59,66,89,106,71,90,84,86,87,103,69,78,105,109,85,107,108,79,111,253,81,48,62,91,70,83,104,17,82,117,143,265,491,75,151,20,47,88,114,126,131,167,443,1,7,99,101,127,267,13,21,128,145,170,273,60,102,289,380,456,113,2,9,364,51,129,173,295,19,24,73,116,139,164,261,269,368,444,494,14,50,56,100,112,245,291,395,473,25,39,58,146,219,247,354,363,369,401,448,457,493,53,94,144,266,285,286,370,454,471,6,98,120,140,147,160,180,184,198,268,366,453,33,282,360,429,442,450,18,34,186,306,308,350,362,365,458,3,22,32,38,149,152,158,165,183,243,271,274,278,280,287,302,351,353,375,445,447,11,162,284,427,452,502,509,8,137,141,205,227,230,234,283,349,389,408,428,434,455,29,36,37,154,156,161,169,174,217,263,275,303,324,345,367,372,381,470,504,31,43,55,123,157,262,279,288,296,336,402,415,440,449,467,490,505,4,5,54,61,121,135,172,178,196,218,225,233,239,259,260,294,300,305,316,317,391,472,41,44,57,132,134,136,163,221,254,257,323,325,424,432,462,492,508,30,35,46,148,153,238,258,276,292,334,355,383,421,425,464,40,125,150,159,181,207,246,272,281,335,377,392,405,416,423,16,52,124,179,212,220,228,290,293,321,358,374,400,439,500,510,45,171,332,409,12,138,241,49,319,359,382,396,431,28,155,226,301,394,10,15,119,277,376,385,426,468,23,130,168,175,177,182,297,299,361,433,348,388,398,460,506,204,210,298,379,441,446,459,166,176,201,213,371,463,466,507,122,224,330,393,397,461,26,42,185,270,337,403,495,208,229,231,264,344,378,384,399,451,27,115,118,320,352,203,331,417,496,199,307,357,373,411,422,142,304,410,240,333,413,206,215,232,256,390,202,318,465,223,242,197,211,476,195,200,419,430,209,501,322,436,498,216,386,214,310,309,356,477,193,222,338,189,469,190,244,312,72,187,248,311,133,339,249,255,346,387,237,188,406,347,480,435,475,474,315,418,503,497,235,326,412,482,250,404,481,511,194,192,236,252,314,329,343,407,414,420,438,489,499,327,485,340,191,313,483,479,488,341,437,487,342,478,484,328,486,251],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Additionally, the company may be subject to other penalties or remedies specified in the Transaction Document.\n\nRegarding Event of Default Notices, the company is obligated to deliver a written notice to the Holder and the Trustee within two Business Days of the occurrence of an Event of Default. This obligation is independent of the Trustee's duty to deliver a similar notice. The notice must include a reasonable description of the Event of Default, a certification as to whether the Event of Default is capable of being cured, and a description of any existing plans to cure the default. If the Event of Default is cured within the specified period, the Holder may still require redemption of the Note, regardless of the cure. This highlights the importance of timely and accurate notification and the potential for redemption even after a cure, emphasizing the company's responsibility to promptly address breaches and communicate effectively with creditors.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FSR_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[143,265,217,177,299,144,266,288,244,257,140,160,322,262,282,158,228,280,218,286,457,166,176,254,415,401,459,164,298,465,141,219,263,451,461,468,135,376,132,277,155,223,221,319,153,258,292,399,136,145,159,220,243,281,428,450,442,208,275,352,460,157,205,279,373,181,267,285,134,163,170,196,224,256,308,432,146,276,391,186,230,241,268,347,364,371,383,382,462,53,137,232,303,385,398,496,211,260,274,291,393,427,139,152,261,169,247,304,494,67,129,154,161,216,229,283,324,455,138,182,201,334,396,464,466,183,377,54,259,321,349,433,389,431,492,209,306,333,380,425,429,184,246,269,305,368,424,472,226,365,400,471,507,83,210,360,384,388,112,156,171,245,278,335,386,394,417,443,469,46,49,293,323,372,379,491,45,114,151,174,222,264,289,336,130,255,374,375,392,470,133,147,296,390,402,416,441,473,234,273,307,325,240,309,318,350,354,430,463,508,98,101,117,142,214,361,395,411,421,453,467,495,32,100,165,185,212,215,227,287,367,24,353,356,369,370,378,381,426,449,493,20,42,51,344,345,351,410,456,490,90,167,187,206,337,355,434,440,116,366,387,162,203,233,284,362,454,37,150,272,359,363,409,239,131,148,301,302,403,439,18,33,50,199,270,458,26,204,253,290,320,30,127,128,149,242,271,446,448,225,502,40,102,110,172,202,294,74,168,179,238,346,357,509,52,84,86,191,207,213,231,313,332,47,76,188,197,504,48,317,2,25,55,75,310,510,19,91,198,66,34,87,189,311,70,316,38,41,97,99,331,348,397,180,200,56,423,452,61,111,173,178,295,300,28,69,444,27,44,93,124,358,4,29,43,113,408,57,22,39,104,447,31,36,88,445,95,107,412,1,35,89,103,109,126,249,3,5,64,85,68,81,94,105,175,297,312,505,59,115,119,474,12,23,190,404,405,413,422,82,96,17,71,123,6,8,118,195,65,120,248,315,338,14,193,235,506,62,121,63,125,237,60,92,194,78,330,106,435,9,21,80,13,58,73,406,501,475,7,122,328,11,480,497,77,251,419,16,72,418,326,108,483,486,10,339,436,498,477,484,503,342,487,79,481,327,500,15,479,482,340,478,437,488,250,476,485,511,192,236,252,314,329,343,407,414,420,438,489,499,341],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target texts:\n\nWhat potential conflict exists between Section 10.16 (Governing Law) and Section 10.18 (Force Majeure), and how might this conflict be resolved in a legal dispute?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[234],"raw_output":"","pred":"Section 10.16 (Governing Law) states that the Indenture and Securities will be governed by New York law, while Section 10.18 (Force Majeure) addresses the Trustee's liability for failures or delays caused by events beyond its control. \n\nThe potential conflict arises because Section 10.18 potentially limits the Trustee's liability for certain events, which could impact the enforceability of the contract under Section 10.16. If the Trustee is not held liable for certain events, it could argue that the contract terms are not being fully enforced.\n\nTo resolve this conflict in a legal dispute, the court would likely consider the intent of the parties and the overall purpose of the contract. The court might interpret Section 10.18 as a limitation on the Trustee's liability for specific events, while still holding the Trustee accountable for breaches of contract under Section 10.16. This would allow the contract to be enforced while acknowledging the Trustee's limited liability for certain unforeseen circumstances. The court would also consider whether the Trustee's liability is limited in a way that would render the contract unenforceable, potentially invalidating the Force Majeure clause.","source":"data/test/NYSE_FSR_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[234,233,336,398,393,197,198,242,291,320,325,352,335,246,292,337,469,169,232,324,160,170,231,282,349,471,463,247,470,323,431,433,399,490,122,245,394,240,430,434,165,229,274,287,318,455,494,308,473,143,186,265,368,166,168,200,243,290,263,366,441,472,54,123,241,432,141,152,158,167,280,351,364,453,46,228,289,468,144,266,319,426,216,219,359,401,157,279,321,370,507,508,140,156,176,211,221,298,302,377,422,159,195,260,281,301,416,424,428,205,238,254,132,151,215,225,357,457,465,179,400,442,171,196,288,446,201,202,230,270,293,408,462,135,137,145,187,226,257,262,267,273,309,402,423,429,456,41,42,212,217,258,286,334,383,451,17,56,155,259,277,331,379,380,396,425,440,452,460,136,148,213,220,285,361,371,417,444,450,44,180,218,278,316,467,32,134,138,177,299,350,353,445,120,133,147,150,163,207,239,248,283,382,427,454,121,153,154,164,255,275,304,332,346,347,395,443,502,48,172,204,269,294,356,372,391,506,142,149,161,209,222,271,317,345,376,378,403,449,466,2,203,224,256,264,305,354,362,363,411,448,458,461,493,116,183,208,223,367,459,491,3,119,129,130,194,272,344,360,365,210,276,373,375,384,464,505,1,43,45,47,139,261,333,374,388,495,22,36,69,125,182,206,227,296,348,118,124,146,174,268,496,51,62,162,284,415,447,127,199,214,322,386,492,504,509,173,295,381,474,6,71,96,109,113,181,20,112,244,369,4,23,53,97,111,126,178,300,385,389,28,74,83,104,185,303,358,390,50,18,40,103,193,307,421,19,27,52,100,30,66,175,297,387,392,37,39,57,510,24,34,60,128,253,355,410,33,35,59,110,114,306,5,58,101,397,439,8,14,26,38,49,108,184,192,236,252,314,329,343,407,414,420,438,489,499,511,55,86,115,117,21,29,31,82,98,131,25,87,409,488,13,80,89,91,93,99,102,479,191,313,11,437,500,67,88,107,487,90,501,75,94,76,61,72,73,95,189,341,328,10,63,77,85,311,12,70,78,64,65,486,92,483,188,251,476,481,338,342,406,436,475,105,106,310,330,79,404,484,16,68,190,312,435,81,235,405,84,7,9,15,478,249,413,497,418,485,237,326,480,412,419,477,315,482,498,327,250,340,339,503],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3 - Partially Correct","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

It suggests that the company's deferred tax assets are becoming more likely to be realized, which can enhance the company's overall financial health. This increase in net deferred income tax assets can provide a buffer against future tax liabilities, potentially reducing the company's tax burden and improving its cash flow.

This action has several potential benefits:\n\n1. **Reduced Interest Costs**: The company will save on interest payments, which can be substantial given the size of the debt.\n2. **Improved Liquidity**: The reduction in debt obligations increases the company's liquidity, providing more financial flexibility for future investments or operational needs.\n3. **Enhanced Credit Rating**: Lower debt levels can improve the company's credit rating, potentially reducing future borrowing costs.\n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks:\n\n1. **Capital Expenditure Impact**: The funds used for repurchasing the notes could have been allocated to capital expenditures, which could have supported growth or innovation.\n2. **Future Financial Flexibility**: While reducing debt improves liquidity, it may limit the company's ability to take on new debt for strategic purposes in the future.\n3. **Market Impact**: The repurchase could be perceived negatively by investors if it is seen as a sign of reduced growth prospects.\n\nIn the future, this strategy could impact the company's financial position by improving its short-term liquidity and reducing interest expenses, but it may also limit its ability to pursue future growth opportunities through debt financing.

Instead, it would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation. This reclassification would have several significant tax consequences:\n\n1. **Loss of REIT Status**: The company would no longer qualify as a REIT, which is a tax-efficient structure for real estate investments. REITs are typically exempt from corporate income tax on their taxable income, but this exemption would be lost.\n\n2. **Corporate Taxation**: The Operating Partnership would be subject to corporate-level taxation on its income, which could significantly reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders.\n\n3. **Distribution Requirements**: To maintain REIT status, the company must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders. If the Operating Partnership were reclassified, the company might face challenges in meeting this requirement due to the reduced cash flow from the partnership.\n\n4. **Capital Gains Tax**: The reclassification could also impact the treatment of capital gains, potentially increasing the tax burden on shareholders.\n\n5. **Taxable Distributions**: The company might be required to make taxable distributions to shareholders to avoid excise taxes, further reducing the available cash for distributions.\n\n6. **Increased Compliance Costs**: The company would need to comply with additional corporate tax regulations, increasing administrative costs.\n\nOverall, such a reclassification would significantly impact the company's ability to distribute income to shareholders and maintain its REIT status, potentially leading to higher tax burdens and reduced shareholder returns.","source":"data/test/NYSE_WSR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[22,21,10,19,88,101,59,81,20,94,102,14,23,26,41,24,43,95,98,9,42,15,64,87,111,109,25,18,96,11,49,37,82,35,79,44,57,39,65,8,38,50,16,47,70,90,53,27,5,36,45,100,117,78,34,71,74,86,55,58,17,69,104,80,62,107,83,77,48,40,92,3,72,85,89,46,7,75,119,84,118,73,61,12,60,105,106,114,110,93,115,97,28,52,116,66,76,108,31,54,30,51,68,112,113,63,33,91,103,29,1,2,67,99,120,32,4,6,56,13],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

These settlements resulted in a significant reduction in the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) from $28.3 million in 2022 to $26.7 million in 2023. Additionally, the actual return on plan assets in 2023 was $0.6 million, which contributed to the change in the funded status.\n\nThe impact of these factors on the overall financial position of the pension plan was substantial. The reduction in the ABO and the settlement of liabilities through lump-sum payments and annuity purchases improved the funded status of the pension plan, moving it from a deficit of $16.9 million in 2022 to a deficit of $6.4 million in 2023. This improvement in funded status reduced the net pension liability asset, which was $16.9 million in 2022 and decreased to $6.4 million in 2023.

Smith Corporation. The Smith Family, through their voting trust, controls approximately 96.9% of the voting power of the company's Class A Common Stock and 66.2% of the total voting power, including both classes of stock. This concentration of voting power gives the Smith Family the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including amendments to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws and transactions involving a change of control.\n\nFor minority shareholders, this structure presents several risks. They have limited influence over corporate decisions, which can lead to a lack of representation and potentially adverse outcomes for their interests. The Smith Family's ability to maintain control even if some members decide to transfer their shares through the voting trust agreement further consolidates their power.\n\nHowever, this structure also presents potential benefits. The Smith Family's strong control ensures stability and continuity in corporate governance, which can be beneficial for the company's long-term success.

For claims covered by insurance, such as auto, workers compensation, and general liability in the U.S., the company relies on outside insurance companies and third-party claims administrators to assist in establishing individual claim reserves. An independent outside actuary provides estimates of ultimate projected losses, including incurred but not reported claims, which are used to establish reserves for losses. This approach leverages external expertise and standardized processes to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\nFor other types of claims, reserves are established when payment is considered probable and are based on advice from internal and external counsel and historical settlement information. This method relies more heavily on internal expertise and historical data to estimate potential costs, as the company does not have the same level of external assistance as with insurance claims.\n\nThe difference in methodology reflects the varying levels of control and predictability associated with different types of claims. Insurance claims are more predictable and can be managed through established processes, while other claims require more subjective judgment and historical analysis.","source":"data/test/NYSE_HI_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[118,81,117,32,45,61,98,25,17,101,128,129,51,52,106,121,95,97,53,103,12,46,62,13,68,75,77,112,127,122,125,8,82,11,23,93,26,91,33,44,76,134,2,66,1,20,21,4,72,87,22,73,131,74,99,135,89,126,5,15,48,9,100,114,65,132,79,43,10,80,70,85,42,58,19,34,14,49,36,47,50,119,40,41,104,96,105,83,84,110,54,102,107,57,124,31,37,39,60,35,56,27,30,38,92,111,71,63,90,109,113,59,123,6,55,86,78,88,115,24,94,116,69,29,28,16,67,120,7,108,3,64,18,133,130],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

The rabbi trust assets would be used to cover this obligation, but only after all other secured and unsecured creditors have been paid. This means that if the company's other liabilities exceed the value of the rabbi trust assets, the deferred compensation liability would not be fully covered, potentially leaving participants with no compensation.\n\nFurthermore, the company's ability to pay interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense) would be severely impacted, as these are evaluated on a consolidated basis and not allocated to the business segments.

This approach helps ensure that executives are motivated to make decisions that support the company's sustainability goals and financial stability over the long term.\n\nOverall, these measures contribute to Encompass Health's sustainability strategy by fostering a culture of performance and accountability, while also incentivizing leadership to focus on both financial success and broader societal impacts.","source":"data/test/NYSE_EHC_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,29,52,10,30,11,12,47,177,9,31,93,208,210,218,7,36,61,169,5,88,187,155,174,219,190,196,216,1,72,80,92,109,186,194,81,141,188,192,221,8,172,189,197,222,184,201,28,87,139,217,62,191,203,214,2,120,209,211,173,193,207,176,178,199,200,17,34,78,82,185,213,16,175,183,198,215,48,180,182,202,212,148,179,19,195,204,13,166,59,205,27,3,206,53,75,98,181,84,49,56,94,97,51,50,54,77,99,118,133,33,66,142,58,96,23,60,70,38,76,95,164,154,146,150,152,42,144,32,46,115,135,151,35,22,67,116,136,89,100,117,140,18,123,25,71,104,57,63,132,24,73,111,101,157,55,153,161,40,83,128,4,43,90,121,127,143,149,159,162,39,74,103,114,125,138,160,37,110,107,129,41,156,45,21,44,102,106,130,20,68,108,119,122,64,126,14,171,105,113,134,170,65,145,69,85,86,91,131,220,79,124,147,112,167,165,163,168,26,137,15,158],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

A rising interest rate environment would increase the cost of their variable-rate debt, potentially leading to higher interest expense and reduced profitability.  Conversely, a falling interest rate environment could lower their interest expense, improving profitability.\n\nHowever, HHH mitigates some of this risk through derivative instruments.  They have interest rate swaps, caps, and collars in place, which can help stabilize their interest costs.  These derivatives are recorded on a gross basis at fair value on the balance sheet and are designated as cash flow hedges.  The change in the fair value of these derivatives is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings within the same income statement line item being hedged.\n\nHHH also faces credit risk from derivative counterparties, but mitigates this by reviewing the creditworthiness of these counterparties and entering into agreements with credit-worthy institutions.  Overall, while HHH is exposed to interest rate risk, their use of derivatives provides some protection against significant changes in the interest rate environment.

This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in average sales transaction value due to increased promotional activity, partially offset by an increase in PLCC Funds.\n\n2. **Cost of Goods Sold**: Cost of goods sold decreased by $28.5 million, or 3.7%, from $759.8 million in fiscal year 2021 to $691.3 million in fiscal year 2022. This reduction was due to lower inventory purchases and a decrease in inventory purchases.\n\n3. **Gross Profit**: Gross profit decreased by $78.4 million, or 14.5%, from $537.4 million in fiscal year 2021 to $459.0 million in fiscal year 2022. This decrease was primarily due to lower net sales and higher cost of goods sold.\n\n4. **Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses**: These expenses decreased by $141.5 million, or 32.4%, from $439.4 million in fiscal year 2021 to $300.0 million in fiscal year 2022. This decrease was due to lower store and e-commerce payroll costs, lower share-based compensation expense, and lower losses on property and equipment disposals.\n\n5. **Marketing Expenses**: Marketing expenses decreased by $7.3 million, or 13.9%, from $52.7 million in fiscal year 2021 to $45.4 million in fiscal year 2022. This decrease was due to lower television marketing, regional marketing events, and direct mail program spend.\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to a significant decrease in net income from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2023, with net income decreasing from $29.9 million to $50.2 million. The overall financial performance was negatively impacted by the reduction in net sales and gross profit, while the decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses and marketing expenses helped mitigate some of the negative effects.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[51,49,48,43,47,50,90,44,72,26,70,54,82,97,69,2,52,77,88,91,66,86,80,73,81,55,53,75,78,65,13,95,29,67,74,14,92,96,8,34,84,68,93,32,94,98,41,46,56,60,76,39,79,33,62,89,71,6,9,99,18,19,21,87,31,64,12,45,61,30,25,83,85,3,23,35,58,22,59,16,5,27,37,100,110,38,57,40,42,1,28,104,7,36,101,107,20,15,24,106,103,11,4,108,109,102,105,10,17,63],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The number of active customers increased from 3,821 to 3,761, a slight decrease of 1.5%. This suggests that while the company has maintained a stable customer base, there may be some churn or customer attrition. Net sales per active customer, however, decreased from $340 to $306, a decline of 10.6%. This indicates that existing customers are purchasing less per transaction, which could be due to various factors such as changes in consumer behavior, increased competition, or economic conditions.\n\nThese trends might impact the company's strategic decisions in several ways. The slight decrease in active customers could prompt the company to focus on customer retention strategies, such as loyalty programs or improved customer service. The decline in net sales per active customer might lead to a review of pricing strategies, product offerings, or marketing efforts to encourage higher spending per customer. Additionally, the company might consider investing in new marketing channels or customer engagement initiatives to counteract the downward trend in sales per customer. Overall, the company needs to analyze these trends further to understand the underlying causes and develop targeted strategies to address them.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[43,47,49,45,21,79,81,51,95,32,89,2,62,52,67,64,93,66,82,94,56,41,78,44,83,65,12,80,91,39,90,61,96,72,88,42,46,99,40,69,73,29,16,86,97,98,34,70,5,48,11,13,68,76,6,28,53,33,100,104,84,8,50,14,54,58,60,74,3,24,77,19,92,22,59,9,35,38,57,71,26,85,55,75,37,20,23,25,27,31,103,107,18,10,15,30,63,87,7,101,106,110,36,1,105,17,4,108,102,109],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Enhanced comparability: By recording PLCC Funds as net sales rather than a reduction in SG&A expenses, the company's financial statements will be more comparable to those of many industry peers. This could make it easier to analyze and compare performance metrics.\n\n2. Greater transparency: The new policy provides greater transparency into the gross impact of PLCC Funds, showing them as a direct revenue component rather than an expense reduction. This could be beneficial for investors and analysts seeking clearer insights into the company's revenue streams.\n\n3. Potential distortions: However, this change could also introduce distortions in financial performance analysis. For example, it might exaggerate revenue growth if PLCC Funds are substantial, or mask underlying SG&A inefficiencies if the company is heavily reliant on these funds.\n\n4. Impact on ratios: The change could affect key financial ratios like gross margin, SG&A expense ratios, and operating margins, making them less comparable to industry peers.\n\n5. Potential for manipulation: There's a risk that the company could manipulate PLCC Funds to boost reported revenue or earnings, which could mislead investors.\n\n6. Increased complexity: The change could make financial statements more complex to analyze, requiring more careful scrutiny of the accounting policies and footnotes.\n\nOverall, while the new policy enhances comparability and transparency, it introduces potential risks of distortion and manipulation that need to be carefully considered in financial analysis.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[69,46,49,47,29,34,26,19,30,32,20,37,45,21,25,8,27,31,43,22,35,18,9,60,16,76,81,54,70,90,95,28,23,78,36,92,33,53,44,55,15,75,3,24,51,68,2,11,59,58,62,99,13,56,71,77,96,39,86,12,48,50,7,67,72,57,41,84,87,52,38,97,104,85,98,14,74,83,103,40,42,73,80,82,91,10,66,88,6,101,64,79,93,63,89,61,105,109,65,5,94,106,100,107,1,4,108,110,17,102],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This difference stems from the nature of the awards and their impact on the company's financial statements.\n\nThe pre-IPO incentive units were intended to provide profit-sharing opportunities to management rather than equity ownership.  They lacked voting rights, distribution rights, and were subject to repurchase by Torrid Holding LLC upon termination.  The fair value of these units was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, but the settlement amounts were at the discretion of the Board.  These characteristics led to their classification as liabilities.\n\nIn contrast, the post-IPO share-based compensation plans, including RSUs and PSUs, were designed to provide equity ownership to employees.  They granted the right to receive shares of common stock upon vesting, subject to continued employment or service.  These plans were accounted for as equity instruments because they provided a direct economic benefit to the recipients.\n\nThe change in accounting treatment reflects the shift from profit-sharing incentives to equity-based compensation following the IPO, which allowed Torrid to better align employee interests with shareholder value.  The pre-IPO incentive units were a legacy of Torrid Holding LLC's ownership structure, while the post-IPO plans were part of Torrid's new corporate governance and compensation framework.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CURV_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[92,77,76,90,60,68,91,96,59,66,67,84,55,69,72,50,70,86,41,2,82,65,52,104,85,51,61,13,48,75,49,62,43,10,11,64,35,103,5,44,58,47,3,15,78,88,95,34,46,54,6,53,56,57,106,73,93,28,45,74,40,29,32,80,83,110,81,87,94,1,22,101,33,39,97,8,12,14,19,71,89,38,99,16,9,21,7,25,18,42,79,98,26,31,23,36,30,105,37,24,27,20,100,107,102,63,109,4,108,17],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This model allows for localized, customer-focused marketing and installation, which can be more efficient and effective than a direct sales force.\n\n2. **Origination, Installation, Monitoring, and Servicing Processes**: The streamlined approach for origination and installation, along with monitoring and servicing processes, likely contributes to the ease of customer acquisition and retention.\n\n3. **Sustainable Home Product Offerings**: The expansion of sustainable home product offerings, including non-solar financing, enhances the company's differentiation from competitors and attracts a broader customer base.\n\n4. **Governmental Incentives**: The availability of various governmental incentives for the renewable energy industry likely plays a significant role in driving customer interest and adoption.\n\n5. **Brand, Innovation, and Execution**: The company's brand, innovation, and focused execution have driven significant growth in market share and customer base.\n\n6. **Tax Equity Arrangements**: The company's ability to enter into leases with third-party owners of solar energy systems and assume related obligations, entitling it to future customer cash flows and incentives, further enhances its long-term contracted cash flows and business model.\n\nThese factors, combined with the company's strategic focus on growth and operational efficiency, have contributed to the substantial increase in the number of customers over the four-year period.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NOVA_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[7,66,21,80,58,68,78,144,79,110,22,24,33,72,30,73,91,88,20,142,4,34,40,141,115,11,103,63,64,65,117,118,119,26,84,113,17,45,23,85,106,13,81,97,62,9,99,105,18,74,83,3,25,100,143,95,101,120,136,61,94,104,27,107,112,147,44,77,93,137,108,6,111,49,146,29,32,41,35,36,69,67,5,116,139,153,134,149,16,28,70,87,154,52,71,133,148,38,50,75,53,51,55,46,47,122,1,37,39,90,102,125,145,60,127,48,135,151,54,109,124,140,19,128,31,59,43,10,15,96,129,138,56,57,82,98,14,42,126,86,114,150,8,76,89,123,12,131,160,162,132,159,158,2,161,130,155,152,157,164,121,156,163,92],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

If net metering policies are altered, such as reducing the value of credits customers receive for excess energy, it could lead to a decrease in demand for solar energy systems. This reduction in demand could result in lower origination rates for new solar service agreements, directly impacting the company's growth trajectory.\n\nFurthermore, changes in financial incentives, such as rebates, tax credits, and other financial mechanisms, could reduce the attractiveness of solar energy systems to potential customers. This reduction in attractiveness could further diminish demand and negatively affect the company's ability to maintain competitive pricing. As a result, the company might need to adjust its pricing strategies, potentially increasing prices to offset lower demand, which could negatively impact its market share and customer base.\n\nOverall, these regulatory and policy changes could create a volatile environment for the company, making it challenging to predict future performance and growth.

{"question":"What was the percentage change in the total shareholders' equity from 2022 to 2023, and what factors might have contributed to this change?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[7],"raw_output":"","pred":"The total shareholders' equity increased by approximately 7.4% from 2022 to 2023.  This growth can be attributed to several factors:\n\n1. **Net Income**: The company reported a net income of $171.2 million in 2023, which is a decrease of 24.2% from 2022.  While net income is a significant contributor to shareholders' equity, the decrease in net income alone does not fully explain the increase in equity.\n\n2. **Retained Earnings**: The retained earnings increased from $2,055,912 in 2022 to $2,107,569 in 2023, a 2.5% increase.  Retained earnings are a key component of shareholders' equity and represent the portion of net income that is reinvested in the business rather than distributed as dividends.\n\n3. **Capital Surplus**: The capital surplus increased from $620,578 in 2022 to $636,422 in 2023, a 2.6% increase.  Capital surplus is another component of shareholders' equity and reflects the excess of the company's assets over its liabilities.\n\n4. **Treasury Stock**: The treasury stock decreased from $1,105,419 in 2022 to $1,113,644 in 2023, a slight increase of 0.7%.  While treasury stock is not directly part of shareholders' equity, its decrease indicates that the company did not repurchase as many shares in 2023 as in 2022.\n\n5. **Other Comprehensive Income**: The accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased from $434,658 in 2022 to $396,688 in 2023, a 8.7% decrease.  This improvement in other comprehensive income positively impacted shareholders' equity.\n\nOverall, the increase in retained earnings, capital surplus, and the decrease in treasury stock, along with the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, contributed to the growth in total shareholders' equity from 2022 to 2023.","source":"data/test/NYSE_BOH_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[7,29,4,3,9,5,2,6,28,35,20,21,31,19,1,18,12,17,11,15,16,14,13,10,36,8,33,30,34,23,22,25,27,32,24,26],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

What factors might have driven this change, and what are the potential financial reporting implications of this shift?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[99],"raw_output":"","pred":"Oscar Health shifted its reinsurance accounting from deposit accounting to quota share reinsurance accounting in 2023. This change was driven by the termination of a 2022 quota share reinsurance contract and the establishment of a new quota share arrangement for the 2023 policy year. The new arrangement is accounted for under quota share reinsurance accounting.\n\nThe potential financial reporting implications of this shift are significant. By moving to quota share reinsurance accounting, Oscar Health can better manage its risk exposure and potentially reduce its capital requirements. This is because quota share reinsurance agreements typically involve the reinsurer assuming a specified percentage of the ceding company's losses, which can help stabilize earnings and reduce volatility. Additionally, quota share agreements often include ceding commissions, which can offset administrative costs.\n\nHowever, this shift also introduces complexity in the accounting treatment of reinsurance premiums and claims. Oscar Health must now account for the premiums ceded and claims assumed under the new arrangement, which could affect its reported revenue, expenses, and overall financial position. The company must carefully monitor the performance of these reinsurance agreements to ensure they meet its risk management objectives and financial targets.","source":"data/test/NYSE_OSCR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[71,63,33,118,94,65,84,64,89,13,16,8,49,81,85,25,130,18,72,74,62,109,87,121,32,120,122,3,86,7,9,98,119,126,127,91,19,88,4,5,76,78,69,92,110,12,95,6,50,75,40,73,96,1,17,48,15,30,53,125,41,24,77,128,10,66,54,28,68,67,20,38,100,31,47,56,82,105,114,113,29,107,131,60,70,99,37,58,102,106,11,42,111,115,14,123,124,97,21,35,39,55,34,44,61,117,43,79,45,116,104,27,93,132,2,101,26,52,46,83,57,108,36,59,103,23,112,22,51,129,90,80],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

The timing of resolution for these uncertainties is unknown, but the company does not anticipate a material change in UTBs within the next 12 months.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MTDR_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[188,127,170,2,40,120,126,161,197,32,203,171,28,33,116,118,187,190,206,39,176,38,37,175,195,198,29,31,108,212,82,90,162,173,179,199,200,30,57,167,21,34,211,41,160,163,177,131,172,191,201,213,166,202,18,36,164,193,25,26,3,24,54,178,49,121,128,35,194,19,99,192,16,180,22,97,123,129,135,205,60,130,184,93,111,149,165,23,44,112,113,114,124,125,146,189,59,155,214,20,117,174,46,17,47,87,137,156,5,65,78,169,71,4,110,115,183,196,133,8,182,7,185,217,14,61,84,119,136,145,181,62,140,147,186,204,132,15,67,73,122,53,56,58,74,76,138,150,168,55,68,96,101,13,27,109,51,70,139,63,66,72,142,152,6,11,64,81,157,158,134,50,95,43,85,148,88,9,91,210,154,45,98,144,69,143,159,48,52,77,79,92,10,89,107,209,141,218,104,151,105,207,42,1,103,208,12,102,100,86,83,80,94,153,75,106,215,216],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

These items are added back to net income to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nIn contrast, when reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, the company includes interest expense, net of non-cash portion, current income tax provision, and other non-cash and non-recurring expense (income). These items are subtracted from net cash provided by operating activities to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nThe key difference is that the reconciliation to Net Income focuses on adjusting net income for non-cash expenses and gains/losses, while the reconciliation to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities focuses on adjusting net cash provided by operating activities for interest expense, taxes, and other non-cash items. This distinction reflects the different perspectives and purposes of these reconciliations, with the former providing a clearer view of operating performance and the latter offering insights into cash flow generation.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MTDR_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[126,212,213,120,123,127,163,211,124,171,178,179,90,214,149,166,172,34,118,72,82,176,130,180,145,170,28,140,161,188,202,16,156,167,196,204,60,114,146,174,192,198,2,116,128,147,164,190,200,18,108,160,112,162,20,22,206,66,131,4,19,148,26,32,136,182,36,109,142,144,184,40,177,201,113,138,30,155,96,165,46,24,119,194,17,84,168,210,74,158,64,68,110,197,70,117,38,111,185,85,125,209,122,217,11,15,205,5,27,50,115,135,181,8,78,102,121,129,87,183,14,137,199,37,41,54,98,62,88,35,133,58,104,186,3,29,169,173,191,195,134,157,189,25,65,175,21,31,71,86,132,154,193,203,7,48,52,56,76,187,218,23,44,57,208,33,94,152,42,80,39,69,99,77,100,55,67,207,12,13,1,47,59,91,93,97,9,73,139,63,92,81,150,43,151,159,53,6,105,106,143,79,107,75,83,101,51,216,49,89,153,45,95,103,10,141,61,215],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

However, the geopolitical disruption would likely lead to supply chain disruptions and increased costs for services, materials, and equipment, particularly for drilling and completion activities.  This could offset some of the revenue gains, potentially leading to lower profitability.\n\nThe company's financial strategy would likely shift to focus on securing stable and reliable supplies of raw materials and services.  This could involve increasing reliance on long-term contracts and strategic partnerships to ensure consistent access to necessary inputs.  Additionally, the company might explore diversification strategies, such as expanding into alternative energy sources or diversifying its geographic operations, to mitigate the risks associated with geopolitical instability.

The company's ability to maintain and even surpass the performance of broader market indices indicates a strong financial health and growth potential, which could be attributed to its focus on quality products, efficient operations, and strategic market positioning.","source":"data/test/NYSE_DOOR_2023.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[34,38,108,20,39,55,9,36,11,19,6,40,52,13,51,112,43,53,62,111,116,3,37,82,114,50,96,1,81,21,47,15,48,93,127,115,117,128,12,121,44,104,60,131,132,122,130,49,129,133,16,123,125,26,41,42,61,126,63,14,7,59,10,25,45,106,28,58,79,24,8,23,88,46,120,30,4,105,124,5,29,86,67,72,76,102,57,56,66,75,83,69,119,2,64,35,22,80,73,18,33,92,103,54,97,27,65,68,78,94,31,70,84,98,101,137,85,17,100,32,136,118,113,74,91,109,90,107,77,99,89,87,134,110,71,135,95],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This decrease in net income significantly impacted the equity, reducing it from $742,782,000 to $859,328,000. Additionally, the company repurchased and retired common shares, which further decreased equity by $34,172,000. The accumulated other comprehensive loss also contributed to the decrease, increasing from $(142,224,000) to $(120,192,000).\n\nDespite these negative factors, the company's total assets increased from $2,248,178,000 to $2,685,379,000, primarily due to the acquisition of Endura and Fleetwood, which added $248,100,000 to net sales and $280,000,000 to total assets. The increase in total assets was partially offset by the decrease in equity, resulting in a net increase in total liabilities and equity from $2,248,178,000 to $2,685,379,000.

In contrast, the Building Materials index started at $100 and peaked at $206 in August 2022, showing a significant rise before declining to $205 by August 2023.\n\nSeveral factors could contribute to these differences. Acuity's performance might be influenced by its strategic focus on lighting and electrical components, which could have been less affected by broader market fluctuations. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to changing market demands, such as the shift towards sustainable and energy-efficient products, could have positively impacted its stock performance.\n\nOn the other hand, the Building Materials index's peak in 2022 could be attributed to the strong demand for construction materials during that period, driven by infrastructure projects and residential construction. However, the subsequent decline might be due to economic uncertainties, such as rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions, which could have negatively impacted the construction sector and, consequently, the building materials industry.\n\nOverall, Acuity's more stable performance suggests a stronger market position and strategic resilience, while the Building Materials index's volatile performance reflects the industry's sensitivity to economic cycles and external factors.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AYI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[20,32,60,43,62,21,22,51,52,6,31,40,48,59,74,54,61,75,46,63,76,34,38,47,57,73,44,64,66,71,56,69,70,7,45,68,72,35,41,1,24,39,42,53,55,67,58,248,37,244,36,79,84,260,3,82,23,261,2,85,97,246,25,151,19,65,235,77,237,80,50,86,141,83,18,112,258,158,200,129,4,81,217,27,175,8,30,29,90,150,249,161,254,12,115,184,203,9,138,226,94,187,252,253,256,257,17,49,91,251,26,255,152,164,250,33,95,118,5,96,229,10,206,259,247,98,106,13,28,139,145,245,99,240,143,153,16,185,142,239,14,166,213,227,15,107,120,188,210,125,204,92,171,89,78,116,168,103,133,167,205,111,162,170,212,215,218,121,122,123,127,130,173,176,202,211,93,100,119,124,135,159,160,165,179,180,181,221,114,222,223,157,216,102,117,146,148,169,174,186,189,198,231,241,110,132,134,136,163,11,128,156,178,199,208,209,220,225,104,154,182,238,101,108,109,155,172,177,196,197,230,144,192,147,190,219,224,126,207,131,183,193,140,233,137,242,214,195,236,113,149,228,87,201,232,105,194,191,243,234,88],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

For the domestic plans, the allocation of fixed income securities decreased from 61.2% in 2022 to 75.0% in 2023. This increase suggests a shift towards higher-risk investments, potentially in anticipation of higher returns or due to changes in market conditions.

This substantial increase in fixed income securities might be due to a desire for stability and lower volatility in the investment portfolio.

The shift towards fixed income securities in both domestic and international plans might be aimed at managing risk and ensuring a more stable return on investment.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AYI_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[67,68,70,66,76,74,16,41,51,58,60,75,56,42,71,8,50,12,47,21,69,46,13,24,25,48,57,53,29,43,49,132,178,59,17,35,45,220,23,77,79,4,54,200,65,14,19,37,22,30,32,40,78,143,216,26,100,112,44,84,128,168,174,235,6,122,5,33,62,73,189,236,27,129,215,31,36,72,113,127,148,159,239,34,52,64,80,147,175,217,38,81,192,213,196,238,130,153,176,15,173,210,92,97,99,109,125,155,171,63,85,144,145,172,179,201,218,28,83,133,150,240,247,2,61,111,126,141,157,252,256,9,55,86,91,188,193,197,208,214,221,222,223,251,18,93,103,135,154,232,244,254,82,101,107,164,167,177,181,227,231,253,1,10,20,108,131,190,233,118,121,124,219,242,250,257,102,134,170,185,229,258,104,120,139,158,180,202,204,207,248,259,89,114,123,156,160,166,199,249,98,106,212,187,206,243,255,110,116,119,162,191,7,11,39,90,138,151,169,198,246,184,228,94,96,146,163,241,117,205,209,211,165,186,203,3,115,226,161,237,137,136,142,183,140,182,194,224,225,95,230,234,105,149,195,261,245,152,260,88,87],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Additionally, there were additions for tax positions of prior years, contributing $1.4 million in 2023, compared to $0.1 million in 2022 and $0.1 million in 2021.\n\nHowever, these increases were offset by reductions due to settlements and the lapse of the statute of limitations.

Several factors could have contributed to this performance difference:\n\n1. **COVID-19 Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the construction industry, leading to reduced demand for lighting and building materials. Acuity Brands, being a major player in the building materials sector, likely faced more immediate and severe challenges during this period.\n\n2. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The pandemic also caused supply chain disruptions, which could have affected Acuity Brands more severely due to its reliance on global supply chains. This could have led to higher costs and delays in production and delivery.\n\n3. **Market Sentiment**: The broader market sentiment during the pandemic may have been more negative for building materials, as the construction sector was one of the hardest hit. Investors may have been more cautious about the sector's future prospects.\n\n4. **Strategic Decisions**: Acuity Brands may have made strategic decisions that negatively impacted its performance during this period. For example, if they invested heavily in new technologies or expansion plans that did not align with the market's immediate needs.\n\n5. **Competitive Landscape**: The company's competitive landscape may have changed, with competitors potentially gaining market share or introducing innovative products that Acuity Brands did not match.\n\n6. **Financial Position**: Acuity Brands' financial position, including debt levels and cash reserves, could have played a role. If they were more heavily leveraged, they may have been more vulnerable to market downturns.\n\nThese factors combined likely contributed to the observed performance difference between Acuity Brands, Inc. and the Dow Jones U.S. Building Materials & Fixtures Index.","source":"data/test/NYSE_AYI_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[20,6,21,51,52,22,40,31,41,59,74,32,39,60,69,73,75,3,43,55,62,4,70,44,46,48,63,76,38,47,56,54,61,66,57,68,72,34,53,71,83,246,18,67,248,25,35,42,82,84,85,1,2,7,24,37,58,23,36,50,64,8,12,79,45,244,260,261,16,5,86,141,13,235,9,77,80,200,10,29,19,49,112,65,153,161,237,17,97,158,203,33,81,115,129,184,94,175,90,138,217,258,30,150,26,27,226,247,151,249,187,91,15,164,206,259,14,118,254,252,256,152,253,251,255,257,139,185,96,99,227,229,250,95,245,222,93,106,134,180,240,89,124,162,170,225,100,116,212,107,155,204,210,213,239,109,143,92,120,126,136,145,166,171,174,188,197,208,216,125,128,160,173,186,202,215,28,98,127,148,154,196,11,108,114,172,189,205,182,198,218,159,214,104,121,130,132,133,140,142,176,178,221,224,78,123,167,209,220,103,135,144,156,168,179,193,101,110,122,181,190,211,223,102,169,199,228,117,119,146,163,165,147,183,195,137,177,192,111,194,207,219,131,149,157,238,241,242,236,233,105,113,243,231,201,230,191,232,87,234,88],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This indicates that the company's reliance on related parties has decreased over these years.\n\nThe decreasing reliance on related parties could suggest several things. Firstly, the company might be diversifying its revenue sources, reducing its dependence on transactions with related parties. Secondly, it could be improving its operational efficiency and reducing costs, leading to a lower proportion of related party transactions in total revenues.

Firstly, there are fees associated with the ADSs, including a $0.00015 per ADS annual fee and a $0.00015 per ADS transaction fee. These fees can accumulate over time, reducing the investor's returns.\n\nAdditionally, there are currency conversion fees when converting Renminbi (RMB) to U.S. dollars. These fees can be substantial, especially when converting large amounts of RMB to U.S. dollars. The conversion rate fluctuates based on the People's Bank of China's rates, which can lead to unpredictable losses or gains for investors.\n\nFurthermore, there are fees associated with the ADSs, such as a $0.00015 per ADS annual fee and a $0.00015 per ADS transaction fee. These fees can add up over time, reducing the investor's returns.\n\nThe overall value of the investment can be significantly impacted by these fees and currency conversion costs. For example, if an investor converts a large amount of RMB to U.S. dollars, the fees and currency conversion costs can significantly reduce the value of the investment. Additionally, fluctuations in the exchange rate can further impact the value of the investment, potentially leading to losses or gains depending on the direction of the exchange rate.\n\nIn summary, investors holding ADSs should be aware of the fees and currency conversion costs associated with their investment, as these can significantly impact the overall value of their investment.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMCM_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[48,55,52,126,51,119,127,175,9,10,4,177,33,123,174,169,15,124,122,159,162,203,28,200,27,47,38,8,50,54,125,56,57,118,163,44,204,170,11,17,142,164,168,176,167,189,196,35,121,130,165,197,145,161,115,120,179,207,173,158,37,148,202,157,178,160,166,172,149,150,151,186,22,191,16,93,147,188,199,12,180,194,152,192,39,190,206,154,182,156,181,187,205,21,36,88,184,18,25,32,193,195,201,40,153,171,42,198,41,1,63,34,46,146,155,183,31,104,29,106,20,24,114,62,143,26,49,105,19,67,81,185,45,91,30,92,267,102,103,248,58,76,258,2,131,23,86,97,5,87,111,66,109,80,82,84,98,117,53,70,85,101,257,61,59,64,133,256,65,100,129,268,220,230,241,3,128,221,247,95,289,290,68,75,78,99,132,269,94,210,250,282,209,271,281,43,60,110,211,240,249,278,288,71,108,219,265,279,83,141,229,291,116,266,69,89,90,112,264,138,259,285,232,212,218,270,74,293,238,231,77,96,107,251,7,134,135,216,233,79,213,260,73,239,286,223,292,136,208,237,246,255,13,113,252,284,14,217,222,243,6,72,228,234,273,283,272,242,287,137,263,262,277,144,245,275,280,214,139,294,236,224,253,215,235,140,227,261,226,254,276,244,274,225],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

{"question":"What engineering challenges might be presented by the shape of the dam as shown in the image, particularly in managing water flow and pressure?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[5],"raw_output":"","pred":"The dam's curved shape presents several engineering challenges related to water flow and pressure management. The curved surface creates a complex geometry that affects the distribution of water pressure across the dam's face. This can lead to uneven stress distribution, which requires careful design to ensure structural integrity and prevent cracking or failure.\n\nThe curvature also impacts the flow dynamics of the water as it passes through the dam. The shape can create turbulence and eddies, which can affect the efficiency of water flow and potentially lead to erosion or sediment buildup. This requires precise engineering to manage the flow and minimize these effects.\n\nAdditionally, the curved shape can influence the stability of the dam, particularly during high water levels or extreme weather conditions. The curvature may affect the dam's ability to withstand hydrostatic pressure and prevent seepage, which can lead to erosion and undermine the dam's stability.\n\nTo address these challenges, engineers must carefully analyze the hydrostatic pressures, flow dynamics, and stability of the dam. This typically involves using advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and finite element analysis (FEA) to model the behavior of water and the dam under various conditions. The goal is to ensure that the dam can safely and efficiently manage water flow while maintaining structural integrity and stability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_NWE_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[6,1,5,3,54,8,7,43,24,41,2,40,45,9,23,129,86,4,10,127,138,38,21,11,37,55,74,39,46,44,88,33,42,14,18,53,104,105,68,27,51,99,22,56,128,28,125,32,76,101,25,70,26,36,57,110,12,17,29,75,87,108,102,118,16,71,85,94,103,30,47,20,107,120,123,61,73,84,13,31,67,78,111,79,119,34,49,81,96,63,113,60,97,100,72,95,109,115,83,48,65,69,98,112,124,126,15,64,121,130,137,52,82,92,77,19,35,66,80,50,117,122,62,114,131,116,133,136,58,59,106,89,135,91,132,134,93,90],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

However, this decrease was partially offset by foreign deferred tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nDespite the decrease in Shareholders' net income, Adjusted income from operations increased in 2023.

The chloride process uses chlorine to extract rutile TiO2 from slag or rutile ore, producing less waste and requiring less energy than the sulfate process. It is more labor-intensive but offers higher skill requirements. The chloride process is preferred for coatings and plastics due to its blueish undertone and is the preferred form for these large end-use markets. \n\nIn contrast, the sulfate process uses sulfuric acid to extract TiO2 from ilmenite ore, producing a warmer undertone.

{"question":"How might the differences in injury reporting requirements across Kronos's global operations impact the company's ability to accurately assess and benchmark its safety performance?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[16],"raw_output":"","pred":"The differences in injury reporting requirements across Kronos's global operations can significantly impact the company's ability to accurately assess and benchmark its safety performance.  Each operating location is subject to local laws and regulations that dictate what injuries are required to be recorded and reported, which can vary widely from country to country.  This variability can lead to inconsistencies in injury reporting, making it difficult to compare safety performance across different locations.\n\nFor internal global tracking, benchmarking, and identifying opportunities for improvement, Kronos uses a U.S.-based injury rate calculation to arrive at a global total frequency rate.  However, this approach may not be directly comparable to the recordable incident rates calculated under U.S. law.  The differences in reporting requirements can result in underreporting or overreporting of injuries, depending on the location's regulations.  This can skew the global safety metrics, potentially masking real safety issues or overestimating safety improvements.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, Kronos must ensure clear communication and standardization of reporting practices across all locations.  This includes developing a global injury reporting framework that aligns with local regulations while maintaining consistency in data collection and analysis.  By doing so, Kronos can more accurately assess its safety performance and identify areas for improvement, regardless of the location.  This approach would also facilitate more meaningful comparisons and benchmarking of safety performance across the company's global operations.","source":"data/test/NYSE_KRO_2023.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[16,13,89,91,51,3,23,5,17,61,6,14,46,12,60,93,50,56,20,71,1,92,45,2,4,21,44,11,58,32,55,57,59,15,35,88,19,54,94,24,31,48,70,30,40,7,41,90,18,64,87,22,26,52,25,38,81,27,86,29,62,28,68,42,53,37,8,34,65,36,85,9,77,83,43,66,39,84,69,78,82,74,63,49,33,47,73,10,76,80,75,79,67,72],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The overall increase from 2019 to 2023 suggests a long-term commitment to growth and investment in the company's infrastructure and technology.\n\nThe fluctuation in capital expenditures may reflect Robert Half's response to market conditions and strategic decisions.  The company may have invested heavily in 2020 to capitalize on opportunities or prepare for future growth, while the lower expenditures in 2021 and 2022 could have been a response to economic uncertainty or a focus on operational efficiency.

Designer Brands Inc. experienced significant volatility and a decline in stock value, with its cumulative total return dropping from $100 in February 2019 to $38.23 in February 2024. This stark decline is likely due to internal company issues, such as financial difficulties, strategic missteps, or market-specific challenges. The company's stock price was particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted retail operations and consumer spending.\n\nIn contrast, the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the S&P MidCap 400 Retail Index showed more stable and positive growth.

The slight decrease in non-U.S. revenue share, while still substantial, suggests that DS's global expansion efforts are yielding positive results, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous year.","source":"data/test/NYSE_MCO_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[58,59,60,63,64,65,55,94,95,66,73,86,121,93,12,48,120,16,57,122,23,18,91,99,15,17,67,69,129,50,37,74,115,117,102,112,88,13,34,82,71,24,35,45,49,104,21,43,68,39,92,97,101,85,19,125,14,30,36,72,116,98,139,106,127,70,78,80,107,38,81,130,33,41,61,62,109,118,132,26,83,22,42,46,87,100,105,111,128,11,47,76,89,54,79,29,6,28,32,52,84,96,77,126,5,25,131,9,31,27,40,51,110,124,90,56,10,53,114,103,119,133,108,3,113,7,75,135,44,134,2,4,8,140,123,20,136,1,137,138],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

This divestiture resulted in a substantial reduction in the company's overall tax provision for the year. Additionally, the income tax expense for 2023 included tax benefits of $41 million related to foreign-derived intangible income and $30 million related to the release of tax reserves in the U.S. due to the settlement of the audit with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2018 and 2019. These tax benefits collectively contributed to the lower effective tax rate and reduced the overall tax provision for the year.

Separating and independently enforcing each clause and part thereof, even if they are contained in the same clause, sub-clause, paragraph, sub-paragraph, sentence or phrase.\n\n2.

The decrease in liabilities might also reflect a more conservative approach to borrowing, aligning with the company's overall financial strategy to maintain a healthy capital structure and enhance financial stability.","source":"data/test/NYSE_GPRK_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[204,205,186,107,180,196,206,218,183,24,176,210,108,170,23,27,116,198,106,127,45,207,222,184,171,174,147,173,12,41,103,119,163,192,35,113,115,181,185,55,154,165,11,21,31,168,169,188,189,224,20,152,211,231,61,79,118,178,209,220,246,22,104,117,120,160,230,36,39,135,137,145,175,179,191,197,225,18,51,121,208,105,153,161,40,88,95,109,26,111,214,66,199,249,167,172,60,64,151,223,114,125,193,38,70,134,80,158,213,46,62,219,67,177,200,212,227,32,71,17,57,142,187,93,126,228,232,29,63,162,164,166,195,42,77,241,34,56,73,112,226,25,30,54,194,242,33,37,69,102,130,143,190,215,229,50,53,248,59,97,250,49,76,91,131,182,90,129,221,16,81,122,146,217,44,78,240,253,10,68,3,13,19,43,48,157,251,15,75,58,110,4,14,86,233,247,150,236,243,89,92,99,149,239,252,28,96,98,201,203,257,259,133,244,74,132,65,87,128,83,216,100,139,141,235,256,138,85,5,72,84,124,156,144,148,245,255,101,1,2,8,136,237,52,155,254,47,258,140,123,234,238,202,82,159,260,9,6,94,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The agreement involves the transfer of biological materials and information to develop and commercialize phage products for treating bacterial infections. This aligns with the focus on medical technology transfer, as it involves the dissemination of scientific and technological advancements in the medical field.\n\nThe agreement also mentions the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA), which is a federal law that governs the transfer of technology from federal laboratories to private entities. This further supports the idea that the department or entity is involved in facilitating the commercialization of medical technologies developed through government-funded research.\n\nOverall, the logo and the content of the licensing agreement suggest that the department or entity is likely responsible for managing and facilitating the transfer of medical technologies, including phage products, from government laboratories to private companies like Adaptive Phage Therapeutics.","source":"data/test/NYSE_PHGE_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[175,174,177,178,187,186,163,180,198,172,166,189,7,225,231,34,244,182,223,238,164,168,181,247,35,170,33,80,157,185,188,190,230,63,131,207,219,154,212,215,158,167,191,199,214,237,239,242,246,156,159,173,217,224,240,250,60,64,169,171,213,265,4,136,151,153,184,192,232,233,245,266,276,65,152,161,208,218,229,243,252,260,272,56,69,71,77,160,165,216,226,282,54,92,132,183,195,203,205,210,236,279,62,109,134,155,197,200,211,249,267,112,204,209,251,255,268,281,14,32,43,106,139,179,194,222,248,269,1,3,58,61,78,82,120,128,149,221,227,16,87,130,133,146,193,196,206,220,228,241,253,259,277,280,59,97,105,121,202,262,263,274,23,48,66,76,145,150,201,234,264,270,31,70,148,254,257,261,273,38,53,278,17,104,135,235,271,72,94,119,147,2,5,15,28,30,37,42,51,79,256,47,68,74,25,39,88,122,258,275,40,118,126,27,55,91,111,127,29,36,45,50,81,89,108,162,83,84,110,24,129,22,44,57,73,86,99,107,20,41,95,113,117,49,67,96,115,6,52,116,143,46,90,138,8,13,75,85,100,21,125,142,98,9,93,114,18,137,26,124,141,10,101,12,123,11,102,140,144,176,19,103],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The GAAP revenue increased by 5%, while Billings increased by 3%. This discrepancy is due to a negative impact of 240 basis points from foreign currency exchange rates on Billings. Billings are recognized when invoiced, and since the company invoices customers in multiple currencies, fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly affect the reported Billings. In contrast, GAAP revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term, which is less susceptible to the immediate impact of foreign currency movements.

This increase could lead to a higher net loss or reduced net income, affecting the company's financial health and potentially its credit rating.

This indicates that the cost associated with providing benefits for the current year remained unchanged, contributing a small portion to the overall obligation.\n\n2. **Interest Cost**: The interest cost increased from $0.3 million in 2022 to $0.5 million in 2023. This rise reflects the higher discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation, which in turn increased the present value of future benefits, thus increasing the overall obligation.\n\n3. **Benefits Paid**: The benefits paid decreased from $0.2 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023. This decrease suggests that fewer benefits were distributed to employees, reducing the immediate impact on the obligation.\n\n4. **Actuarial Gain**: The actuarial gain decreased from $2.0 million in 2022 to $0.7 million in 2023. This reduction indicates that the positive impact of changes in the discount rate or other actuarial assumptions was less pronounced in 2023, contributing to a smaller decrease in the obligation.\n\n5. **Currency Fluctuation Adjustment**: The currency fluctuation adjustment decreased from $0.8 million in 2022 to $0.1 million in 2023. This reduction reflects the impact of currency movements on the obligation, with a smaller negative impact in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nOverall, the increase in interest cost and the decrease in benefits paid were the primary factors contributing to the change in the benefit obligation, while the actuarial gain and currency fluctuation adjustment had a smaller impact.","source":"data/test/NYSE_CMP_2023.json","annotator":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,118,84,85,113,115,7,71,79,83,130,97,68,73,72,116,19,74,102,120,49,88,90,94,125,138,17,78,34,46,69,80,121,62,47,129,45,50,81,100,48,87,105,112,9,101,106,126,131,135,114,95,104,117,136,142,43,44,61,96,134,12,57,110,70,75,20,21,67,140,122,107,123,127,137,56,77,103,37,145,55,111,33,92,108,109,128,155,6,160,76,133,24,63,82,162,25,99,23,35,86,132,4,66,18,93,32,91,1,98,153,41,22,64,151,14,124,141,30,31,26,144,36,157,54,143,15,166,16,60,163,38,139,149,42,27,152,10,28,150,29,65,89,3,5,53,51,13,11,158,159,8,59,39,154,165,146,147,164,161,2,40,52,156,148,58],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4 - Mostly Correct","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This advice is crucial for vehicle safety because it prevents the introduction of fire hazards into the vehicle. Fires can quickly spread, leading to severe injuries or fatalities. Furthermore, the presence of these items can obstruct the driver's view, making it difficult to navigate safely. The text also mentions that the front passenger's airbag may not function properly if these objects are placed on the instrument panel, increasing the risk of injury during an accident. Overall, the advice against bringing these items into the vehicle is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all occupants and prevent potential accidents.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[112,242,48,50,399,388,239,46,389,532,70,104,132,429,62,384,59,241,6,459,466,113,379,537,98,111,530,97,142,528,103,382,518,525,534,383,385,314,395,517,47,206,453,51,208,226,302,365,373,397,400,60,125,482,510,52,107,213,240,372,527,71,205,209,396,398,110,117,187,425,426,522,57,58,74,122,350,427,531,63,66,102,266,275,315,390,100,116,124,222,263,303,366,376,465,467,512,55,56,363,423,495,529,551,61,126,207,370,377,418,424,483,2,3,64,69,127,253,255,257,358,422,496,49,90,94,101,144,374,380,387,401,513,14,45,88,149,238,244,336,355,362,494,514,569,75,154,265,353,485,489,252,258,357,392,457,521,4,72,87,135,225,229,267,356,381,391,463,515,523,141,264,288,299,472,93,186,246,340,516,44,78,89,105,121,227,106,145,330,333,361,464,486,488,499,53,67,73,115,129,293,348,349,364,404,487,520,533,31,109,204,393,417,434,449,492,524,137,221,250,294,419,444,497,519,553,92,99,150,162,212,268,304,430,511,95,254,285,291,368,555,568,54,159,193,214,245,310,327,335,339,342,346,352,410,439,68,139,191,219,220,277,296,329,493,22,79,83,188,192,243,256,371,378,460,552,554,210,216,506,1,24,82,84,120,217,269,375,490,108,321,403,428,446,25,119,130,284,311,503,65,91,128,270,421,461,491,133,134,152,211,251,324,451,454,468,80,85,96,123,138,202,276,286,462,42,77,114,118,249,279,297,344,452,541,557,38,76,189,218,228,231,237,278,456,7,10,17,39,131,185,190,196,203,273,334,367,436,478,546,567,23,35,172,261,287,292,347,432,433,540,558,11,300,301,322,323,359,409,437,447,479,544,545,550,570,157,175,184,338,415,438,448,504,143,155,164,223,233,282,308,313,319,337,507,21,36,168,174,180,215,247,260,343,442,443,455,508,13,33,224,274,280,316,317,325,369,542,556,16,171,262,271,290,305,306,320,341,470,535,8,32,148,234,281,543,30,41,86,140,167,232,272,328,458,475,481,484,502,9,81,156,173,201,230,248,298,309,326,345,469,473,34,37,195,236,259,283,331,354,406,445,5,19,26,146,153,163,170,307,312,318,351,386,435,440,12,43,182,199,295,332,360,471,477,505,165,178,183,235,412,450,536,538,151,526,40,402,539,136,198,394,549,169,181,289,416,480,564,15,29,197,498,405,166,28,179,476,420,563,18,548,176,408,160,20,27,194,501,147,413,562,177,411,431,500,200,547,509,158,441,560,559,414,474,566,161,407,565,561],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What precautions should be taken when using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, and why are these precautions necessary?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[530],"raw_output":"","pred":"When using a high-pressure cleaner to wash a vehicle, several precautions should be taken to prevent damage to the vehicle's body and parts. First, keep the nozzle of the high-pressure cleaner away from the vehicle sufficiently. Bringing the nozzle too close or pointing it directly at the front grill, bumper, or other openings can cause damage to the vehicle's body and parts. This is because the high-pressure water can penetrate these openings, potentially causing water ingress and malfunction of the vehicle's electrical components or other parts.\n\nAdditionally, avoid pointing the nozzle at door glasses and door frames, as this can allow water to enter the cabin, leading to potential damage to the interior. It is crucial to maintain a safe distance and ensure proper nozzle placement to avoid these issues. By following these precautions, you can effectively clean the vehicle without risking damage to its components or functionality.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[530,336,529,340,532,144,350,388,246,483,132,265,527,142,330,429,533,267,303,465,528,111,365,381,418,531,239,122,126,459,534,376,425,208,314,390,371,206,379,382,384,387,521,204,537,48,121,225,252,353,378,91,253,380,479,494,103,258,263,403,424,453,212,254,255,302,423,452,466,515,226,275,374,377,426,518,525,389,63,221,256,266,349,357,373,520,58,116,385,404,457,472,496,523,102,110,115,510,71,250,486,93,113,296,482,513,514,524,52,101,104,229,14,145,150,240,392,416,488,72,90,125,241,245,273,274,454,470,497,519,57,59,66,112,209,238,391,401,464,44,187,372,396,55,56,159,174,213,361,398,493,45,61,62,70,244,268,354,397,428,522,558,46,47,50,51,60,75,88,98,117,207,217,285,375,417,568,65,69,87,205,222,291,299,554,97,149,196,243,276,352,355,410,458,489,105,129,242,315,348,366,400,427,541,3,22,74,124,133,134,137,192,358,491,49,257,284,288,356,409,422,492,495,511,551,569,33,54,227,269,362,446,455,512,37,139,321,436,463,485,516,94,143,310,319,324,399,434,499,53,277,308,395,118,154,163,188,293,393,432,451,109,114,437,438,462,2,305,333,447,448,461,481,89,218,228,550,108,190,191,316,327,339,342,369,433,526,556,106,152,304,4,83,162,247,261,344,419,430,517,553,67,107,210,219,249,364,175,211,260,367,484,120,135,230,335,368,442,443,444,23,25,92,202,487,11,38,78,439,220,223,449,540,542,84,127,153,64,141,146,320,322,323,347,363,456,338,77,177,232,272,544,557,1,10,95,248,292,351,415,471,473,477,555,79,99,193,287,406,552,68,236,264,311,7,96,279,507,73,307,412,476,155,170,214,270,309,318,138,370,5,200,233,294,467,36,136,140,158,186,383,411,478,6,30,216,278,508,271,329,504,100,237,440,128,130,160,259,282,312,405,408,27,31,345,505,313,326,468,475,545,17,35,148,185,337,343,469,325,346,546,32,119,172,203,251,262,297,317,543,298,21,157,231,328,359,460,147,180,498,502,224,235,281,474,24,161,194,234,300,306,450,490,215,445,151,164,166,535,13,41,81,131,8,123,331,171,280,301,76,86,286,181,435,334,414,9,82,156,184,283,332,413,16,183,189,386,407,561,12,42,506,29,567,80,169,195,431,18,34,201,295,536,549,182,197,26,40,85,167,178,290,570,15,28,503,20,564,566,198,199,39,165,341,173,480,421,509,548,289,360,538,500,19,176,402,168,420,563,394,441,501,565,43,560,559,179,562,547,539],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Impact from the side to the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment\n2. Impact from the side at an oblique angle\n\nThese scenarios are particularly dangerous for occupants because:\n\n1. Impact from the side to the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment: This could occur if the vehicle is hit by another vehicle or object on the side, but not directly in the passenger area. The airbags are designed to protect passengers in the passenger compartment, so they won't inflate in this scenario. This could leave passengers vulnerable to severe injuries from the impact.\n\n2. Impact from the side at an oblique angle: This type of collision can be particularly dangerous because it doesn't align with the airbag's intended protection area. The airbags are designed to inflate in a direct side impact, but an oblique angle could cause the vehicle to roll or twist, making it difficult for the airbags to deploy effectively. This could result in severe injuries to passengers.\n\nThese scenarios highlight the limitations of airbag protection and the importance of proper seatbelt use to ensure maximum safety during collisions.","source":"data/test/swift_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[109,110,103,95,94,104,108,107,112,100,99,106,555,97,105,14,98,101,44,46,48,59,357,372,62,74,111,393,552,383,429,71,87,47,60,132,189,288,294,384,205,389,398,41,82,263,339,439,61,102,269,297,6,49,242,347,23,52,66,93,315,373,404,7,50,79,280,361,382,532,88,96,348,416,463,42,376,388,92,227,277,303,342,409,241,363,400,522,528,282,310,333,335,444,51,68,296,425,434,470,524,537,550,90,273,356,358,366,472,55,69,77,281,304,408,414,417,423,38,57,406,407,449,553,33,78,89,113,187,275,286,300,311,329,351,379,403,426,521,554,43,67,70,117,264,265,267,338,396,412,424,433,496,45,73,75,240,279,359,378,432,465,510,9,31,36,130,321,385,551,22,35,39,63,64,116,122,125,137,194,230,344,362,374,413,489,520,12,72,76,186,188,193,213,237,276,278,293,330,340,438,453,523,533,16,83,219,233,236,270,314,322,392,395,466,556,124,142,154,204,208,216,229,268,271,390,419,442,443,525,32,58,65,244,284,291,353,401,405,437,527,37,84,129,299,327,332,346,15,34,127,133,162,201,226,239,248,266,345,365,377,380,479,569,13,27,120,121,143,179,192,198,206,207,231,285,334,336,349,422,503,530,91,134,169,184,209,224,225,253,257,328,343,464,467,469,529,568,2,24,114,115,135,136,138,152,168,182,190,197,256,302,375,391,447,471,516,40,56,123,150,203,217,220,228,252,287,301,399,411,459,484,485,487,18,29,131,175,178,180,200,214,246,292,312,448,490,515,518,30,54,128,176,211,255,258,324,428,468,498,26,166,171,195,249,262,341,355,364,381,415,458,546,570,4,21,126,174,181,202,212,274,290,323,337,440,454,475,488,513,545,164,170,191,196,325,418,435,460,461,493,494,495,28,141,144,185,238,289,306,326,371,450,476,483,519,25,146,147,172,234,235,250,316,331,350,352,387,421,486,492,497,512,517,558,81,153,163,173,218,222,254,283,313,319,320,491,501,86,167,210,221,223,232,309,317,410,436,462,478,482,531,53,139,199,295,308,430,445,474,481,536,8,80,159,165,386,427,446,567,10,17,85,118,183,251,397,540,559,560,145,148,151,215,259,305,360,367,420,457,534,544,565,3,272,354,451,514,140,261,368,369,119,177,394,499,557,563,500,160,307,542,511,564,298,539,260,370,477,538,245,505,549,5,247,526,456,502,543,243,318,402,158,452,548,11,455,535,149,155,1,541,473,506,156,480,19,157,161,508,561,504,562,507,20,566,509,547,441,431],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This method is efficient for removing individual or a small number of pictures that you no longer need.\n\nOn the other hand, \"ALL FRAMES\" enables the deletion of all unprotected pictures in the current folder.

The NEC calculates the load based on the total connected load listed on the model/serial/rating plate, which is less than the total connected load. This means the actual load on the circuit is less than what the rating plate indicates.\n\nFor a 15 kW range at 120/240 V, the NEC calculated load is less than 15 kW. Therefore, a 40 or 50 ampere power supply cord kit and circuit protection are specified.

Therefore, when towing a vehicle, it is crucial to ensure that the towed vehicle does not obstruct the radar sensor's beam to maintain the effectiveness of the PFCW system.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[396,393,391,394,398,397,287,291,285,526,316,253,355,385,288,540,114,282,286,290,127,113,542,110,106,132,246,126,244,25,342,387,136,382,392,450,263,386,449,514,518,26,98,384,142,182,383,62,388,472,124,158,276,338,399,8,223,231,199,440,121,159,369,373,389,390,1,164,204,219,324,343,371,395,409,521,131,232,541,221,537,9,33,162,520,170,209,255,279,289,325,410,512,22,166,433,438,519,140,328,85,160,307,522,122,148,165,233,309,322,339,448,516,222,273,406,517,524,529,536,19,134,147,152,154,270,301,313,347,486,497,501,43,53,108,172,183,220,238,427,3,107,217,264,402,463,125,258,312,318,330,340,437,447,465,527,84,138,256,262,461,525,535,7,10,135,169,180,195,205,260,296,317,348,370,457,462,499,64,66,102,141,203,269,272,280,310,327,479,491,156,171,274,349,418,477,511,20,133,226,297,441,55,61,93,104,225,306,331,345,361,368,416,422,439,481,14,23,86,144,240,251,319,320,363,467,484,493,101,145,200,265,271,494,531,50,52,116,130,163,197,234,329,337,445,468,47,99,128,146,208,227,261,275,356,379,480,523,5,32,40,46,57,224,229,257,278,300,323,341,357,364,411,417,434,458,488,42,83,109,151,161,216,218,237,266,267,354,421,430,435,446,56,67,115,167,239,247,292,344,378,478,533,15,178,198,210,252,293,360,372,380,76,173,194,215,228,230,235,245,321,336,362,420,436,515,48,65,87,92,155,201,248,268,470,473,474,502,505,100,143,196,259,277,298,315,403,431,485,513,18,34,38,39,41,75,97,150,157,184,206,243,333,469,27,69,119,207,304,311,332,358,70,79,112,177,202,334,377,404,408,412,498,528,44,78,236,544,37,58,60,63,88,129,353,374,381,423,426,456,2,51,68,82,111,187,414,508,21,80,168,179,294,425,453,466,496,500,504,506,510,24,45,49,94,103,283,299,308,181,451,482,6,123,139,242,303,314,507,77,95,153,176,191,295,400,407,475,12,35,188,212,335,424,489,503,509,11,31,74,105,211,281,366,492,17,54,149,175,213,359,454,476,28,36,71,305,326,464,471,539,81,254,375,429,490,29,185,186,189,543,214,405,415,442,30,59,91,190,376,13,241,302,419,530,89,137,193,284,413,487,118,352,365,444,538,4,428,90,350,483,401,455,120,72,367,249,346,192,432,459,532,351,96,443,452,534,117,16,73,250,174,460,495],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This sensor is a crucial component of the Rear Automatic Emergency Braking (Rear AEB) system. Its primary function is to detect obstacles directly behind the vehicle when the vehicle is in reverse. The rear parking sensor works by emitting ultrasonic waves that bounce off any objects in its path. These echoes are then analyzed by the vehicle's control system to determine the distance and location of any obstacles.\n\nWhen the vehicle is backing up and the rear parking sensor detects an obstacle, it sends a signal to the Rear AEB system. This system then assesses the risk of a collision and, if necessary, automatically applies the brakes to help prevent the vehicle from hitting the obstacle. The rear parking sensor is essential for the Rear AEB system to function correctly, ensuring that the vehicle can safely navigate its surroundings and avoid potential collisions.","source":"data/test/23_Outlander_English.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[403,404,402,292,406,109,285,405,8,540,15,253,290,526,102,110,114,283,113,319,320,307,309,247,348,303,223,243,6,121,152,302,321,143,218,245,291,38,132,153,324,392,274,325,503,86,94,180,344,428,474,82,216,228,296,13,118,127,230,239,310,328,343,355,383,421,423,441,66,157,238,329,331,401,463,482,542,30,96,297,373,7,10,69,148,217,384,394,427,11,312,318,399,436,93,111,194,19,155,162,351,479,9,14,47,58,84,106,112,142,206,277,357,468,12,147,154,418,510,535,29,100,134,145,207,229,295,354,382,95,470,481,500,146,236,359,512,27,105,183,220,255,323,334,379,398,475,478,136,166,233,350,358,389,97,128,140,179,208,259,280,332,20,50,103,67,79,137,210,237,445,78,104,176,235,279,306,397,21,25,99,209,241,390,426,37,49,62,150,205,278,286,308,375,43,224,370,380,491,51,264,330,141,221,287,322,339,342,391,366,76,122,123,133,144,163,184,197,199,311,396,36,87,124,164,381,388,467,486,23,34,40,75,169,219,284,425,439,22,41,61,171,298,409,473,55,126,131,160,232,347,465,225,313,346,362,477,537,541,17,46,139,269,335,442,447,457,484,511,18,56,85,193,275,349,364,413,498,523,52,57,81,83,92,165,200,201,372,376,410,430,509,519,70,88,190,215,258,314,317,337,48,77,135,341,60,156,159,211,248,387,98,107,212,240,368,393,26,65,125,172,231,356,440,24,39,91,158,187,504,516,203,265,434,455,129,182,195,301,336,361,524,63,161,177,227,300,385,407,483,28,64,73,252,289,369,493,538,45,71,151,480,33,80,178,222,271,429,459,35,202,345,363,438,44,53,54,130,244,246,371,374,536,5,167,170,191,352,360,450,446,488,31,213,333,340,499,501,505,544,59,115,138,234,251,270,288,327,471,525,74,226,272,198,204,254,276,400,414,451,466,530,68,116,168,415,419,420,462,533,256,326,437,119,175,316,338,422,173,267,315,365,367,411,461,507,539,249,378,449,520,42,72,192,262,293,408,117,454,464,472,490,185,395,458,515,2,412,424,444,476,101,453,529,4,32,149,469,497,518,527,266,417,485,487,502,181,299,386,435,531,496,532,242,263,294,189,416,489,3,90,214,273,120,260,431,456,522,281,495,508,268,433,514,543,108,188,282,432,494,305,377,448,492,528,186,196,261,517,257,443,513,521,89,353,506,304,250,16,452,1,174,460,534],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

It helps prevent hydrogen gas from escaping and accumulating near the battery, which could potentially ignite and cause an explosion.\n\n2. The moist cloth absorbs any battery fluid that might splash out during the jump starting process, reducing the risk of acid burns or other corrosive injuries.\n\n3. It provides a barrier between the battery and any sparks or flames that could ignite the hydrogen gas.\n\n4. It helps cool the battery, which can be hot during jump starting and may reduce the risk of a fire.\n\n5.

This gesture allows you to navigate between the most recently used applications without having to open the Recents window.\n\nTo view all recently opened apps, you would swipe up from the bottom of the screen and pause. This action opens the Recents window, which displays a list of all recently used apps. The Recents window provides a more comprehensive overview of all open applications, allowing you to quickly switch between multiple apps that were recently active.\n\nThe key difference between these two gestures is that the first one is a quick swipe gesture that allows for rapid navigation between two apps, while the second one is a pause gesture that opens a more detailed view of all recently opened apps. The swipe gesture is more efficient for switching between a small number of apps, whereas the pause gesture is better suited for accessing a full list of recently used applications.","source":"data/test/miui_14.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[10,11,31,14,8,15,7,78,32,84,22,83,100,20,21,9,109,18,72,90,111,2,76,105,86,116,37,19,81,93,117,3,33,95,106,16,61,73,104,25,85,103,94,107,17,30,69,75,102,113,108,71,92,48,52,70,77,101,41,49,47,63,12,13,27,39,50,58,66,80,82,87,91,4,60,115,45,59,64,68,88,118,53,62,79,29,55,28,46,114,57,67,89,96,99,42,51,120,24,56,74,97,6,43,54,40,65,112,44,110,34,119,26,23,36,38,35,98,5,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}
{"question":"What are the potential drawbacks of enabling the \"Install unknown apps\" permission and the \"Alarms & reminders\" permission on your tablet?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[103],"raw_output":"","pred":"Enabling the \"Install unknown apps\" permission on your tablet can make your device more vulnerable to attack by unknown apps. This is because allowing apps from unknown sources increases the risk of downloading malware or other malicious software. These apps can potentially steal personal data, access sensitive information, or even control your device remotely. Additionally, the \"Install unknown apps\" permission can lead to a less secure environment, as the tablet may not have the necessary security measures to protect against these unknown apps.\n\nEnabling the \"Alarms & reminders\" permission can also have potential drawbacks. While it allows apps to set alarms and schedule time-sensitive actions, it can lead to increased battery usage. Apps running in the background to monitor alarms and reminders can consume more power, potentially shortening the battery life of your tablet. Furthermore, if not managed properly, this permission can lead to a cluttered and intrusive notification system, which can be distracting and negatively impact the user experience. It's important to carefully consider which apps require these permissions and to monitor their usage to ensure they do not negatively affect the device's performance or security.","source":"data/test/miui_14.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[18,103,102,105,114,94,25,72,100,106,91,88,115,89,90,80,104,28,59,78,92,108,17,12,11,15,26,86,110,4,37,71,16,21,43,93,113,7,42,107,118,120,32,41,99,10,22,29,40,79,117,35,36,75,33,38,50,74,101,109,2,8,19,20,87,119,23,56,6,31,44,47,58,70,76,95,39,85,97,81,27,48,111,3,49,73,116,14,24,30,45,65,98,55,57,60,82,112,34,67,9,69,96,13,53,62,66,68,61,64,77,84,63,52,5,83,46,51,54,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

These features, such as Call Waiting, Call Waiting/Caller ID, Caller ID, Voice Mail, and answering machines, can interfere with the fax machine's ability to properly receive or send faxes. The interference occurs when these features signal or interrupt the fax transmission process.\n\nBrother's ECM (Error Correction Mode) feature helps mitigate these issues by detecting and correcting errors that may occur during fax transmission. This feature is particularly useful in environments where multiple devices share the same phone line and have custom features. By employing ECM, the fax machine can maintain a stable connection and ensure that fax transmissions are not disrupted by the presence of other phone features. This allows for smoother fax operations and reduces the likelihood of transmission errors or interruptions.","source":"data/test/mfcj1800dw.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[381,379,380,384,211,210,221,388,218,169,166,382,180,215,224,197,258,196,329,99,345,4,186,3,213,330,217,5,101,349,390,392,439,188,339,377,467,165,174,233,248,385,468,168,374,375,457,163,167,191,195,216,243,247,155,170,244,328,376,193,198,225,297,411,178,181,378,391,393,20,94,347,92,150,219,245,343,346,463,482,18,162,171,172,179,246,314,344,400,177,212,214,372,373,423,458,461,470,472,2,47,184,185,192,222,253,322,353,428,438,456,462,80,183,223,351,445,479,6,17,95,175,176,327,340,355,363,386,394,134,137,234,287,315,421,465,82,83,97,232,280,466,59,63,208,226,227,267,451,481,15,105,141,242,250,318,406,408,429,460,78,151,187,194,220,239,265,272,331,415,450,10,16,125,157,209,251,252,270,301,364,409,412,444,459,13,104,118,135,158,173,189,202,249,399,434,25,145,156,205,236,260,275,278,319,348,350,365,405,427,435,68,149,182,241,263,395,417,418,420,464,48,75,89,115,117,129,136,164,199,235,238,266,281,284,285,309,324,325,354,401,410,1,32,46,111,201,231,240,279,317,326,342,352,356,368,402,416,431,446,452,76,103,112,128,160,190,255,261,264,271,277,305,321,332,383,413,419,432,437,483,12,43,44,49,85,109,113,123,132,237,299,307,316,407,426,433,447,453,473,29,36,40,50,52,61,62,70,131,147,159,203,268,311,313,370,398,403,436,30,81,88,102,140,143,146,282,358,369,371,389,469,54,58,90,106,228,310,334,367,26,33,114,120,161,200,291,14,37,56,139,204,207,276,283,289,320,387,440,478,19,34,154,259,449,475,477,485,38,66,73,77,86,107,153,206,295,323,333,414,425,442,8,87,152,303,306,396,60,65,286,142,293,296,341,359,362,28,71,257,269,288,448,487,22,57,91,302,360,361,366,64,79,93,486,9,11,74,121,397,404,443,454,476,45,84,298,312,338,35,51,148,337,424,455,480,55,67,69,119,130,304,335,430,98,122,357,254,274,471,42,53,96,108,138,41,24,144,21,100,273,308,72,336,422,116,292,294,39,256,474,23,27,230,484,31,127,229,300,441,126,110,124,133,290,262,7],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"How might the \"Display by image rating\" jump method be useful for efficiently reviewing a large collection of photos, and what potential limitation does it have?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[622],"raw_output":"","pred":"The \"Display by image rating\" jump method is particularly useful for efficiently reviewing a large collection of photos by allowing users to quickly navigate through images based on their ratings. This method enables users to focus on photos they have rated highly, which can be particularly helpful when searching for specific types of images or when trying to identify the best shots from a large batch. By selecting a rating, users can jump through images that share that rating, making it easier to find images that meet certain criteria or to quickly review a subset of their photos.\n\nFor example, if a user wants to review only the photos they have rated as \"good\" or \"excellent,\" they can set the jump method to \"Display by image rating\" and select the appropriate rating. This allows them to skip through lower-rated images and focus on the more valuable content.\n\nHowever, a potential limitation of this method is that it may not be suitable for users who want to review all images, regardless of their ratings. If a user needs to see every photo in a collection, they would need to disable the rating-based jump method or manually navigate through all images. Additionally, if the user has not rated many images, the jump method might not be as effective, as there may not be a significant difference in ratings to jump between.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[622,566,518,617,563,311,511,561,680,87,521,4,180,309,184,618,6,565,187,303,562,615,679,623,301,522,532,533,312,519,621,836,516,627,692,859,875,319,689,910,529,572,607,614,514,564,575,580,619,842,631,634,812,512,546,557,513,624,628,9,411,527,543,569,630,651,19,318,525,531,574,578,714,877,191,196,310,333,608,743,7,197,335,523,666,668,694,721,786,834,843,119,395,534,596,633,636,195,216,255,308,331,548,573,576,893,218,332,412,413,554,571,696,699,813,852,854,120,283,286,337,343,552,678,5,73,315,317,601,603,629,313,324,459,550,556,559,592,595,626,83,277,320,322,398,590,591,660,794,856,885,125,127,258,328,330,558,612,664,894,110,179,185,267,334,541,567,798,853,121,189,393,517,535,549,570,616,640,658,691,693,787,857,194,326,341,387,493,537,577,582,598,600,609,665,695,701,708,791,835,881,122,124,186,316,376,381,502,515,520,545,579,594,613,672,739,814,892,85,91,108,138,153,214,291,544,606,663,681,707,810,846,860,141,159,181,321,348,402,602,653,656,670,677,57,90,94,104,284,306,327,344,366,391,415,524,581,593,605,611,625,675,753,776,792,849,855,3,10,84,112,161,254,279,323,336,356,463,468,586,646,654,858,886,102,202,266,268,325,357,365,446,471,597,635,878,49,117,167,193,217,228,539,547,568,587,589,620,722,731,736,775,821,872,29,39,109,123,205,269,280,282,290,295,377,401,530,536,588,599,642,682,706,741,763,848,868,876,898,50,81,136,139,152,190,232,235,262,281,299,367,373,382,414,498,509,555,632,674,715,718,729,760,767,815,911,132,219,221,227,239,253,273,274,338,350,384,460,479,481,508,697,724,758,880,101,154,157,188,203,211,374,380,496,499,553,662,700,732,747,768,782,796,799,869,897,913,25,28,51,107,118,199,230,233,292,345,354,406,417,424,430,501,669,710,757,777,789,790,797,803,832,888,95,96,158,163,213,342,432,480,526,551,583,604,837,99,113,114,140,171,215,287,364,408,435,440,483,703,709,733,745,820,34,60,69,111,151,160,183,209,298,304,359,362,389,416,486,610,702,711,847,92,129,240,329,452,466,641,698,805,807,8,31,38,88,137,192,260,353,487,510,79,93,106,207,307,349,372,497,500,819,212,236,278,407,410,478,542,650,661,688,806,56,76,100,142,206,224,305,355,392,433,495,652,655,673,705,723,870,52,294,404,436,447,457,560,667,738,764,808,26,71,98,115,241,243,250,259,340,361,378,540,730,795,850,895,900,15,53,270,285,300,371,420,637,683,717,725,742,778,785,866,889,891,902,916,21,116,174,198,244,314,375,394,584,671,783,802,896,86,156,275,276,360,368,421,423,441,454,491,494,766,771,801,18,442,451,467,538,645,647,690,713,770,788,804,887,901,134,289,456,488,657,751,809,914,155,234,237,242,379,450,506,712,727,840,46,170,172,261,386,426,428,482,687,719,752,818,89,103,182,246,352,358,383,390,399,405,429,473,503,648,735,746,769,800,851,917,82,126,164,168,288,296,302,419,528,874,909,54,80,223,248,264,293,438,458,477,772,774,816,862,864,97,131,148,165,249,257,388,409,431,470,676,761,823,833,883,130,147,200,263,272,297,418,485,585,720,737,826,867,251,339,475,490,639,740,762,773,1,12,45,128,173,208,225,448,793,863,879,222,229,396,474,861,58,162,403,465,489,492,643,704,765,61,105,178,256,385,434,443,507,659,744,784,871,72,422,686,726,750,873,33,62,135,204,210,346,455,464,716,781,908,48,175,427,734,829,838,47,150,245,252,363,425,453,22,169,220,445,469,476,649,685,748,845,865,40,43,484,505,728,844,16,226,265,271,754,780,830,899,68,145,238,27,44,397,461,906,20,149,247,449,472,817,177,779,919,462,756,839,907,23,70,77,439,822,35,176,828,11,32,37,74,78,644,684,755,827,17,24,133,146,444,825,905,42,66,890,918,369,30,201,882,904,166,351,75,370,400,437,2,504,759,63,67,144,231,347,841,41,64,915,749,13,36,638,811,59,65,824,831,14,912,884,903,55,143],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Additionally, the tips recommend using a tripod for stability when shooting night scenes, which would be beneficial if the river is illuminated at night.\n","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[110,111,100,109,285,498,353,112,219,888,132,277,101,131,193,205,501,739,129,786,81,89,230,323,758,121,345,349,203,587,596,694,416,541,57,499,894,103,127,542,588,892,291,107,115,562,608,885,126,236,257,509,519,104,255,579,666,891,597,610,510,518,607,632,114,119,120,142,374,537,105,227,287,383,384,535,586,624,402,536,590,613,692,701,401,551,602,611,34,299,337,348,386,534,578,609,612,693,123,139,290,373,532,665,872,889,31,113,128,152,307,573,94,97,117,124,552,672,887,71,93,118,99,108,215,239,366,433,508,543,580,663,670,836,96,305,595,664,18,424,458,598,913,83,91,92,134,367,153,186,228,315,417,437,674,130,461,619,76,174,321,451,547,98,122,158,252,336,630,213,224,262,308,346,372,392,909,106,154,181,194,196,288,432,468,599,35,296,350,355,415,486,560,886,19,84,146,231,387,395,446,521,668,787,904,908,238,243,406,453,3,27,32,176,188,211,223,316,320,407,434,438,680,895,137,140,218,264,298,334,359,726,789,871,162,179,195,275,306,376,445,470,538,795,72,87,151,180,248,343,354,388,601,136,185,235,269,286,339,418,439,503,539,559,604,869,906,116,144,157,313,457,487,533,90,170,232,242,283,311,342,460,469,524,95,133,217,225,340,450,500,502,681,737,832,898,905,8,135,192,202,246,261,272,274,289,419,443,522,528,634,863,875,30,52,164,178,184,199,214,341,454,623,868,187,206,254,265,333,379,575,760,796,849,870,75,150,197,253,258,260,280,281,309,332,467,697,699,833,877,4,50,125,168,284,435,459,585,714,791,794,827,838,842,867,20,28,148,161,183,212,241,244,293,322,324,338,422,471,523,568,662,776,165,182,204,240,247,360,380,391,440,481,483,485,778,878,38,62,245,278,331,381,473,496,540,622,633,695,715,754,826,149,169,229,233,279,335,427,455,464,529,618,628,688,755,777,835,874,5,17,156,200,250,251,294,476,505,574,584,615,679,719,825,828,829,910,65,74,189,198,221,267,268,273,282,319,344,429,449,526,700,738,837,899,177,216,295,318,420,425,472,474,488,507,545,557,605,621,648,751,775,830,897,2,6,37,42,102,147,297,317,325,475,527,531,689,907,60,61,270,301,347,352,382,393,423,430,431,462,463,491,567,626,750,766,816,25,143,190,249,314,357,364,398,426,428,436,466,495,511,606,696,782,840,10,26,58,69,85,207,226,263,312,358,390,452,497,530,603,722,790,820,864,1,40,47,222,259,365,389,411,477,480,492,493,563,660,675,736,843,903,16,54,77,82,159,276,400,441,442,444,447,490,504,614,616,709,797,857,896,901,73,292,300,329,412,544,581,650,659,732,767,802,818,821,844,856,859,866,63,86,163,385,558,617,690,698,711,860,862,45,46,53,59,78,175,201,210,234,378,394,396,465,546,548,553,561,571,653,661,793,839,167,208,361,405,408,478,520,525,554,564,569,572,582,636,651,685,702,798,824,855,861,881,893,911,21,64,141,160,166,303,369,479,494,550,834,44,80,266,351,482,489,512,592,641,678,703,761,900,902,22,68,145,172,514,549,640,684,808,66,171,362,594,629,669,687,712,763,858,23,88,368,371,576,686,691,764,788,810,819,138,302,330,421,570,643,677,779,780,781,792,809,854,43,155,220,404,413,566,577,716,717,721,683,708,735,743,748,772,785,812,375,448,516,555,647,823,29,173,565,725,822,879,48,271,326,456,556,768,771,815,916,24,36,67,328,397,409,515,631,706,730,817,880,237,399,620,658,851,914,49,310,484,517,583,718,801,873,883,7,15,327,649,720,884,33,39,506,671,765,806,191,209,656,644,654,733,783,14,256,377,403,414,600,682,740,51,635,710,747,769,9,356,410,645,79,304,363,625,627,673,593,655,713,745,749,865,13,642,707,724,742,753,876,646,728,11,591,667,513,589,705,723,704,731,773,841,55,370,752,813,657,762,744,800,805,807,56,70,756,846,853,12,639,652,729,741,774,770,784,676,637,757,811,919,41,734,746,850,804,727,799,890,814,912,803,848,852,638,845,759,918,882,915,831,917,847],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Under what circumstance might the effectiveness of Peripheral Illumination Correction be diminished, and what visual artifact might become more apparent as a result?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[260],"raw_output":"","pred":"The effectiveness of Peripheral Illumination Correction might be diminished under high ISO shooting conditions.  The note explicitly states that \"Depending on shooting conditions, noise may appear on the image periphery.  The higher the ISO speed, the lower the amount of correction will be.\"  This suggests that at higher ISO settings, the correction algorithm may struggle to effectively reduce the vignetting, potentially leaving the corners of the image darker than desired.  As a result, noise may become more noticeable in the periphery of the image, particularly noticeable in RAW, RAW+JPEG, or RAW+HEIF images.  This noise could manifest as grainy or speckled areas, especially noticeable in darker regions of the image.\n","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[260,584,259,195,409,299,336,264,585,231,269,127,206,219,261,437,392,417,452,121,218,26,118,53,278,337,263,334,120,265,354,108,152,199,367,119,224,262,387,335,604,318,869,109,214,221,266,313,316,449,458,460,605,112,459,474,76,116,162,253,373,414,699,876,95,126,213,257,286,371,606,754,879,86,96,122,258,267,273,408,447,471,607,799,871,894,28,51,350,365,500,611,681,85,179,237,268,270,298,380,451,456,493,619,695,755,866,888,90,200,249,340,415,740,229,232,291,511,545,583,810,878,4,113,170,175,490,502,776,5,25,223,239,87,157,158,431,540,610,801,863,165,183,461,569,629,893,114,296,372,688,701,6,132,700,368,412,919,716,201,275,280,407,434,864,872,58,212,243,301,308,358,381,144,154,194,488,508,513,523,576,774,865,125,147,581,890,235,359,399,475,491,844,68,69,236,406,463,571,592,613,737,10,29,72,117,238,433,438,516,601,636,753,791,45,106,159,166,248,589,784,797,825,868,107,168,174,338,413,445,470,577,780,81,103,307,479,486,637,7,19,404,496,497,618,886,889,124,140,211,375,391,532,639,874,24,135,137,226,357,398,867,891,2,34,50,100,374,444,524,586,628,687,877,882,57,66,123,177,205,483,543,546,597,620,768,837,12,23,79,80,134,225,242,256,287,403,478,495,777,245,254,364,469,537,600,711,722,289,675,679,800,826,905,54,164,361,370,416,446,454,587,875,82,172,519,579,627,842,110,167,353,506,560,588,805,8,89,215,230,252,395,405,480,489,522,626,678,750,873,94,160,240,281,477,482,512,514,794,803,833,142,290,315,397,487,650,662,744,798,843,862,887,910,18,47,115,149,356,443,654,748,811,840,881,883,255,272,448,515,558,602,603,743,757,775,831,852,44,145,246,435,507,596,616,630,674,751,128,182,202,528,652,756,762,793,796,812,821,823,27,186,227,288,317,326,331,333,772,362,442,544,593,696,726,105,139,228,274,329,418,453,686,760,816,839,870,3,11,203,271,455,468,481,549,556,591,666,735,752,802,832,39,92,102,150,241,310,323,339,378,424,529,550,20,56,61,153,181,185,450,457,517,530,590,617,702,60,151,430,792,820,855,93,156,197,421,527,691,817,141,222,282,344,396,426,440,441,472,476,734,758,789,901,904,75,83,129,247,320,328,330,432,621,719,804,822,824,277,295,420,427,531,672,761,763,783,836,858,896,32,91,184,193,297,302,494,566,659,728,787,795,818,31,422,428,429,467,473,660,747,781,790,33,65,84,143,173,250,341,466,609,614,633,918,67,74,101,342,423,526,598,653,658,713,742,835,16,187,198,216,324,325,376,536,623,685,697,715,718,730,813,892,903,73,171,304,322,327,360,366,383,425,572,624,643,819,828,861,906,35,52,180,309,321,343,369,384,402,503,547,622,651,656,693,733,749,815,880,900,916,13,191,220,436,485,553,669,732,746,909,41,70,155,161,345,388,525,612,644,649,36,98,104,136,188,276,311,632,759,769,834,902,30,38,319,382,439,505,557,567,647,724,727,788,856,885,913,914,279,635,838,49,133,146,210,283,292,501,521,539,631,642,663,689,770,841,845,42,169,233,411,484,492,667,741,767,771,1,14,55,77,217,464,520,534,552,565,608,646,655,773,782,189,284,348,582,677,729,739,807,830,9,88,148,176,196,303,306,332,386,504,555,574,625,648,725,745,764,895,111,130,312,419,533,575,657,690,710,738,778,859,912,15,379,615,676,684,694,714,765,786,857,899,48,300,349,673,731,897,908,131,535,580,640,698,706,717,898,71,138,163,190,244,251,462,559,570,705,709,785,809,827,853,17,22,62,78,99,465,548,704,43,207,285,305,355,385,394,554,568,671,723,806,347,363,390,561,208,293,352,518,562,563,594,638,720,829,917,21,294,551,564,573,664,665,683,692,37,40,510,680,814,851,854,911,46,97,849,64,234,346,377,645,808,63,393,410,707,59,389,538,578,736,766,703,192,541,670,682,599,661,721,779,846,314,499,542,634,668,847,509,884,209,351,400,401,850,595,860,204,708,848,498,178,907,641,712,915],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"What are the differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds between the mechanical shutter and the electronic 1st curtain shutter in still photo shooting, and how do these settings impact the use of flash?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[908],"raw_output":"","pred":"In still photo shooting, the mechanical shutter offers a wider range of shutter speeds compared to the electronic 1st curtain shutter. The mechanical shutter allows for settings from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, including bulb mode, with a set increment of 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop. The X-sync speed for the mechanical shutter is 1/200 seconds. \n\nIn contrast, the electronic 1st curtain shutter has a narrower range of shutter speeds, from 1/4000 to 30 seconds, also including bulb mode, with the same set increment of 1/3 stop or 1/2 stop. The X-sync speed for the electronic 1st curtain shutter is 1/250 seconds.\n\nThese differences in shutter speed settings and X-sync speeds impact the use of flash. The mechanical shutter allows for a wider range of shutter speeds, which can be beneficial for various lighting conditions and creative effects. However, the electronic 1st curtain shutter, with its faster X-sync speed, is more suitable for high-speed flash photography, as it can synchronize with the flash at a faster shutter speed, reducing the risk of motion blur and allowing for sharper images in low-light conditions. This makes the electronic 1st curtain shutter more versatile for flash photography compared to the mechanical shutter.","source":"data/test/eos_r10.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[908,161,162,910,174,177,298,299,170,869,164,384,163,344,870,179,500,868,165,499,150,286,218,181,291,894,899,293,3,294,296,887,4,224,905,906,184,223,297,874,195,339,147,826,116,152,204,132,172,336,417,825,840,131,144,312,681,135,502,113,157,387,688,830,833,838,867,892,133,145,173,180,313,388,75,156,212,167,215,308,185,301,348,350,904,137,140,338,349,72,74,176,96,159,199,219,269,432,791,824,837,885,206,821,898,149,380,849,122,130,143,155,295,352,818,909,5,115,136,300,335,102,211,503,843,57,175,198,221,316,345,871,913,50,168,205,333,828,886,889,891,114,134,169,253,138,171,376,872,151,318,395,83,202,213,226,282,337,434,829,77,119,139,158,207,216,407,35,285,394,726,127,178,355,382,460,835,153,186,209,343,393,405,633,112,182,214,274,341,367,392,739,183,200,266,76,81,94,277,278,281,836,91,324,386,419,492,795,832,20,193,275,381,383,841,290,303,442,596,630,2,89,187,210,486,615,789,839,34,80,95,188,228,241,248,262,307,311,317,323,374,437,469,866,106,121,203,267,268,276,391,471,787,806,33,90,107,120,148,160,217,321,418,732,817,897,31,87,92,98,192,231,279,280,707,93,97,100,283,284,496,700,822,108,146,190,334,340,875,32,104,189,232,314,385,433,446,458,501,808,110,287,406,429,454,476,508,888,99,124,166,257,330,342,411,450,459,485,541,579,7,85,239,420,489,28,264,320,487,616,8,73,105,117,118,390,641,763,842,884,18,225,265,315,463,488,807,834,878,61,70,84,103,288,322,474,493,504,674,809,6,17,123,194,201,230,252,309,326,328,438,447,509,511,661,788,907,67,208,449,738,810,863,880,25,78,451,786,815,877,254,365,366,416,436,445,587,624,666,895,26,42,111,443,475,675,733,758,760,38,109,222,234,235,260,423,428,430,461,512,519,537,557,590,725,794,54,101,196,242,261,271,289,319,331,864,914,86,129,351,507,577,585,653,659,59,125,233,247,258,378,422,431,481,667,697,711,762,812,823,126,236,246,306,346,353,531,544,197,396,468,483,540,621,628,844,858,82,237,368,371,441,505,873,240,372,373,421,425,426,455,497,792,27,154,229,347,424,453,631,636,642,677,698,71,88,227,238,245,305,327,332,427,477,597,614,663,737,896,244,250,357,413,495,612,651,715,816,820,854,325,401,440,467,498,543,607,632,695,736,800,802,354,400,457,464,568,618,669,671,673,742,778,790,797,9,142,369,479,480,526,528,529,539,583,634,660,679,734,798,805,911,60,220,259,439,466,708,743,65,255,270,272,273,359,482,538,640,683,689,705,717,718,727,783,304,399,402,462,470,490,513,514,516,527,534,542,582,603,617,620,622,645,676,703,710,714,752,776,22,364,409,452,465,472,494,520,545,561,576,588,602,662,709,735,744,745,793,819,52,403,525,535,604,649,650,657,685,690,721,755,761,861,912,79,243,398,518,532,567,601,639,652,654,682,731,30,128,478,484,510,572,600,629,648,655,680,722,764,777,21,51,63,435,448,536,562,635,701,704,712,741,766,801,902,916,251,444,560,605,637,706,730,782,785,827,883,16,191,414,558,569,608,647,658,672,699,740,813,881,45,46,62,404,523,625,696,724,831,862,893,903,19,24,360,379,491,552,686,694,719,723,751,767,846,853,855,900,10,44,64,370,410,456,584,586,609,665,670,720,746,753,799,901,36,292,329,412,524,613,729,771,40,69,408,415,473,549,578,589,716,775,780,796,851,310,517,565,573,598,623,643,656,687,693,702,748,749,754,768,804,23,43,47,49,515,547,556,559,591,362,522,530,551,553,570,574,575,592,610,668,249,377,521,580,581,664,678,747,857,859,141,550,611,644,692,781,845,11,15,58,68,619,765,784,865,1,56,571,546,564,594,595,713,848,256,506,533,554,599,684,750,779,860,66,356,626,774,847,850,555,691,856,263,375,563,890,29,358,361,728,772,548,593,606,757,759,876,53,566,769,770,773,882,389,646,37,39,811,879,915,919,852,302,756,41,14,917,397,814,627,48,13,363,803,12,55,638,918],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The \"Short Edge (Top)\" binding option ensures that the pages are in the correct order when folded, creating a neat, booklet-like output from the single-sided document.\n","source":"data/test/mfcj1010dw.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[89,70,82,81,73,77,515,69,136,137,503,3,64,74,83,66,68,84,86,362,143,173,71,410,133,138,363,126,141,139,88,91,129,2,132,48,92,506,174,411,456,119,51,49,76,419,50,152,492,15,478,65,134,165,408,166,135,476,487,211,467,486,507,87,93,120,142,178,234,457,140,153,208,483,517,39,90,209,407,412,128,207,491,94,130,210,495,37,148,160,497,513,514,520,529,455,474,498,527,530,43,103,118,161,249,54,55,104,123,131,149,199,276,279,417,528,5,101,271,482,502,30,107,154,172,206,240,406,17,24,57,121,155,162,197,201,413,454,274,292,349,477,512,27,56,171,175,180,215,261,336,466,52,106,168,184,202,204,221,62,117,127,146,167,182,510,203,219,275,440,449,484,505,40,45,105,108,147,156,214,239,277,308,323,386,416,443,522,79,98,429,475,4,36,41,47,116,372,415,59,111,170,179,217,354,383,489,97,144,195,235,324,364,371,414,418,430,459,462,6,34,38,100,278,436,448,458,157,193,198,259,352,370,378,384,387,424,452,479,488,493,504,532,46,264,267,356,16,18,35,58,80,169,293,302,346,420,447,22,29,53,72,189,223,253,450,500,75,231,280,357,388,397,445,42,158,159,226,272,283,285,382,409,425,61,176,245,282,287,366,438,460,13,21,232,233,241,355,396,428,431,432,433,490,508,509,516,531,28,177,187,188,191,151,164,224,229,250,281,297,338,393,472,526,10,33,112,113,216,255,319,337,359,361,380,392,468,481,67,150,163,194,200,270,300,353,401,446,453,521,96,222,251,260,322,347,365,375,404,426,471,20,44,102,246,248,262,314,339,368,376,377,394,395,399,423,19,23,183,228,236,243,244,501,85,225,263,286,299,360,398,444,257,298,331,124,190,212,242,304,333,385,442,523,524,26,99,115,145,192,254,268,291,341,374,441,12,31,63,334,358,402,427,434,499,8,9,326,422,470,511,95,230,345,405,25,125,181,519,535,238,288,295,332,391,469,494,496,196,307,342,367,473,533,186,258,303,330,220,305,316,379,381,464,485,114,306,309,318,451,14,213,227,237,266,335,340,344,525,78,109,110,122,265,296,313,315,437,252,273,312,348,389,421,301,317,327,328,351,32,289,311,329,185,290,373,465,1,218,284,294,320,480,518,534,310,205,247,321,435,439,60,11,390,350,369,325,403,463,7,269,256,343,400,461],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2\n","score":2}]}

Poster prints a single large image or document across multiple pages, usually arranged in a larger format. This is typically used for creating large posters or banners.\n\nThe instructions specifically mention:\n\n\"Print More Than One Page on a Single Sheet of Paper (N in 1) (Windows/Mac)\"\n\"Print as a Poster (Windows/Mac)\"\n\nThe N in 1 option allows you to print multiple pages in a compact format, while the Poster option creates a larger, single-page output.

Instead, it uses a specific pattern of black dots to create the appearance of gray. This method is less memory-intensive and faster, making it suitable for scanning documents with a lot of text or line art where precise gray tones are not critical.\n\n\"True Gray,\" on the other hand, uses up to 256 shades of gray to create a more accurate and detailed grayscale image. This method is more memory-intensive and time-consuming but provides a higher quality image, especially for documents with photographic elements or fine details.\n\nYou might choose \"Gray (Error Diffusion)\" for scenarios where speed and memory efficiency are more important than image quality, such as scanning a large document with mostly text. Conversely, \"True Gray\" would be the better choice for documents containing complex graphics or text with fine details, where image fidelity is crucial.","source":"data/test/mfcj1010dw.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[119,118,24,383,161,141,82,56,111,234,277,505,513,77,386,515,529,378,514,107,165,385,526,377,510,65,166,418,143,349,387,503,92,528,17,123,124,214,274,498,120,159,182,197,275,502,86,127,128,142,149,160,280,3,117,388,4,81,158,169,382,411,496,49,50,121,233,276,278,417,426,485,494,517,520,55,89,136,151,155,164,195,215,231,236,264,493,5,16,22,75,97,153,415,431,459,506,507,512,57,66,103,126,183,223,249,279,491,40,61,64,162,372,406,419,486,500,516,47,62,134,167,184,188,229,288,289,373,414,509,76,115,148,232,408,413,416,464,83,104,163,219,310,438,452,457,21,60,70,84,98,133,146,171,194,209,216,324,325,337,465,54,87,106,145,156,176,208,210,230,356,410,412,443,501,52,137,150,152,217,235,323,379,384,425,2,100,101,112,226,371,374,375,407,497,30,36,73,129,154,221,333,340,381,132,168,174,193,440,531,45,131,139,173,261,287,293,298,331,339,353,391,395,461,51,135,172,181,196,220,250,314,336,362,364,467,15,29,116,130,178,192,199,206,228,237,312,319,330,370,432,476,484,27,41,71,88,224,296,302,95,211,358,508,147,175,186,222,246,332,390,455,492,53,113,424,489,63,357,376,428,472,10,140,225,254,458,483,204,218,309,499,533,8,28,108,138,187,198,511,532,144,202,347,389,474,13,23,227,259,271,338,380,430,456,14,91,96,125,170,180,207,240,300,316,43,201,213,238,404,478,487,504,79,105,157,311,352,519,69,252,255,318,401,530,109,272,527,67,286,317,421,466,475,74,177,313,355,479,521,524,68,94,102,212,409,436,39,93,114,203,245,335,346,453,345,420,477,495,248,256,268,334,348,403,6,37,185,267,304,429,445,523,20,31,190,263,451,482,46,48,90,327,396,400,299,363,392,35,244,292,295,518,9,189,251,283,427,26,44,72,191,243,284,308,322,473,19,481,38,488,80,241,257,365,460,18,239,42,58,290,326,361,297,301,315,423,522,260,285,422,25,99,359,450,179,394,397,398,12,266,306,367,242,303,328,329,368,110,307,354,369,393,434,447,282,405,534,32,200,462,433,446,253,435,439,442,33,281,471,270,344,490,366,448,78,351,525,59,468,7,294,341,1,321,463,85,205,470,11,305,449,122,342,343,291,399,437,441,258,34,265,360,320,350,273,262,402,454,247,444,535,269,469,480],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What is the maximum ambient temperature for operating the TE 2000-22 cordless breaker, and how does this compare to the maximum storage temperature? Discuss the implications of these temperature limits on the tool's performance and longevity in extreme working conditions.","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[26],"raw_output":"","pred":"The maximum ambient temperature for operating the TE 2000-22 cordless breaker is 60°C, while the maximum storage temperature is 70°C. This indicates that the tool can operate within a wider temperature range during use compared to storage. The higher storage temperature limit suggests that the tool can be stored in warmer environments without significant degradation, which is beneficial for users in warmer climates or during summer months.\n\nHowever, the operating temperature limit of 60°C is lower than the storage temperature limit of 70°C. This difference implies that the tool should not be operated in excessively hot conditions, as prolonged exposure to temperatures above 60°C could potentially damage internal components and reduce the tool's performance and longevity. The lower operating temperature limit ensures that the tool functions optimally and safely, preventing overheating and potential malfunctions.\n\nIn extreme working conditions, such as very hot environments, users should be cautious about the tool's operation time and frequency. Overheating can lead to reduced battery life, decreased performance, and increased risk of failure.

{"question":"What potential safety concern could arise if the trunk opener is accidentally activated while driving, and how might this relate to the vehicle's design?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[189],"raw_output":"","pred":"If the trunk opener is accidentally activated while driving, a potential safety concern could be the sudden release of the trunk lid, which could obstruct the driver's view or cause the vehicle to lose balance.  This could lead to a loss of control, increasing the risk of an accident.\n\nThe vehicle's design appears to address this concern by requiring the trunk lid to be fully opened before the trunk opener can be activated.  This prevents the lid from closing under its own weight while driving.  Additionally, the trunk opener is located on the driver's door, which is likely the door the driver is using to operate the vehicle.  This placement makes it less likely for the driver to accidentally activate the trunk opener while driving.\n\nHowever, the manual does caution against using the trunk opener while driving, suggesting that it's not intended for use while the vehicle is in motion.  This further emphasizes the importance of proper usage and the potential hazards of improper operation.\n","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[189,193,88,12,45,47,713,23,221,191,76,454,399,116,452,490,525,634,174,453,82,83,178,192,507,599,766,43,184,190,476,519,524,614,618,627,89,176,179,460,613,745,710,715,743,180,198,620,628,716,9,38,195,239,457,462,470,539,77,492,508,530,641,688,46,471,500,511,529,561,655,744,765,37,177,201,207,209,215,356,445,477,515,520,629,363,458,509,683,724,728,36,81,112,450,491,555,704,769,8,468,472,478,537,540,581,637,697,705,171,196,216,465,687,771,51,75,80,444,526,532,672,14,33,39,242,245,275,528,720,731,42,50,78,479,480,517,681,2,56,98,102,105,154,236,241,435,474,494,590,663,695,722,732,742,34,238,274,330,463,473,475,574,633,691,739,96,204,229,251,259,518,521,538,612,660,685,694,706,725,729,73,93,99,106,108,218,223,447,501,523,578,621,622,675,702,768,48,49,71,111,212,227,286,459,466,502,503,560,575,632,31,57,115,203,222,237,279,439,469,516,531,559,605,606,609,615,700,723,734,735,767,113,181,183,194,199,244,253,270,400,404,527,548,549,585,607,610,616,619,642,667,740,770,18,53,61,69,87,94,97,187,231,335,401,455,461,536,567,593,608,611,631,650,699,730,737,74,103,104,143,200,210,220,224,243,314,347,353,449,451,506,522,556,577,601,626,649,658,709,719,22,127,219,225,235,325,425,557,565,584,589,592,635,664,693,754,16,52,197,396,456,533,569,573,598,624,668,15,59,62,66,86,95,160,202,228,339,437,446,467,495,498,499,544,580,583,726,733,5,30,85,92,110,128,161,248,348,440,443,493,497,510,513,550,568,673,714,748,755,756,7,10,107,109,166,234,328,331,355,405,422,482,535,639,640,659,662,689,60,67,101,313,402,441,504,554,596,602,603,711,750,17,24,54,55,58,142,155,182,205,208,240,340,407,486,512,579,582,591,647,657,692,703,721,35,41,44,79,100,129,134,162,185,211,280,282,427,431,563,651,686,712,747,762,63,72,121,169,186,188,324,341,542,562,576,586,594,623,764,21,65,117,175,297,309,343,350,370,394,403,483,543,570,588,595,630,643,701,708,717,4,29,32,139,281,292,305,364,393,464,481,484,505,547,564,644,698,727,84,278,600,684,25,126,213,214,249,277,349,636,665,690,752,757,68,333,426,432,545,566,114,120,334,417,448,587,604,13,255,306,357,485,707,170,271,423,496,514,666,760,6,27,137,141,164,206,252,276,283,534,625,736,741,140,168,217,377,420,424,656,159,254,268,327,329,408,546,654,759,20,70,118,131,246,263,391,395,414,153,354,438,541,551,597,676,144,148,267,326,617,165,250,303,352,374,409,558,572,680,138,304,390,429,488,652,679,19,167,226,264,298,552,645,653,671,718,40,247,338,346,489,682,753,262,362,436,487,669,758,91,132,285,337,389,661,28,152,289,296,315,382,442,738,119,147,172,230,293,307,332,342,367,380,383,398,406,412,11,90,123,257,295,670,751,3,151,232,320,360,366,421,571,150,156,233,319,371,387,392,284,291,299,323,358,369,411,157,317,345,379,419,677,746,135,301,310,434,553,638,646,674,258,272,26,133,378,433,749,136,149,163,410,415,648,772,64,428,311,361,418,696,158,318,321,678,124,294,302,336,368,122,273,308,416,761,773,125,265,269,365,130,146,288,381,385,397,344,384,430,145,256,413,1,173,359,351,763,260,287,261,372,373,266,316,290,322,388,376,300,375,312,386],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What is the key difference between the WARNING and CAUTION safety messages in terms of potential consequences?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[7],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key difference between WARNING and CAUTION safety messages lies in the potential severity of the consequences if the instructions are not followed.\n\nA WARNING message indicates a higher risk of serious injury or death. It uses the phrase \"You CAN be KILLED or SERIOUSLY HURT if you don't follow instructions.\" This suggests that the hazard poses a significant threat to life or severe bodily harm.\n\nIn contrast, a CAUTION message indicates a lower risk of injury. It uses the phrase \"You CAN be HURT if you don't follow instructions.\" This implies that while there is a risk of injury, it is generally less severe than the potential consequences of a WARNING.\n\nThe WARNING symbol is used to alert the reader to a potentially life-threatening situation, requiring immediate attention and adherence to the instructions to avoid serious harm. The CAUTION symbol, on the other hand, is used for situations where there is a risk of injury, but it is not as severe as a WARNING. It serves as a reminder to exercise caution and follow the instructions to prevent minor injuries.\n\nIn summary, WARNING messages carry a higher level of urgency and potential severity, while CAUTION messages provide a more moderate level of caution and risk.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[7,620,89,223,241,242,713,2,452,627,681,687,218,641,229,525,655,225,519,685,76,694,46,77,78,88,198,538,745,195,220,54,75,215,559,614,675,683,688,613,224,539,52,71,86,634,663,710,716,80,237,702,704,724,728,729,709,679,81,231,447,742,115,45,767,660,692,139,458,530,391,10,770,465,526,363,667,238,507,533,659,695,154,699,625,642,42,399,449,500,192,633,93,116,730,457,666,120,462,200,621,665,210,251,510,33,43,103,137,444,731,235,673,121,618,4,168,664,715,371,392,492,518,520,57,460,593,651,189,202,591,637,697,580,706,740,119,578,62,184,365,366,446,480,70,155,239,60,498,508,590,201,509,521,769,47,445,771,41,44,79,180,362,628,768,543,153,364,439,6,512,515,165,658,87,564,605,211,735,191,74,221,602,174,606,368,529,575,199,689,754,53,66,370,471,524,528,733,9,454,493,558,607,686,140,194,31,501,766,18,167,222,236,676,691,726,760,48,443,622,22,82,188,517,574,581,56,393,437,477,572,705,737,34,128,185,274,490,549,555,556,759,176,227,755,72,504,553,568,39,65,92,141,339,662,732,68,95,514,537,560,563,213,455,466,494,540,557,113,209,420,435,511,548,576,629,636,657,693,207,252,297,491,764,5,30,59,106,111,161,193,369,506,544,567,569,104,570,61,83,85,96,127,186,292,516,551,684,19,50,51,98,205,214,325,531,536,612,722,765,110,226,389,532,36,112,286,573,616,656,100,208,245,261,441,499,561,600,609,611,624,649,197,545,585,668,682,707,734,8,259,343,358,394,402,463,474,523,550,577,166,243,360,422,650,102,160,179,349,396,450,472,604,49,63,69,196,248,342,359,440,467,565,571,626,630,73,94,108,117,203,240,459,470,505,547,554,601,615,669,16,109,190,244,301,361,588,67,277,320,374,423,453,478,594,599,632,743,12,84,118,134,171,282,348,496,503,592,748,15,20,37,99,328,424,541,595,639,3,177,183,246,305,382,403,476,562,610,678,750,181,206,285,404,487,534,542,603,631,24,101,175,253,268,304,482,483,597,635,647,720,723,212,338,390,414,427,527,640,714,753,129,143,170,522,546,552,566,587,623,216,276,278,497,596,690,58,105,270,379,535,579,619,677,38,131,135,162,232,323,345,381,385,586,712,727,142,233,350,398,456,747,29,182,187,217,247,298,395,407,461,643,725,756,758,136,164,234,306,319,335,513,598,752,14,178,230,280,321,330,333,367,469,701,11,173,341,405,408,481,489,354,739,749,772,281,293,356,648,718,744,55,228,266,307,337,388,479,608,646,21,25,126,157,159,303,340,373,473,711,719,762,97,169,250,279,428,584,721,736,751,132,156,219,347,411,475,495,32,275,283,295,302,327,375,432,448,464,589,670,708,172,204,352,377,413,23,123,271,355,376,434,438,451,583,698,310,378,380,417,436,468,484,486,502,617,653,17,107,122,148,289,353,387,409,416,288,318,334,372,421,433,680,114,133,147,151,158,255,263,267,299,314,410,485,700,717,149,265,291,357,397,415,671,757,260,313,317,351,401,442,488,582,672,1,144,331,344,346,383,384,400,418,425,430,644,26,138,294,315,324,13,124,125,150,284,296,308,431,652,674,761,773,249,419,429,661,90,309,654,696,290,386,412,254,287,763,40,152,264,645,741,130,329,426,273,322,326,746,28,145,257,258,638,316,262,269,272,35,703,163,300,406,311,27,738,64,332,336,146,312,256,91],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Strong radio waves from nearby equipment: This could interfere with the keyless remote's signal, making it difficult for the vehicle to locate and communicate with the remote.\n\n2. Carrying the keyless remote with telecommunications equipment, laptop computers, cell phones, or wireless devices: These devices emit radio waves that can interfere with the keyless remote's signal, causing communication issues.\n\n3. A metallic object touching or covering the keyless remote: Metal can block or reflect the keyless remote's signal, reducing its effectiveness in communicating with the vehicle.\n\nThese factors can inhibit the keyless remote's ability to start the engine, lock and unlock doors and fuel fill door, and open the trunk. It's important to avoid placing the keyless remote near electrical appliances and to keep it away from devices that emit strong radio waves to maintain optimal signal strength and functionality.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[176,184,199,450,451,180,190,721,183,452,454,719,178,201,171,38,192,179,769,196,177,182,239,198,687,175,193,455,174,453,697,200,396,181,143,356,634,503,363,727,404,439,43,628,401,424,142,194,205,399,772,422,514,768,9,23,237,537,195,601,618,602,605,770,238,263,394,445,460,462,549,568,311,457,633,685,71,236,499,529,710,744,75,209,241,251,339,523,526,567,600,607,732,37,39,76,297,313,374,444,465,491,500,528,530,531,598,603,622,639,695,725,731,106,116,129,162,342,432,446,478,651,3,207,223,242,309,402,407,472,519,536,548,599,756,2,62,77,220,250,253,427,521,578,589,608,641,681,686,689,713,22,46,197,210,281,306,425,476,493,524,612,656,742,745,764,7,208,222,240,270,355,360,468,513,532,574,606,613,728,735,766,771,29,47,52,56,74,89,286,330,364,400,414,520,525,590,611,620,675,691,706,726,45,48,68,113,212,262,276,352,354,458,470,498,501,507,512,683,729,42,60,66,72,203,346,350,435,463,490,492,515,587,665,694,716,723,765,54,65,88,98,221,259,348,412,466,555,586,614,640,660,688,722,36,59,204,243,246,249,275,277,325,340,406,440,594,595,629,663,720,740,33,49,50,51,58,166,254,341,405,480,539,540,544,579,636,655,662,666,692,714,733,31,57,104,141,317,334,344,349,362,417,436,441,494,585,593,610,627,754,5,8,61,97,100,101,111,188,244,274,336,357,418,535,560,626,699,11,34,35,63,80,81,92,93,102,115,189,191,202,213,215,218,235,282,345,351,474,516,517,522,631,650,690,753,99,105,108,245,280,337,338,367,403,423,447,504,559,730,69,73,95,103,147,155,187,257,258,271,332,333,343,416,420,426,431,433,437,438,459,461,511,534,561,565,596,724,743,758,767,26,256,361,398,550,581,592,609,623,625,635,637,711,21,25,30,82,387,430,443,477,527,664,693,32,225,314,377,428,508,518,556,667,86,96,145,211,285,320,321,464,538,734,14,125,273,283,365,408,471,569,704,715,755,759,83,206,409,421,547,588,702,739,15,67,78,112,123,127,224,411,543,545,619,53,107,310,456,615,680,705,18,134,227,229,307,347,415,429,533,564,573,647,128,216,248,331,371,410,413,576,616,709,747,159,278,295,475,575,584,649,44,79,137,255,279,632,679,335,382,434,467,469,643,677,707,757,16,154,370,380,381,558,186,214,294,366,368,473,510,644,673,703,717,737,109,157,217,292,392,419,479,485,580,604,668,736,4,247,316,324,393,448,566,748,10,27,94,135,167,353,488,583,597,110,160,161,305,509,542,773,17,87,117,298,304,551,557,642,657,762,231,272,328,506,684,12,119,164,252,481,570,138,288,293,326,487,502,630,652,674,41,131,132,168,301,329,358,373,140,266,299,319,378,483,496,554,563,582,760,126,153,264,269,289,296,379,384,391,497,149,226,359,449,659,669,741,6,139,233,234,383,624,712,120,185,390,148,267,284,486,621,750,303,327,591,708,28,85,505,701,24,219,369,553,700,156,232,287,291,318,676,55,118,133,136,150,312,315,386,752,114,122,385,388,389,484,670,121,169,395,482,84,90,322,572,577,19,20,268,302,323,397,617,144,228,495,638,672,682,761,146,151,230,489,546,648,13,40,124,265,571,170,172,442,552,671,165,541,70,152,260,308,696,698,738,372,261,678,718,751,646,658,91,746,376,653,130,290,173,749,1,300,562,645,654,64,763,163,375,661,158],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This feature allows for customization to either unlock only the driver's door or all doors simultaneously.\n\nChanging the setting of this feature can significantly affect the user's experience when approaching their vehicle. If the setting is changed to unlock only the driver's door, the user will need to grab the driver's door handle to unlock the driver's door, and then they will need to use the key or keyless entry system to unlock the remaining doors.

However, it may require the driver to be more cautious when approaching the vehicle to avoid accidentally unlocking all doors.\n\nOverall, the choice of setting depends on the user's preference for convenience and security.","source":"data/test/civic_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[394,142,181,182,178,186,396,143,188,388,304,766,205,261,183,227,129,179,193,177,259,509,175,196,764,214,162,392,453,174,200,387,286,577,180,197,288,460,489,545,631,176,540,541,573,584,147,171,531,594,14,136,169,222,278,323,452,457,502,530,556,611,634,138,199,314,496,558,600,38,45,150,305,343,377,379,395,454,459,470,481,491,563,564,583,739,145,160,285,405,424,492,505,520,574,575,606,629,21,298,380,393,461,490,495,543,189,201,282,320,383,412,445,462,485,516,542,576,593,596,619,623,30,139,140,217,313,378,487,544,557,571,578,580,110,115,144,184,198,276,390,432,458,488,515,527,560,561,590,630,723,106,116,190,204,341,406,410,450,513,570,586,603,614,616,768,206,274,350,427,439,486,497,549,555,582,589,591,598,612,118,127,172,382,425,431,465,476,483,510,518,522,533,538,562,769,93,159,185,192,249,398,408,475,524,548,551,552,602,624,37,88,141,213,241,321,340,352,391,455,469,493,553,554,567,579,581,592,617,620,114,168,187,239,289,290,338,346,363,404,463,468,501,534,610,613,622,627,651,120,137,151,194,209,216,275,293,299,397,500,506,511,512,517,559,625,644,652,690,721,740,743,23,73,170,173,211,235,243,303,332,348,389,441,478,479,484,521,525,536,565,599,609,621,626,736,744,97,203,207,210,240,280,315,329,331,333,464,471,507,528,546,601,604,628,772,12,27,34,48,123,191,281,284,334,356,384,385,435,447,451,456,466,477,508,526,529,539,550,587,608,615,618,702,706,32,152,251,271,292,307,417,434,436,440,443,449,472,474,480,482,503,605,632,635,645,716,745,195,212,242,309,312,319,327,407,494,498,499,523,643,756,767,9,20,29,49,58,92,126,247,258,295,318,418,421,519,532,537,547,566,637,673,674,710,17,125,148,154,236,254,270,301,325,326,381,420,438,467,535,585,722,8,244,252,262,360,473,568,569,607,718,132,155,228,263,273,283,310,322,330,400,504,588,686,695,33,47,157,245,253,260,317,337,386,399,414,444,446,448,595,711,2,3,5,22,65,71,102,104,119,246,429,597,699,742,765,153,208,215,234,409,514,704,727,112,238,255,306,311,349,403,419,422,423,688,697,713,726,770,26,67,94,105,133,149,264,266,291,324,344,345,354,426,633,665,668,672,748,771,15,31,76,135,411,433,655,676,708,719,24,25,98,117,146,156,231,257,267,287,402,636,646,649,660,53,131,218,269,294,335,351,416,572,691,694,731,69,83,108,122,272,316,353,374,700,724,725,6,72,85,89,99,113,128,161,202,297,358,413,415,693,728,735,52,56,158,342,361,437,641,647,683,712,720,729,77,109,121,164,166,223,250,256,277,279,328,362,430,715,50,124,226,229,265,685,689,732,754,19,61,111,220,221,237,268,336,640,705,750,36,54,64,82,101,296,347,355,658,675,682,730,733,28,51,63,219,230,300,339,656,707,16,43,96,165,357,648,662,664,698,4,44,46,60,68,74,95,107,248,428,650,687,734,738,753,11,59,66,370,701,714,717,39,42,57,75,130,232,657,681,10,79,134,167,224,233,302,364,371,401,667,55,62,70,100,679,680,757,758,759,773,87,225,639,642,684,18,35,80,308,367,13,84,163,372,659,663,666,678,709,78,103,677,741,41,661,762,91,703,752,365,692,359,669,86,366,7,81,368,369,737,751,760,755,761,671,749,376,747,670,40,90,654,763,1,375,638,653,373,442,696,746],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Navigate to the \"Print\" or \"Print Setup\" option in your application or operating system.\n\n2. **Choose the Paper Size**: Select the paper size that corresponds to the desired output size for each sheet. For the smaller size, choose a smaller paper size, and for the larger size, choose a larger paper size.\n\n3. **Adjust the Scaling**: In the printer driver settings, look for an option to adjust the scaling or page size. This option allows you to specify how the document should be scaled to fit the selected paper size. Ensure that the scaling is set to \"Fit to Page\" or \"Scale to Fit\" to maintain the original layout and proportions.\n\n4. **Print the Smaller Size**: Print the document on the smaller paper size. This will ensure that the pie chart and other elements are scaled down to fit the smaller sheet while maintaining their original proportions.\n\n5. **Print the Larger Size**: Print the document on the larger paper size. This will ensure that the pie chart and other elements are scaled up to fit the larger sheet while maintaining their original proportions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can print the document in both smaller and larger sizes while preserving the layout and proportions of the original document.","source":"data/test/workforce_pro_wf4830_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[68,284,50,76,40,75,48,64,46,47,65,41,67,87,69,58,212,55,117,38,49,66,56,214,60,85,211,44,57,39,219,111,223,123,86,52,54,210,314,27,124,45,81,277,63,74,82,220,121,209,118,225,53,70,205,213,311,42,181,218,276,28,216,8,154,285,291,37,149,51,83,84,162,202,208,200,224,228,2,29,259,59,91,148,94,108,120,147,315,341,122,260,350,43,130,329,73,203,263,22,100,283,23,112,222,26,61,77,97,106,221,227,261,298,72,229,249,32,71,93,199,238,316,328,6,35,204,215,248,267,290,322,323,18,266,286,339,3,62,178,333,80,99,256,270,289,310,325,358,362,194,279,331,353,24,98,166,183,288,312,334,337,342,354,30,110,116,179,262,281,330,336,1,78,90,92,109,127,133,165,193,217,321,324,344,4,5,157,159,195,245,287,355,190,268,278,292,313,326,96,115,128,145,152,197,332,335,338,351,359,105,129,132,172,206,244,343,352,363,36,198,226,241,327,182,345,14,21,33,95,177,207,305,317,340,348,367,131,237,240,251,275,114,119,253,257,365,15,20,34,101,142,155,185,196,201,231,252,293,349,366,12,138,176,233,250,271,274,282,309,347,381,156,169,184,247,346,370,380,126,186,230,258,299,300,139,163,235,239,265,360,368,372,25,31,125,135,137,160,168,180,269,371,376,7,17,146,255,318,13,151,189,356,79,89,102,191,296,301,136,173,272,280,319,382,104,141,153,254,307,164,187,234,242,246,16,144,297,308,320,357,364,375,88,134,243,273,304,361,374,143,161,306,378,107,150,167,170,192,383,174,175,188,373,140,158,113,171,232,236,264,377,11,103,303,295,369,379,10,19,294,302,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This streamlined interface can be particularly beneficial for users with a large number of contacts to manage.\n\nIn summary, the printer's control panel is the most suitable tool for users needing to prioritize frequently used destinations while handling a large contact list, due to its sorting functionality and dedicated interface for contact management.","source":"data/test/workforce_pro_wf4830_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[338,341,339,342,290,337,340,328,351,116,343,344,90,93,105,345,22,89,118,24,236,40,109,333,346,117,234,286,38,281,289,322,332,8,39,122,317,178,196,269,3,23,155,244,257,313,352,41,166,182,232,241,370,43,50,58,106,157,245,253,282,307,347,362,366,46,65,66,124,185,330,371,35,63,99,176,240,256,277,312,314,372,5,57,92,162,237,44,75,86,91,101,108,151,156,168,278,310,350,21,81,172,198,248,306,355,359,158,318,324,336,47,114,165,285,311,374,2,76,247,273,68,111,159,190,231,252,271,294,382,42,83,203,243,326,121,164,246,379,138,152,180,238,335,361,77,268,378,82,94,249,287,64,125,255,363,364,369,375,189,233,298,315,321,331,67,206,279,381,48,179,191,230,284,329,349,376,181,199,275,368,32,254,325,14,272,293,327,15,210,309,353,373,97,123,235,266,276,319,323,348,153,280,354,7,207,218,219,334,60,85,149,163,204,205,239,242,320,358,380,27,45,98,212,213,297,304,308,30,193,267,283,95,127,186,209,265,383,59,211,214,288,360,365,377,69,71,74,139,161,29,62,72,84,169,296,28,37,70,107,160,177,187,20,367,61,87,154,173,216,36,110,141,223,96,112,170,229,102,113,132,4,49,80,133,174,250,263,316,357,188,195,270,303,120,130,150,175,183,227,356,73,100,115,167,208,220,222,295,126,260,1,33,184,228,52,197,305,119,134,259,56,142,200,13,88,128,137,147,148,171,215,274,135,144,18,221,217,251,131,136,202,225,300,129,6,145,192,194,140,299,51,79,224,261,291,78,226,146,25,19,104,264,262,34,53,10,16,54,55,17,292,12,201,26,143,103,11,258,9,31,302,301],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

By freezing food in smaller, manageable portions, you can use it as needed without having to thaw large quantities.\n\n2. **Pack the food in an airtight manner to prevent them from drying even if they are going to be stored for a short time.** Airtight packaging helps maintain the food's moisture content, preventing dehydration and spoilage. This is particularly important for short-term storage, as even a few days of exposure to air can cause food to dry out and lose its texture and flavor.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can ensure that your frozen food remains fresh and retains its quality for longer periods, making it a convenient and efficient way to store and preserve food.","source":"data/test/bffd3624ss.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[24,3,25,55,86,65,23,34,85,28,51,56,20,26,82,57,59,33,54,87,8,38,69,77,90,68,19,88,7,30,58,61,50,64,81,9,15,27,37,52,79,71,47,89,16,92,62,70,78,2,46,53,39,60,84,22,6,83,91,40,35,17,36,21,49,29,48,80,18,63,42,41,93,66,4,31,94,5,10,1,67,45,13,32,73,44,72,74,75,11,43,12,14,76],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of using the \"Continuous\" file numbering method compared to the \"Auto reset\" and \"Manual reset\" methods when managing large volumes of images across multiple memory cards and folders?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[186],"raw_output":"","pred":"Continuous file numbering offers several advantages when managing large volumes of images across multiple memory cards and folders. It ensures that file numbers continue sequentially, making it easier to organize and locate images. This method is particularly useful for long-term projects or when images need to be easily identifiable and searchable. It also simplifies the process of transferring images to a computer, as the file numbering system remains consistent.\n\nHowever, there are potential disadvantages to consider. If the memory card or folder already contains images, the file numbering may continue from the existing images, potentially overwriting or confusing the numbering system. This can be problematic if the user needs to maintain a strict file numbering order.\n\nIn contrast, the \"Auto reset\" method restarts the file numbering from 0001 each time the card is replaced or a new folder is created. This can be advantageous for organizing images by cards or folders, ensuring a clean start for each new set of images. However, it may not be ideal for long-term projects where maintaining a consistent file numbering system is crucial.\n\nThe \"Manual reset\" method allows for a more controlled approach, where the user can reset the file numbering to 0001 manually or start from file number 0001 in a new folder. This provides flexibility but requires manual intervention, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors if not done consistently.\n\nIn summary, Continuous numbering is best for maintaining a consistent and easily identifiable numbering system, while Auto reset and Manual reset offer more flexibility in organizing images by cards or folders, but may require more careful management to avoid confusion.","source":"data/test/eos_4000d.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[186,295,187,278,316,193,52,184,297,318,269,12,181,195,15,17,65,185,288,315,117,290,2,10,285,87,242,317,73,118,252,134,271,171,319,138,180,100,167,230,245,250,273,235,28,248,289,53,101,174,112,202,5,39,261,283,292,66,40,194,277,280,299,38,50,74,154,213,237,279,298,13,88,142,149,166,221,85,96,182,220,259,89,90,145,161,162,165,170,222,249,169,175,286,139,207,268,11,57,61,71,179,198,211,217,253,282,47,158,209,251,8,103,146,173,176,218,246,272,276,284,48,55,60,83,92,99,133,231,239,243,263,287,6,59,79,131,140,212,215,227,16,63,148,155,188,229,264,18,19,24,54,86,121,168,190,226,254,293,41,192,256,296,91,97,128,143,160,214,219,244,281,37,68,111,113,123,191,203,223,225,241,294,30,44,104,163,201,260,313,98,216,228,234,257,258,14,51,70,115,156,196,210,233,265,314,36,64,95,159,164,178,200,247,304,34,130,135,152,183,58,110,147,310,4,62,69,72,75,109,116,172,206,270,275,300,35,42,67,114,122,151,199,208,23,76,189,80,94,127,144,150,224,312,7,9,21,49,129,141,153,157,236,240,20,25,197,262,27,204,320,1,93,124,321,82,45,102,108,177,255,29,132,301,303,126,205,238,77,78,119,307,291,322,106,107,308,137,302,309,3,232,56,136,266,22,43,84,305,81,105,306,120,267,311,46,32,125,274,26,31,33],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This is significantly lower than the capacity for standard plain paper sheets, which is approximately 50 sheets. The reduced capacity for legal-sized paper is likely due to the smaller size of legal paper compared to standard paper, which may affect the printer's ability to handle the paper stack efficiently. The lower capacity ensures that the printer can manage the smaller paper size without encountering feeding issues or paper jams.

It can also help in adjusting the exposure and white balance more accurately before taking the shot.\n\nHowever, there are potential drawbacks to consider. The colors and tones in the monitor may differ significantly from the final image, which can be confusing for some photographers. Additionally, the display may need to be adjusted to show the effects of monochrome and sepia settings, which could be distracting or misleading.\n\nPhotographers might choose to enable \"NATURAL LIVE VIEW\" in scenarios where they want to preview the effects of their settings, such as when using film simulation or adjusting white balance. They might disable it in situations where they need to focus on the actual exposure and white balance, such as when using a flash with an incandescent monitoring lamp, where both exposure and white balance are likely to change during shooting.","source":"data/test/x100vi.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[313,353,23,10,349,53,202,60,204,199,332,224,314,383,219,360,159,176,158,177,54,207,310,346,352,44,131,312,58,90,179,234,415,247,309,55,194,296,359,39,142,190,306,320,362,376,397,413,228,269,326,382,34,47,161,175,178,188,196,291,13,19,49,56,85,122,134,169,192,317,325,343,345,43,154,198,227,233,300,324,328,350,38,220,303,365,35,76,193,217,230,232,341,364,6,11,48,99,156,236,339,24,51,189,197,206,221,302,368,380,381,28,42,73,97,184,214,267,290,292,305,323,354,369,5,33,45,50,124,133,136,182,191,225,244,18,32,72,104,116,138,218,254,294,318,40,64,98,100,121,128,150,185,276,307,316,331,333,384,402,9,37,61,83,127,129,141,155,201,203,246,258,295,299,315,327,7,93,147,160,162,388,400,4,16,109,164,172,183,231,240,243,262,336,361,363,396,403,20,52,88,96,102,117,144,186,205,266,321,358,389,15,36,59,77,80,92,103,216,285,293,329,330,366,395,8,113,132,140,143,180,210,270,319,377,399,25,31,101,105,108,118,135,209,342,356,385,392,14,70,86,112,119,126,149,165,167,200,238,239,322,106,107,151,257,334,338,344,387,391,398,408,12,75,89,111,120,123,187,241,274,279,298,57,65,153,208,212,222,242,286,351,401,409,46,68,74,91,137,235,255,263,289,308,379,390,114,115,157,174,181,253,268,277,283,367,393,62,69,81,130,223,272,282,284,378,226,304,22,27,30,71,152,163,171,195,215,229,252,273,281,288,347,412,1,82,125,173,278,287,374,417,17,84,280,348,375,386,405,407,146,211,213,256,275,394,66,94,110,170,261,357,373,416,41,168,311,335,372,3,21,139,250,404,67,260,271,411,301,406,166,420,2,248,265,245,249,259,87,148,355,410,340,78,251,418,419,297,237,264,370,414,26,95,145,371,79,337,29,63],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"4","score":4},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

The other options, such as ANIMAL, BIRD, AUTOMOBILE, AIRPLANE, and TRAIN, are less relevant for a velodrome setting, as they are more focused on detecting and tracking specific types of subjects that are not typically present at a velodrome.","source":"data/test/x100vi.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[179,180,396,346,109,345,17,178,58,227,341,7,121,321,225,150,20,92,353,177,5,202,154,349,332,339,130,171,239,104,144,108,134,136,158,380,347,115,359,96,172,306,56,118,34,305,186,328,351,364,59,65,116,216,314,327,112,117,219,330,30,82,102,176,191,378,111,142,228,40,90,110,210,226,230,284,313,368,397,282,362,98,125,199,256,381,383,33,100,105,181,262,307,342,360,89,207,229,320,138,175,335,395,15,132,308,344,413,28,35,39,106,133,193,310,23,48,53,64,141,143,188,189,192,201,220,254,399,43,45,47,54,183,194,197,231,382,42,107,204,218,252,259,261,316,317,365,388,400,403,24,103,113,114,124,149,182,198,224,81,129,147,160,162,221,234,247,291,304,311,9,19,122,156,184,212,232,283,300,325,6,51,135,152,161,205,248,260,281,319,324,402,32,50,127,173,213,270,309,312,315,329,389,38,46,57,88,174,272,279,285,318,334,49,52,61,165,195,257,271,302,323,348,126,146,164,196,303,361,363,404,415,16,31,78,119,120,153,241,249,264,277,336,72,83,99,140,233,244,299,326,369,18,55,131,139,151,159,187,203,263,340,419,8,60,86,93,137,157,214,236,242,245,287,343,356,379,76,170,217,243,255,288,296,350,36,37,223,274,278,290,293,398,11,44,155,163,185,208,267,280,333,357,169,253,275,370,409,101,166,206,222,294,77,80,97,209,238,331,366,62,123,258,286,292,358,367,10,22,128,190,354,411,418,68,85,235,2,74,94,167,289,298,322,338,387,168,215,269,352,391,408,4,69,73,211,250,25,75,384,386,1,95,251,276,412,67,301,385,394,3,13,66,355,63,200,14,406,21,41,84,392,401,240,246,374,410,145,372,71,268,12,295,79,148,417,393,91,405,29,70,297,390,273,373,407,371,265,376,420,87,375,266,337,377,414,26,27,237,416],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"How does RTT differ from traditional text messaging in a way that impacts its usage during phone calls?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[235],"raw_output":"","pred":"RTT (Real-Time Text) differs from traditional text messaging in several key ways that impact its usage during phone calls:\n\n1. Simultaneous communication: Unlike traditional text messaging, where messages are exchanged after the call ends, RTT allows you to type and send messages in real-time while the call is ongoing. This enables continuous conversation and immediate feedback.\n\n2. Call minutes: RTT uses call minutes, just like a regular voice call, whereas traditional text messaging does not consume call time.\n\n3. No additional accessories: RTT doesn't require any special accessories, making it more convenient and accessible compared to traditional text messaging.\n\n4. Visibility of typing: The recipient can see your typing as you type, which can be helpful for understanding the flow of the conversation and responding more quickly.\n\n5. Text entry during call: You can enter messages directly into the text field while the call is active, allowing for seamless integration of text communication within the call.\n\n6. Call control options: During a call, you can use various controls like muting, speakerphone, and adding calls directly from the RTT interface.\n\nThese differences make RTT particularly useful for scenarios where quick, continuous text communication is needed during a call, such as for customer service, emergency calls, or for people with hearing impairments who prefer text-based communication.","source":"data/test/moto_g_play.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[235,80,106,132,145,5,133,136,4,134,140,299,100,142,37,104,173,141,143,137,236,278,144,148,276,205,147,211,46,146,290,135,279,209,99,314,295,268,293,298,81,126,296,8,149,107,139,233,175,57,150,234,60,138,151,166,199,228,292,84,176,179,184,20,24,103,161,237,187,260,102,181,101,131,162,83,232,30,65,33,275,50,74,76,97,22,58,130,294,23,85,105,128,204,216,3,6,39,178,188,170,28,154,156,157,108,203,127,165,283,320,121,212,226,301,313,59,77,89,114,169,177,210,64,69,155,189,230,35,289,92,215,231,266,305,55,73,171,291,14,44,164,185,207,315,82,94,214,222,72,158,193,225,312,15,29,38,54,129,220,68,163,191,194,267,319,66,242,246,259,16,95,125,218,197,240,287,19,36,116,123,113,153,201,224,308,53,117,119,253,323,2,34,51,91,186,264,45,63,152,182,239,241,265,43,172,272,61,87,160,244,47,124,196,200,202,219,227,263,284,288,21,52,56,168,195,261,322,31,49,109,120,247,285,317,75,88,111,206,248,67,110,221,274,318,7,13,18,41,79,115,269,282,316,11,26,40,71,86,208,277,286,303,10,118,307,42,62,70,78,300,9,198,229,251,321,17,112,174,180,254,310,12,96,245,159,32,90,250,255,256,257,270,273,297,311,249,252,271,304,27,183,217,258,302,223,262,25,122,192,213,280,281,306,48,309,93,190,98,167,1,243,238],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

However, the maximum theoretical limit based on the information provided is 10 warning messages.","source":"data/test/pixpro_astro_zoom_az425.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[88,91,89,90,92,65,93,31,8,77,4,12,42,51,58,86,48,5,49,85,87,57,68,83,2,50,7,33,26,52,66,56,64,82,84,6,38,78,34,11,20,22,27,75,80,13,44,28,9,67,63,10,21,41,46,40,43,18,45,62,32,39,16,36,47,70,54,37,60,69,1,29,14,3,15,61,25,79,71,81,74,19,35,17,30,59,73,24,55,72,76,23,53,94],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 3","score":3},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}
{"question":"Which scene mode would be most appropriate for capturing a close-up photo of a small object in low light conditions, and why?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[33],"raw_output":"","pred":"Macro Mode would be the most appropriate scene mode for capturing a close-up photo of a small object in low light conditions.  This mode is specifically designed for shooting small objects or extreme close-up photos.  It allows the camera to focus on subjects very close to the lens, providing detailed images.  Additionally, Macro Mode often has settings that optimize for low light, such as higher ISO values, to ensure the best possible image quality in dim environments.  While other modes like Night Landscape or Night Portrait might also be suitable for low light, they are generally more focused on capturing entire scenes rather than close-up details of small objects.  Macro Mode's primary focus on close-up photography and its ability to handle low light make it the ideal choice for this specific scenario.\n","source":"data/test/pixpro_astro_zoom_az425.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[33,58,34,39,32,66,42,41,45,61,67,59,44,48,92,38,43,64,25,46,71,85,27,47,10,21,26,72,37,70,30,40,4,56,68,29,51,75,35,86,31,62,78,88,57,14,79,28,20,60,63,5,7,52,53,8,77,82,17,19,83,89,9,6,22,50,49,69,84,1,80,65,90,36,91,15,13,18,54,73,87,55,76,11,93,2,16,12,81,23,24,74,3,94],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"How does the image resolution setting impact both the quality of printed photos and the storage capacity on a memory card, and why might a photographer choose a lower resolution setting despite the potential decrease in image quality?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[57],"raw_output":"","pred":"The image resolution setting directly impacts both the quality of printed photos and the storage capacity on a memory card. A higher resolution, such as 20M (5184 x 3888 pixels), allows for larger prints without degrading the photo quality. This is because the higher pixel count provides more detail and clarity, making the image appear sharper and more defined. Conversely, a lower resolution, like VGA (640 x 480 pixels), results in smaller prints and potentially lower image quality, as the fewer pixels mean less detail and a grainier appearance.\n\nThe storage capacity on a memory card is also influenced by the image resolution. A higher resolution setting uses more storage space because each pixel requires more memory to store. For example, a 20M resolution image uses approximately 5.5MB of storage, while a VGA image uses only 20KB. Therefore, a photographer might choose a lower resolution setting to maximize the number of images they can store on a memory card, which is particularly useful for capturing more moments during events or when the storage capacity is limited. However, this trade-off between storage capacity and image quality should be carefully considered based on the specific needs of the photographer.","source":"data/test/pixpro_astro_zoom_az425.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[57,65,71,75,60,26,70,27,47,28,58,92,45,4,72,18,91,6,49,90,78,82,93,62,83,11,66,73,85,29,5,44,52,87,9,12,17,77,32,1,37,20,67,89,25,7,31,39,46,61,68,69,19,41,51,21,33,55,48,80,10,35,36,42,63,86,34,50,74,13,30,38,59,64,81,14,84,40,43,53,3,88,79,8,56,15,22,16,54,2,24,76,94,23],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

Remove any visible hair or debris and switch off and on the appliance to see if the problem resolves.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the i2 error code and ensure that your appliance functions correctly.","source":"data/test/aquatrio_cordless_9000_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[37,44,81,24,26,41,23,27,171,217,40,43,36,537,42,218,446,492,47,263,229,354,478,160,264,25,581,626,6,355,491,170,401,68,432,38,126,159,208,250,310,419,523,572,10,177,205,297,496,568,612,125,178,300,481,527,112,157,204,237,341,389,418,524,569,13,51,69,140,225,254,387,388,436,630,176,179,219,296,445,479,480,551,571,116,144,161,206,221,309,345,363,449,614,632,95,194,298,370,402,434,435,482,495,500,536,541,595,48,71,72,99,113,114,137,174,191,226,265,286,373,391,400,450,493,506,570,12,115,147,199,210,222,223,279,361,374,461,497,498,499,503,526,613,55,80,129,131,207,233,299,324,406,465,468,525,555,616,9,20,54,70,87,130,224,230,239,267,283,285,360,390,405,408,599,615,132,190,253,270,272,315,328,343,358,404,454,625,19,86,415,467,510,544,633,45,143,184,187,214,252,313,327,344,407,452,473,542,554,598,610,629,133,172,212,240,268,411,543,600,631,21,29,58,88,101,127,209,282,377,440,462,464,102,110,146,193,228,248,275,359,376,430,484,509,540,33,64,271,304,314,317,347,356,394,422,469,476,538,558,57,76,188,220,246,269,276,316,447,470,483,486,519,4,31,85,98,185,200,213,362,513,520,521,565,576,602,620,39,46,65,89,119,175,227,249,294,329,331,385,393,395,420,489,494,580,619,627,22,30,84,121,138,164,198,277,311,339,564,574,617,11,14,18,75,82,92,100,135,152,192,236,238,413,421,428,466,472,529,557,575,621,93,197,202,211,234,241,245,273,423,426,453,458,459,460,471,504,548,550,584,28,56,111,153,156,196,244,357,412,439,485,518,103,108,109,195,215,322,338,340,378,427,443,490,593,15,32,66,118,124,182,203,235,256,257,287,292,367,382,383,431,441,474,475,488,511,586,587,607,618,635,123,145,151,155,186,201,231,346,348,386,392,410,414,438,517,530,588,603,67,74,120,150,163,165,247,266,293,330,368,487,559,608,637,107,117,141,148,162,337,375,425,477,501,566,609,634,232,255,303,384,416,429,444,522,531,562,585,258,332,335,381,34,158,242,243,274,366,567,611,7,52,166,169,290,350,463,514,552,596,606,59,106,181,342,532,261,284,288,349,409,547,556,563,582,53,73,78,216,289,396,433,63,507,515,534,49,62,142,168,183,379,457,535,561,623,636,104,260,280,325,336,380,398,451,502,560,577,8,16,60,262,278,291,308,321,364,589,604,605,77,96,134,305,352,528,579,597,622,17,90,173,333,371,417,456,516,594,79,94,97,122,139,167,251,351,365,91,437,442,136,149,180,512,601,259,334,353,424,628,105,549,306,397,505,508,2,61,154,326,573,578,624,189,323,5,128,281,307,533,295,302,403,539,50,301,369,372,399,448,455,546,1,35,553,320,83,592,545,312,318,319,591,590,583,638,3],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This switch controls the illumination of the vehicle's interior lights based on the status of the doors.\n\nWhen the doors are open, the lights turn on. When the doors are closed, the lights turn off. This provides a convenient way to turn the interior lights on and off without needing to manually operate the lights switch.\n\nThe door-linked interior light switch interacts with the vehicle's lighting system by sending signals to the control module based on the door status. The control module then activates or deactivates the appropriate interior light circuits.\n\nThis feature is designed to enhance safety and convenience for the vehicle's occupants. By automatically turning on the lights when the doors are open, it helps illuminate the interior space when entering or exiting the vehicle. Conversely, turning off the lights when the doors are closed helps conserve battery power and reduces glare for the driver.\n\nThe door-linked interior light switch is part of the vehicle's overall lighting system, which also includes front and rear personal lights, an illuminated entry system, and automatic illumination in case of airbag deployment or strong rear impacts. These features work together to provide optimal lighting and safety for the vehicle's occupants in various driving scenarios.","source":"data/test/grand_highlander_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[198,219,385,91,342,345,99,313,378,153,211,248,328,578,151,210,316,369,576,72,155,206,266,285,347,411,95,156,308,3,45,199,225,246,346,381,382,388,490,577,88,102,124,166,247,318,329,334,343,416,68,83,262,267,377,398,415,15,82,162,172,212,265,338,374,375,463,506,574,203,216,294,545,566,302,344,350,20,220,257,304,307,327,368,575,25,69,96,218,281,293,320,322,341,558,37,73,89,122,136,152,215,383,384,409,86,103,112,118,127,178,228,306,335,337,348,370,379,380,397,512,7,71,100,123,232,258,259,264,269,284,301,413,85,90,126,130,137,141,208,330,340,376,407,417,509,47,79,223,229,254,277,323,355,484,542,550,573,579,13,48,76,139,272,278,291,296,326,331,402,445,580,16,18,22,44,80,106,121,168,177,204,214,253,270,282,300,336,391,485,559,17,38,94,115,116,217,224,249,357,421,435,438,454,467,519,592,97,150,163,170,268,367,462,138,154,171,226,242,261,280,315,324,333,339,466,43,93,164,207,289,351,430,472,501,549,33,41,110,119,128,240,352,373,513,546,1,92,221,390,551,273,412,432,459,491,508,111,167,286,295,297,424,428,570,10,129,173,213,237,356,372,548,74,78,134,245,371,408,440,478,539,547,84,260,311,393,395,401,446,487,534,569,14,19,145,158,159,174,239,241,319,325,544,125,222,243,263,279,504,540,583,594,24,77,227,406,414,442,453,476,571,6,9,23,132,161,292,298,434,498,572,581,98,101,107,299,389,418,455,479,582,50,58,169,312,314,387,464,468,502,505,567,593,597,70,81,117,271,392,423,450,465,470,527,560,66,244,276,288,400,433,477,496,515,543,563,589,59,67,105,231,332,403,483,503,530,64,114,188,196,349,399,404,427,480,494,541,598,57,60,87,113,140,175,192,238,305,362,394,460,499,562,32,35,46,133,230,274,287,290,317,419,62,157,309,429,52,190,363,386,422,469,536,4,42,165,252,256,452,588,595,56,131,185,303,474,510,2,26,183,354,359,436,537,21,29,53,61,104,135,176,181,194,236,255,283,321,410,492,591,189,235,251,275,361,437,486,514,528,564,49,120,184,234,521,584,144,195,202,209,522,526,533,561,27,191,310,405,471,40,193,205,358,448,481,482,489,511,28,30,36,182,201,443,447,554,149,396,493,495,552,586,497,568,596,34,51,63,143,179,187,500,31,54,441,451,146,186,439,456,461,535,587,590,65,200,538,585,39,109,366,473,553,250,353,360,233,12,148,420,475,488,523,525,11,55,147,507,108,142,160,75,449,458,520,425,529,180,197,365,457,518,557,431,517,555,556,565,8,426,532,5,531,364,444,516,524],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

It is designed to prevent the engine from accelerating the vehicle when the brake pedal is depressed simultaneously with the accelerator pedal. This is intended to prevent sudden acceleration that could occur if the driver accidentally presses the accelerator while braking.\n\nWhen the Brake Override System is activated, it will cause the engine to reduce its output, essentially \"overriding\" the accelerator pedal's input. This can affect the driver's experience in several ways:\n\n1. The vehicle may feel less responsive or slower to accelerate when the brake pedal is pressed.\n\n2. The driver may notice a slight reduction in engine power, especially when trying to accelerate quickly.\n\n3.

The top vent is labeled \"A\" and the bottom vent is labeled \"B.\"\n\nThe positioning of these vents is crucial for proper oven function. The vents release hot air and moisture from the oven during cooking, which helps to maintain even temperature distribution and ensures that food cooks consistently. Proper air circulation prevents hot spots and cold areas within the oven, leading to better cooking results.\n\nThe vents also play a role in the self-cleaning process. During the self-clean cycle, the vents allow the hot air to circulate and heat the oven interior, which helps to break down and burn off food residue. This ensures that the oven is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.\n\nAdditionally, the vents help to cool the oven after use, preventing excessive heat buildup and making the oven safer to handle. By allowing hot air to escape, the vents also reduce the risk of condensation and moisture buildup inside the oven, which can cause mold growth and unpleasant odors.\n\nIn summary, the positioning of the oven vents at the top and bottom of the cavity ensures proper air circulation, temperature regulation, and efficient self-cleaning, all of which contribute to optimal cooking performance and oven longevity.","source":"data/test/ywge745c0fs.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[1,12,3,10,22,4,16,11,17,32,9,33,34,19,5,6,24,31,36,38,2,26,13,14,27,35,30,28,29,7,15,37,25,20,23,21,8,39,18,40],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

Cast iron heats slowly and evenly, which is ideal for achieving a good brown crust on foods like meats and vegetables.\n\nHowever, the table also notes that rough edges or burrs on cast iron cookware may scratch the cooktop. This is an important consideration when using cast iron on a ceramic glass cooktop, as the cooktop surface can be delicate and prone to scratches.\n\nTo avoid damaging the cooktop, it's important to use cast iron cookware with smooth edges and to handle it carefully when placing it on the cooktop. If rough edges are present, they should be filed or smoothed out before use to prevent scratching the cooktop.\n\nOverall, while cast iron is excellent for browning and frying, users should be mindful of the potential for scratching the cooktop surface, especially if the cookware has rough edges.

These systems are designed to detect obstacles and pedestrians, ensuring safe parking and reversing. When non-factory equipment is installed, it can obstruct the sensors' field of view, leading to reduced detection capabilities. This can result in the following consequences:\n\n1. **False Alarms**: The system may trigger unnecessary alerts, leading to driver confusion and potential accidents.\n2. **Missed Obstacles**: The sensors might fail to detect obstacles or pedestrians, increasing the risk of collisions.\n3. **System Malfunction**: The sensors might not function properly, leading to system failure or reduced effectiveness.\n4. **Inaccurate Distance Measurement**: The sensors might provide incorrect distance readings, affecting the vehicle's safe stopping distance.\n\nThese consequences directly relate to the vehicle's safety systems by compromising their intended functions. The driver assistance systems rely on accurate sensor data to provide warnings and assist in braking, which are crucial for preventing collisions. Therefore, installing non-factory equipment on the bumper can undermine the vehicle's safety features, potentially leading to serious accidents.","source":"data/test/elantra_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[399,405,404,329,400,388,401,324,69,323,425,360,58,395,74,66,406,11,2,454,62,73,415,158,394,473,215,403,51,68,256,450,49,47,463,36,307,423,32,60,216,292,165,341,402,421,164,171,475,499,41,148,220,418,37,48,55,59,124,166,281,306,434,435,490,30,46,72,203,210,274,286,291,460,525,24,42,150,212,229,426,476,498,25,57,64,94,130,224,238,330,44,50,70,122,136,275,295,296,308,311,337,359,464,45,145,204,225,276,358,376,494,52,87,90,149,211,257,268,285,433,500,533,123,172,180,190,213,226,248,288,309,34,162,188,200,214,218,265,300,387,417,458,491,17,22,71,121,144,170,191,273,289,326,375,396,436,451,452,462,483,511,528,61,266,310,383,410,411,445,492,19,21,28,129,154,159,160,246,294,313,318,327,370,495,519,127,168,250,348,379,397,427,453,457,477,63,140,182,209,249,258,267,389,422,456,474,29,35,56,65,86,115,132,152,242,290,325,449,455,478,510,527,38,40,117,189,223,230,235,260,269,409,461,493,14,27,43,67,88,118,119,176,178,251,272,279,316,424,468,529,531,79,89,141,146,192,196,245,262,298,322,398,413,447,479,480,487,497,517,10,39,103,113,126,128,264,328,333,372,391,459,508,92,202,217,231,343,344,386,412,429,465,467,31,83,84,85,120,142,147,197,233,247,287,354,357,385,441,442,472,496,95,106,131,153,193,232,236,252,293,320,366,470,489,513,524,530,4,5,53,91,100,175,183,244,319,342,384,390,407,514,526,532,26,151,169,199,207,208,222,227,254,350,378,485,15,93,101,102,125,143,219,228,259,261,304,305,314,317,321,336,349,419,420,484,486,16,54,104,108,234,302,347,393,446,448,471,18,23,156,184,194,201,221,253,431,167,206,299,356,367,392,438,482,97,110,163,240,243,271,297,96,107,133,155,174,181,186,237,284,301,335,353,355,374,381,481,488,506,112,187,241,263,369,371,377,432,439,82,111,303,338,340,345,368,408,430,437,444,501,509,3,33,78,139,185,364,416,469,20,81,98,99,138,312,352,373,512,507,1,239,362,6,134,135,177,179,346,363,380,77,255,283,515,13,198,523,173,277,365,518,8,105,332,339,351,12,80,116,270,282,414,428,502,522,205,7,361,443,520,76,382,503,75,137,466,157,195,331,516,114,315,334,504,278,9,161,521,280,109,440,505],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

These functions are crucial for enhancing the comfort and safety of the vehicle's seating system in several ways:\n\n1. **Seat Cushion Tilt (1)**: This adjustment allows the driver to change the angle of the front part of the seat cushion. By tilting the seat cushion, the driver can achieve a more ergonomic seating position, which can reduce back strain and improve overall posture. This is particularly important for long drives, as it helps maintain comfort and reduces the risk of fatigue-related accidents.\n\n2. **Seat Height (2)**: The seat height adjustment allows the driver to raise or lower the height of the seat. This is essential for accommodating drivers of different heights and ensuring that the seat is at the optimal position for visibility and control. Proper seat height is crucial for maintaining a safe and comfortable driving posture, which can help prevent accidents caused by poor visibility or discomfort.\n\nTogether, these adjustments contribute to the overall comfort and safety of the vehicle's seating system by allowing the driver to customize the seat to their specific needs, thereby reducing the risk of discomfort-related accidents and enhancing the overall driving experience.","source":"data/test/elantra_2024.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[28,16,156,194,27,70,111,183,97,172,17,32,185,205,155,218,176,217,196,142,161,193,204,23,153,346,352,345,34,36,42,114,175,200,38,234,240,267,332,529,168,187,198,210,56,160,189,216,206,497,158,186,54,159,197,525,120,150,181,348,367,164,354,74,118,61,119,208,221,531,24,68,188,211,230,258,40,173,266,315,530,102,149,174,201,202,209,271,310,477,527,64,190,227,269,284,356,378,52,77,95,106,115,152,224,236,250,5,35,60,62,199,212,215,456,58,75,347,92,184,353,366,369,414,533,30,39,117,170,178,225,425,57,123,157,165,229,243,350,381,104,128,144,151,154,177,195,342,372,382,415,454,482,78,331,377,419,485,33,113,171,220,392,473,475,65,90,141,237,304,351,421,453,528,26,66,139,148,244,302,344,349,355,484,22,72,91,112,130,256,450,476,478,481,495,50,124,146,163,213,226,299,334,363,373,479,67,88,99,259,336,362,364,408,480,98,126,138,182,203,223,238,254,328,374,458,489,19,89,147,162,169,262,474,513,14,18,49,73,76,80,265,321,368,384,85,101,145,192,228,314,361,435,41,82,233,290,300,301,324,340,397,432,455,48,143,166,207,231,251,295,296,322,426,8,125,179,235,263,357,365,387,444,498,25,63,71,127,136,140,264,286,305,359,386,393,401,524,59,69,83,103,287,303,312,316,326,335,391,406,410,459,532,15,100,110,252,261,289,306,380,396,411,436,447,55,84,122,134,247,255,285,318,333,338,339,390,465,483,94,129,222,241,248,358,385,420,429,449,457,512,13,44,107,260,272,288,398,409,413,441,509,31,46,180,246,388,389,400,29,87,135,330,431,488,191,242,275,294,308,319,412,51,132,214,253,276,327,343,405,422,446,79,283,291,298,320,416,486,47,292,311,323,394,445,494,506,526,105,376,448,500,86,121,133,281,313,370,427,510,11,219,239,245,249,417,430,21,43,45,137,325,375,379,399,460,503,131,257,383,404,451,496,37,297,402,418,491,499,167,232,279,307,317,452,487,507,93,360,439,2,20,53,268,309,341,403,442,463,490,293,329,407,423,7,81,270,278,424,468,492,519,10,108,443,511,517,4,508,109,514,371,395,469,471,493,433,472,274,337,461,3,96,273,462,470,280,434,501,515,277,437,464,520,440,438,1,505,523,6,504,12,116,282,428,502,516,522,467,466,521,518,9],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This allows for flexibility in how personalization is applied, depending on the user's recent activity with their digital key.","source":"data/test/elantra_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[138,137,381,139,154,253,120,135,133,104,151,152,270,145,276,256,529,169,177,106,230,231,94,131,146,150,178,238,353,93,132,134,167,200,227,127,128,229,242,264,101,143,189,226,234,332,51,115,130,174,382,124,126,250,35,153,225,136,155,141,175,212,17,215,269,142,173,176,235,252,377,123,246,265,373,378,84,140,159,207,232,412,97,261,305,348,208,290,125,158,241,530,105,149,221,240,222,351,103,107,111,147,194,315,398,108,206,228,320,409,438,102,209,287,392,165,179,217,247,254,346,92,112,168,244,266,352,372,148,483,36,86,193,338,214,218,339,384,408,118,144,166,497,122,129,172,195,289,27,170,527,90,183,249,288,89,251,258,364,387,456,26,41,184,198,255,397,40,185,190,205,237,300,156,187,213,236,327,355,109,201,204,347,421,471,12,80,116,121,163,262,282,334,369,428,502,522,77,257,277,333,356,396,431,484,525,23,171,199,272,322,6,95,216,243,271,374,452,469,470,524,53,188,259,400,435,181,263,301,324,420,448,30,507,29,85,117,314,506,508,61,302,343,386,425,460,233,297,349,42,52,74,410,416,488,60,79,196,328,526,186,202,210,260,331,367,39,78,476,32,65,157,161,197,318,459,517,518,533,62,223,362,371,458,88,180,248,267,299,354,473,516,16,66,160,211,390,391,514,25,164,303,308,312,313,330,443,487,7,83,220,245,316,358,414,455,464,493,119,275,335,340,376,523,24,68,329,366,528,67,298,317,363,415,422,444,461,73,203,239,411,468,69,279,286,321,344,385,427,454,485,58,75,99,326,365,380,28,44,50,224,350,401,463,474,110,368,379,383,489,43,274,293,307,341,360,413,429,465,467,472,498,38,98,182,295,323,345,419,423,426,477,509,21,57,278,281,310,375,407,439,457,478,486,45,87,319,357,361,462,512,11,37,96,114,192,342,531,4,8,34,72,82,273,311,500,5,64,81,268,306,495,503,31,63,191,370,430,441,492,496,499,284,292,490,519,47,59,91,113,162,389,450,466,475,480,13,33,359,393,433,451,482,494,510,511,388,395,417,520,532,15,285,55,446,521,10,291,296,309,394,405,491,14,18,48,76,283,406,424,219,403,437,442,505,449,481,3,9,399,434,440,445,447,2,54,71,280,1,49,56,304,432,325,404,453,46,294,504,20,336,337,513,418,22,19,436,501,515,402,479,70,100],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

Lane departure prevention systems are designed to help drivers maintain their lane by providing subtle steering input when the vehicle begins to drift out of its lane.

This is consistent with the description of the LDP function in the context, which mentions providing assistance through steering wheel operations to help avoid deviation from the lane or course.  The upward direction aligns with the typical behavior of a lane departure prevention system, which would attempt to correct the vehicle's path by steering it back towards the center of the lane.  The arrow's position relative to the vehicle's lane also supports this interpretation, as it shows the direction of the corrective steering input.\n","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[241,234,242,238,291,302,240,230,270,304,274,110,333,232,303,70,253,298,307,246,301,177,178,272,95,261,359,256,262,269,366,411,141,224,286,312,86,247,289,271,313,103,260,364,393,191,263,290,144,251,300,335,386,396,410,259,264,102,142,225,318,13,214,220,275,279,284,296,321,104,158,165,223,276,297,3,213,294,314,434,442,547,245,281,283,320,76,112,131,244,258,273,306,325,424,485,7,113,243,266,268,308,461,85,212,250,252,323,514,539,542,78,114,166,249,267,282,315,332,438,537,63,77,96,129,194,228,229,236,254,257,285,287,215,218,237,280,299,305,38,82,105,143,187,216,231,248,277,288,535,99,201,227,265,317,507,32,100,150,190,198,199,217,235,420,544,42,189,219,222,226,255,293,295,311,543,66,211,221,239,316,324,369,449,564,34,88,203,310,322,402,526,536,64,73,84,93,210,278,339,340,437,546,2,22,109,126,133,309,459,515,37,69,108,111,149,157,173,292,319,338,425,465,524,20,30,57,61,79,91,98,146,208,387,415,422,466,561,26,72,92,185,540,545,25,65,138,154,361,406,419,428,525,527,140,233,349,452,14,18,39,83,197,337,372,462,477,523,55,182,464,475,56,172,204,336,516,115,162,362,17,62,120,344,453,513,533,53,160,163,168,183,327,331,473,517,45,169,184,401,450,481,43,87,107,326,350,405,421,451,15,19,27,145,345,412,470,528,23,46,68,132,371,397,417,432,469,51,67,328,342,29,31,35,49,392,548,181,188,334,413,416,8,206,360,382,403,426,439,10,97,130,148,153,351,430,134,192,346,358,487,538,550,559,40,127,128,195,509,529,41,54,75,94,170,330,384,385,408,1,44,58,174,341,395,444,472,541,59,81,122,394,50,80,167,383,510,6,117,355,374,404,441,474,498,89,348,365,389,418,479,171,433,478,512,52,101,139,179,376,390,391,407,436,458,508,48,137,147,180,202,375,480,554,60,151,193,455,519,552,186,21,36,125,175,209,353,363,476,161,435,440,446,506,532,116,368,399,463,200,388,445,489,4,28,33,74,468,563,381,494,24,205,429,460,534,12,119,123,196,367,370,502,522,16,155,156,207,356,400,457,378,106,414,443,454,496,47,135,136,380,409,518,560,9,347,431,557,373,488,556,152,159,555,562,11,121,329,398,495,553,343,456,423,448,493,497,176,377,558,71,357,486,427,447,521,5,551,511,124,354,503,379,484,352,467,492,530,499,504,500,471,491,490,164,90,501,549,505,483,520,118,482,531],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1}]}

This way, the linked mirror function will continue to work as intended, automatically adjusting the mirror angle when shifting to R.","source":"data/test/camry_hybrid_2025.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[146,542,544,144,296,532,297,316,308,28,186,145,299,111,216,38,171,201,453,148,287,161,323,101,158,288,352,423,89,192,206,218,280,43,112,169,252,330,411,528,1,215,303,355,390,391,469,494,170,172,217,238,251,295,105,232,292,327,354,422,427,533,4,73,94,127,151,200,205,224,231,425,467,480,481,14,15,157,285,305,309,362,413,516,53,74,143,150,294,325,2,55,140,175,182,234,302,310,322,387,416,440,445,474,476,208,265,304,307,314,324,337,351,356,378,386,392,396,448,451,457,473,534,47,95,123,130,154,156,173,181,210,329,336,410,419,475,539,560,96,129,134,167,219,230,267,300,306,405,442,543,139,180,220,233,242,256,270,284,326,397,398,463,17,119,195,207,212,279,358,359,399,429,511,5,32,68,69,121,137,193,236,239,240,275,368,374,401,446,509,538,12,85,132,138,153,184,189,198,344,349,402,461,506,515,54,58,60,131,141,183,199,221,222,237,281,369,375,404,441,459,479,526,531,537,30,61,76,125,160,211,243,257,277,383,407,426,438,26,27,75,86,188,244,248,370,389,393,403,412,443,450,454,455,466,493,523,535,541,40,135,168,187,197,255,343,433,436,59,159,165,178,185,290,313,319,320,328,334,347,348,400,431,439,471,3,6,103,149,152,260,293,338,364,381,415,420,472,540,546,547,563,16,62,88,90,120,227,430,437,449,536,562,70,126,136,204,209,235,264,274,278,282,357,360,379,421,465,517,558,45,57,117,272,301,333,382,408,551,33,77,78,116,177,254,263,335,365,395,409,432,468,527,561,128,249,266,268,317,339,340,367,406,417,470,477,478,510,530,39,142,179,194,286,291,315,373,444,462,464,512,513,525,545,35,50,52,84,147,202,225,372,418,434,460,31,133,155,213,259,283,321,345,361,428,553,559,19,29,56,79,104,250,273,276,298,366,447,514,518,519,552,557,65,124,174,228,247,258,269,353,384,388,394,414,550,23,72,113,122,191,229,271,318,342,346,435,452,508,555,18,21,46,164,203,214,223,502,507,522,529,554,7,8,10,91,102,110,163,166,176,289,363,456,489,499,9,82,226,241,332,371,36,106,377,424,548,64,80,190,253,350,556,245,261,262,487,48,87,99,312,385,13,44,71,108,341,83,93,107,11,98,100,109,118,311,498,504,20,41,49,246,376,380,482,505,37,66,92,162,488,97,196,42,501,115,331,520,67,496,25,81,495,503,63,114,492,458,521,524,491,51,490,22,34,483,500,549,24,486,484,497,485,564],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"3","score":3},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

Firstly, the equipment may interfere with the OnStar system's operation, potentially rendering it non-functional. This could prevent the vehicle from communicating with emergency services, accessing roadside assistance, or utilizing other OnStar features. Secondly, the added equipment could drain the vehicle's 12-volt battery, even when the vehicle is not in use, leading to a discharged battery and possible engine failure. Thirdly, the equipment might not be compatible with the vehicle's electrical architecture, causing erratic vehicle operation or damage to the vehicle's electrical system. This could result in costly repairs and a potentially unsafe driving environment. Overall, adding electrical equipment without proper consideration can significantly impact the vehicle's functionality, user experience, and safety.

The juicer uses a spinning cone to press the fruit, and a longer time ensures that the maximum amount of juice is released.\n\n2. **Efficiency**: A longer processing time can help in efficiently extracting juice from the fruit, especially if the citrus is not very juicy or if the juicer is not very effective.\n\n3. **Consistency**: The extended time helps in achieving a more consistent juice yield, reducing the variability in juice extraction.\n\n4. **Thoroughness**: Longer juicing time ensures that the fruit is pressed uniformly, leading to a more even and complete extraction of juice.\n\n5. **Avoiding Overprocessing**: While longer times are recommended, it's important not to overprocess the fruit, which could lead to the release of bitter compounds or damage to the juicer.\n\n6. **Safety**: Overprocessing can also lead to the release of harmful substances, so the recommended time range provides a balance between thorough extraction and safety.\n\nBy following this recommended time range, users can ensure that they get the best possible juice yield from their citrus fruits using the food processor's citrus juicer attachment.","source":"data/test/multipro_onetouch_fdm73.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[27,5,37,3,31,24,35,19,20,56,22,26,28,29,4,30,21,34,14,11,15,36,38,76,41,7,17,57,1,16,33,9,13,23,67,69,6,8,46,62,32,51,58,53,48,54,10,12,25,71,63,65,60,55,40,61,39,50,47,73,75,18,52,45,49,77,44,59,79,68,78,74,43,81,66,42,80,72,64,70,82,2],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"What is the relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of the lens described in the document, and how does this relationship affect the depth of field and exposure in photography?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[410],"raw_output":"","pred":"The relationship between the focal length and the maximum aperture of the lens described in the document is inversely proportional. As the focal length increases, the maximum aperture decreases. Specifically, the maximum aperture for the 18 mm focal length is f/3.5, while for the 140 mm focal length, it is f/5.6. This relationship affects the depth of field and exposure in photography in several ways:\n\n1. **Depth of Field**: A longer focal length (140 mm) results in a shallower depth of field compared to a shorter focal length (18 mm). This means that with a 140 mm lens, the subject will be in sharp focus, while the foreground and background will be more blurred. Conversely, a shorter focal length (18 mm) will provide a deeper depth of field, keeping both the subject and a larger portion of the scene in sharp focus.\n\n2. **Exposure**: The maximum aperture also affects exposure. A larger aperture (f/3.5) allows more light to enter the lens, which is beneficial in low-light conditions or when a faster shutter speed is needed to avoid motion blur. A smaller aperture (f/5.6) allows less light to enter, which can be useful for controlling the depth of field or when using a tripod to avoid camera shake.\n\nIn summary, the inverse relationship between focal length and maximum aperture allows photographers to control the depth of field and adjust exposure according to their needs, whether they are capturing landscapes, portraits, or action shots.","source":"data/test/d5600.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[400,405,410,379,292,340,220,148,75,218,332,264,338,402,401,412,418,122,395,383,336,257,334,406,382,165,259,179,276,294,146,144,331,43,147,151,190,149,150,367,370,414,333,145,143,112,419,8,86,118,377,47,131,7,102,110,120,180,282,129,261,345,346,375,384,385,44,119,403,31,106,154,293,78,85,121,33,113,142,254,265,280,371,420,76,116,132,152,155,81,114,156,11,28,37,58,67,98,398,32,157,387,407,408,199,56,79,90,105,108,153,192,260,263,99,178,341,5,342,348,364,46,168,397,36,45,123,256,275,74,80,109,159,250,277,318,368,396,415,94,96,197,201,16,196,314,344,347,361,378,404,416,38,111,267,337,343,411,103,194,200,335,366,409,115,140,160,211,93,95,130,284,315,399,73,101,135,138,198,417,421,39,48,104,133,245,274,386,57,164,177,273,339,413,423,117,127,258,369,422,50,53,210,317,322,359,128,163,176,187,281,296,312,3,193,195,14,35,82,107,205,306,89,252,319,321,91,217,223,262,272,358,17,92,97,136,158,191,212,249,268,354,77,87,181,204,214,222,290,303,308,309,29,241,255,13,41,124,137,184,186,216,219,248,307,311,313,365,9,172,173,269,30,84,166,167,185,251,253,278,286,125,202,372,6,10,12,62,63,134,139,175,236,362,169,215,230,232,323,324,27,49,141,213,72,203,231,234,289,391,240,171,209,228,287,360,388,126,162,183,208,226,229,247,320,349,363,100,170,174,207,246,283,291,351,23,64,88,161,224,242,244,295,305,356,357,2,34,54,83,225,310,353,373,298,424,21,270,235,59,239,52,206,266,376,389,24,61,352,271,325,279,380,300,182,25,299,238,393,20,55,68,71,288,390,22,1,65,233,237,392,70,316,69,304,227,302,355,51,66,330,381,328,350,4,301,42,40,221,243,297,15,189,19,60,374,327,394,18,326,285,26,329,188],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"How does the camera's behavior regarding flash compensation differ when using the \"h\" mode compared to other modes?","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[160],"raw_output":"","pred":"The camera's behavior regarding flash compensation differs significantly when using the \"h\" mode compared to other modes. In \"h\" mode, the camera automatically adjusts the flash compensation value based on the scene's brightness. This is in contrast to other modes, where the flash compensation value is typically set manually by the user. The automatic adjustment in \"h\" mode ensures that the flash output is optimized for the specific lighting conditions, which can be particularly useful in challenging environments such as low light or high contrast scenes.

If they are not, repeat the height adjustment process.\n\n5. **Store Lighter Items**: If the doors remain aligned, store lighter items in the right-side door bins to maintain the door's weight and prevent future sagging.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the height lever continues to function effectively and that the doors remain properly aligned.","source":"data/test/rf59c7_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[46,47,142,143,48,240,144,333,45,242,39,134,332,72,141,265,33,139,12,16,56,181,241,335,38,151,152,21,62,135,18,271,334,77,232,237,15,64,122,343,71,132,168,103,116,145,199,133,364,11,32,110,9,17,173,175,213,233,23,164,166,170,174,234,239,249,272,336,42,128,148,273,114,118,188,214,274,24,65,102,162,180,22,112,137,358,371,372,5,158,163,178,202,221,243,317,337,19,36,43,105,109,216,230,235,263,275,279,325,342,366,49,51,100,111,117,127,177,182,250,294,351,359,20,147,167,193,225,357,55,84,146,267,278,286,323,328,331,347,367,31,78,85,136,155,157,169,226,269,298,307,308,345,348,352,73,97,215,227,261,297,313,353,40,41,82,98,107,156,160,244,255,256,268,280,339,370,30,37,126,176,208,245,14,26,34,104,161,171,246,254,262,277,338,61,121,198,203,251,318,330,354,360,368,69,88,113,165,192,196,211,289,299,302,362,369,108,172,231,292,295,314,326,10,94,106,123,209,224,238,258,281,301,303,375,52,80,129,140,149,154,207,260,329,346,25,75,86,101,125,130,153,190,210,236,264,296,320,365,44,79,184,248,276,356,74,150,197,247,300,312,319,324,7,8,13,50,53,60,67,115,200,201,218,361,179,259,266,340,344,349,355,59,66,219,220,288,304,305,321,120,159,194,350,363,68,119,222,252,293,311,138,257,57,63,76,131,204,206,223,282,341,373,309,327,4,70,96,217,315,380,310,87,95,183,253,306,316,54,99,212,2,3,205,287,83,270,290,58,81,93,228,284,379,6,229,27,291,191,91,124,195,374,378,90,285,377,29,1,186,322,92,187,28,189,35,376,89,185,283],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

{"question":"Explain how using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator can help minimize energy consumption, ensuring to reference the underlying physics.","answer":"","category":"texts","evidence_pages":[9],"raw_output":"","pred":"Using frozen food to thaw in your refrigerator minimizes energy consumption by leveraging the latent heat of fusion.  When frozen food is placed in the refrigerator, it absorbs heat from the surrounding air, causing the ice to melt.  This process requires energy, but it's a much smaller amount than the energy needed to cool the food from room temperature to its original frozen state.  Essentially, the refrigerator is doing less work because it's using the food itself to generate the necessary cooling effect.\n\nThis method also reduces the time the refrigerator door is open, which is a significant energy drain.  By allowing the food to thaw naturally, you minimize the number of times you need to open the door to add or remove food, thereby conserving energy.  Additionally, it prevents the sudden influx of warm air into the refrigerator, which would otherwise require the appliance to work harder to maintain the desired temperature.\n","source":"data/test/rf59c7_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[9,26,20,55,102,294,181,372,151,347,85,340,156,313,21,103,342,5,182,279,60,122,199,157,198,221,295,371,278,64,66,86,87,116,118,183,280,307,319,115,213,351,360,149,256,290,303,180,249,306,309,194,171,302,373,308,113,146,158,262,339,100,108,128,168,220,314,61,209,311,323,335,350,374,10,79,117,120,144,152,169,226,247,301,353,18,32,98,119,244,268,281,288,349,369,77,84,111,174,193,364,132,214,254,269,289,7,163,190,338,343,53,105,179,16,24,62,73,106,110,112,164,195,277,298,23,52,178,261,282,304,354,368,121,173,175,205,215,259,1,292,310,348,114,137,230,291,19,78,172,208,266,274,296,67,93,324,97,142,267,286,346,359,81,109,123,250,6,82,207,216,276,358,17,22,25,94,125,147,155,161,162,176,299,4,68,101,154,203,219,240,293,297,355,189,202,258,328,332,366,96,223,271,327,367,253,265,285,56,104,196,317,8,107,136,148,160,234,242,83,88,184,197,365,11,14,15,80,210,237,352,300,312,75,170,201,245,275,363,177,257,273,12,59,153,167,200,333,375,99,159,217,218,263,362,235,305,357,63,134,231,255,272,13,57,133,330,370,336,337,246,58,143,270,356,141,252,260,264,316,29,46,145,211,212,251,206,320,334,2,48,72,232,248,331,344,41,222,239,37,65,225,315,50,241,38,51,76,129,139,227,228,318,47,165,40,166,345,192,45,243,321,127,204,74,150,233,36,71,30,329,28,126,130,361,33,43,34,49,325,224,31,238,229,124,138,341,27,326,69,188,380,236,140,191,70,42,284,287,95,135,39,54,3,44,35,376,92,131,322,89,283,185,90,377,91,379,187,378,186],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This button is typically used to activate and deactivate cruise control in modern vehicles. Cruise control allows the driver to set a desired speed and maintain it without constantly pressing the accelerator pedal. When activated, the vehicle will automatically adjust its speed to stay within a set range of the target speed, which can be helpful for long-distance driving on highways or freeways. The driver can then focus on steering and other driving tasks without having to constantly adjust the throttle. Cruise control can also help improve fuel efficiency by reducing the frequency of acceleration and deceleration. Additionally, some vehicles may have a button or switch to manually control the cruise control system, allowing the driver to override the set speed or cancel cruise control altogether.","source":"data/test/zdx_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[182,120,36,168,171,13,83,220,5,84,187,151,226,124,201,239,175,19,21,276,221,241,85,178,207,243,275,35,190,112,41,209,52,119,184,198,267,11,79,240,10,28,34,135,199,272,18,121,15,31,53,160,301,131,340,123,29,134,136,197,347,82,203,139,271,342,154,158,211,236,242,26,80,90,200,213,235,51,269,37,98,114,148,161,164,248,295,6,49,224,225,254,286,289,142,206,260,268,188,296,228,229,231,234,48,223,261,262,70,92,100,144,157,191,343,344,8,47,54,60,159,181,202,288,25,86,117,172,258,16,55,179,204,263,4,7,43,45,149,156,205,246,270,345,346,173,192,218,300,329,338,341,30,94,106,111,113,127,150,185,303,305,17,81,118,126,180,12,20,42,58,152,153,163,195,214,14,24,46,75,107,141,186,210,215,216,73,130,193,249,339,22,88,101,169,174,177,208,217,230,247,299,302,2,56,78,91,162,194,266,277,283,313,40,76,77,87,104,122,133,227,232,237,255,290,298,311,335,44,59,63,102,115,167,238,257,324,9,39,50,57,64,65,72,170,176,189,280,297,334,32,66,110,145,183,233,3,61,62,71,97,125,222,252,259,284,306,315,325,27,96,103,109,264,273,316,319,74,95,105,292,310,108,155,196,219,287,293,304,312,328,33,93,143,212,265,278,330,253,279,291,309,322,331,38,146,165,294,307,67,132,138,89,129,244,333,250,274,314,326,332,308,336,128,337,147,320,69,317,321,99,245,116,140,282,137,281,285,323,1,327,318,349,166,256,23,251,68,348],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"2","score":2},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 2","score":2}]}

This means the module operates within the unlicensed ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band, which is typically used for devices like wireless routers, access points, and other low-power wireless communication devices.\n\nThe frequency range and output power are crucial for regulatory compliance. The 2412-2462 MHz band is designated for unlicensed use, allowing for widespread deployment without the need for a license. The output power limit of < 30 dBm ensures that the device does not generate excessive electromagnetic radiation, which could potentially interfere with other nearby devices or services.\n\nHowever, while the specified frequency range and output power are within the allowed limits, it's important to note that wireless devices can still cause interference if not properly configured or if they are placed too close to other devices operating in the same frequency band. This is particularly relevant in environments with dense wireless device usage, such as offices or residential areas.\n\nTo mitigate potential interference, users should ensure that the wireless LAN module is properly configured and that it operates in a frequency band that minimizes overlap with other devices.

This direct contact allows for efficient heat transfer from the processor to the heat sink.\n\nThe heat sink is designed to have multiple fins, which increase its surface area. This increased surface area enhances heat dissipation by allowing more air to flow over the fins, promoting convection and cooling. The fins are typically made of materials like aluminum or copper, which are excellent thermal conductors.\n\nThe heat sink is often attached to the processor using thermal paste or paste-like compounds. These materials help in transferring heat from the processor to the heat sink more effectively. The heat sink may also be connected to a heatsink fan, which helps in circulating air and further enhancing the cooling process.\n\nOverall, the heat sink's placement and design are integral to maintaining the device's thermal balance, ensuring that the processor operates within safe temperature limits and preventing potential overheating issues.","source":"data/test/inspiron_16_plus_7630.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[65,66,12,73,9,35,76,11,44,58,75,10,38,67,68,83,61,69,49,79,13,55,63,70,34,48,51,52,42,50,78,82,43,46,41,7,39,45,54,72,15,77,29,71,80,81,84,47,8,62,3,59,22,27,32,64,95,56,94,23,60,2,33,30,57,53,74,40,31,4,16,36,100,1,25,87,17,24,99,21,37,26,96,5,97,101,88,90,98,14,89,18,86,91,92,28,20,19,85,93,6],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"1","score":1},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 1","score":1},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 1\n","score":1}]}

These failures cause an immediate and complete loss of device functionality. An example of a catastrophic failure is a memory DIMM that receives a static shock and immediately generates a \"No POST/No Video\" symptom with a beep code emitted for missing or nonfunctional memory. This type of damage is more easily recognizable and can be immediately identified by the user.\n\nIntermittent failures, which represent approximately 80% of ESD-related failures, are more difficult to recognize and troubleshoot. These failures occur when the device receives a static shock, but the damage is not immediately visible. The weakened trace may take weeks or months to melt, and in the meantime, it can cause degradation of memory integrity, intermittent memory errors, and other issues. Intermittent failures are more challenging to diagnose because the symptoms are not immediately apparent, making it harder for users to identify the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn summary, catastrophic failures are more easily recognizable and cause immediate device failure, while intermittent failures are harder to diagnose and can lead to long-term degradation of device performance.","source":"data/test/inspiron_16_plus_7630.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[32,31,33,94,29,96,2,3,95,30,98,53,101,26,7,8,97,99,20,90,16,12,5,6,100,23,36,87,19,22,91,27,88,86,92,93,89,24,25,72,1,76,85,43,9,14,28,80,10,13,73,21,60,37,70,77,11,50,18,41,39,17,38,78,15,79,66,82,83,59,71,44,4,34,65,49,75,55,61,62,64,74,52,68,35,54,67,42,46,48,40,84,47,45,57,51,56,58,69,63,81],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

ESD can cause subtle damage to the internal components of the drive, such as the microcircuits and sensitive electronic components. This damage might not be immediately apparent, but it can lead to degradation over time.\n\nThe internal layers of the drive are vulnerable to ESD, which can alter device parameters or melt silicon junctions. While the drive may work perfectly for a while, the damage can reduce its life expectancy. The drive might continue to function for some time, but its performance could gradually decline, leading to issues such as slower read/write speeds, data corruption, or even complete failure.\n\nAdditionally, ESD can cause the drive to become more susceptible to further damage from other sources, such as temperature extremes or mechanical stress. This increased vulnerability can lead to premature failure of the drive, requiring replacement sooner than expected.\n\nIn summary, while ESD might not immediately affect the drive's functionality, it can cause long-term degradation and reduce the drive's overall lifespan, potentially leading to unexpected failures and increased maintenance costs.","source":"data/test/spectre_x360.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[30,33,91,34,4,35,31,85,75,40,83,36,3,20,77,29,54,57,38,76,82,11,92,12,32,59,56,19,27,41,74,23,5,48,67,78,2,14,15,47,64,80,81,88,79,63,39,37,61,93,13,60,68,66,84,18,49,86,45,53,55,65,6,58,24,71,87,50,62,70,51,42,73,16,8,90,69,9,46,43,26,17,22,21,52,1,44,25,72,7,10,28,89],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5 - Fully Correct","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

For example, a user who frequently uses the touchpad for tasks like scrolling or navigating could benefit from a more sensitive touchpad for increased speed and responsiveness. Conversely, a user who prefers a more precise touchpad might prefer a less sensitive setting. Overall, the ability to adjust touchpad sensitivity allows users to tailor their device's interaction to their specific needs and preferences.","source":"data/test/nitro_v_15.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[25,3,11,79,12,22,80,23,20,24,4,84,21,83,14,51,19,30,52,96,7,75,10,68,74,76,45,26,54,61,6,46,66,73,78,93,34,39,43,60,89,59,86,8,47,65,27,38,44,33,62,88,95,5,29,92,1,28,50,64,15,18,37,56,90,16,58,63,71,81,85,53,87,91,17,57,9,35,42,49,69,70,94,40,48,2,13,31,67,77,36,41,32,55,72,82],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

This port is specifically designed to receive the internet connection from the service provider.\n\nIt is important to use a specific type of cable for this connection because the Internet Port is a Gigabit (10/100/1000) port. This means it supports high-speed data transfer rates, which are essential for modern broadband connections. Using a CAT5e or higher rated cable ensures that the connection can handle the high-speed data transfer rates required for Gigabit connections. Lower-rated cables may not be able to support the full bandwidth of the Gigabit port, potentially leading to slower internet speeds or data transfer issues. Therefore, using the correct cable type is crucial for optimal performance and reliability of the internet connection.","source":"data/test/maxstream_mr5500_series.json","annotator":"azure","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[4,297,623,330,526,200,590,785,558,70,397,102,316,364,152,752,687,134,609,719,332,494,416,462,771,817,6,803,120,166,283,36,265,315,430,360,578,21,22,233,349,151,186,326,576,640,655,738,202,219,588,830,32,218,643,770,2,24,56,119,382,399,415,705,350,251,348,611,625,641,88,309,343,383,448,512,560,608,635,49,215,285,482,570,667,673,837,18,114,146,185,314,410,511,544,603,621,651,802,213,277,426,506,575,179,376,414,480,699,754,787,122,216,546,637,295,592,732,16,82,164,198,299,543,556,606,765,773,810,836,130,154,362,622,672,31,90,98,217,221,245,261,737,805,104,229,447,557,585,619,718,72,159,193,253,395,425,781,797,235,366,378,413,442,464,474,522,528,704,847,117,136,150,161,345,390,493,521,638,25,55,65,101,293,303,323,357,396,436,538,572,707,740,20,63,85,228,312,392,412,418,496,573,644,648,683,702,835,29,69,195,207,232,292,296,307,346,479,508,583,607,618,629,661,686,144,169,226,352,429,461,514,525,714,812,87,250,509,616,639,685,745,783,108,116,129,142,165,267,282,305,318,337,353,372,393,404,468,510,586,631,767,10,148,194,209,325,329,359,450,489,597,650,657,680,799,826,846,54,97,110,184,258,370,423,455,551,564,574,605,659,695,712,791,839,844,12,127,203,290,301,306,334,338,341,385,406,554,599,693,721,728,759,780,832,76,78,84,149,271,363,470,500,519,568,633,748,793,3,43,140,162,260,273,381,400,487,593,682,726,735,778,820,828,7,8,44,181,239,407,439,457,542,566,589,689,132,211,304,311,333,339,340,374,502,532,553,612,761,819,19,45,95,138,168,173,212,214,222,408,440,565,569,627,675,730,747,816,824,66,105,160,196,328,419,438,504,540,567,626,663,14,210,279,600,602,658,669,696,763,769,794,845,15,100,128,133,143,174,177,199,241,319,534,594,632,634,671,731,750,800,821,825,64,79,118,176,243,249,274,275,373,664,697,703,784,801,813,13,30,40,80,112,188,281,300,342,405,471,472,476,491,498,520,524,530,536,537,601,653,665,795,833,37,46,58,204,242,259,371,380,503,505,555,598,729,749,768,33,38,47,77,175,409,424,488,562,617,762,779,788,35,81,99,111,238,272,313,347,368,375,391,515,523,535,563,649,654,666,723,736,751,811,827,1,34,51,145,231,269,276,298,324,358,463,490,628,698,734,764,789,806,829,11,68,96,170,208,237,308,401,444,446,478,584,604,620,624,630,668,701,715,786,796,818,9,53,107,135,139,183,227,240,263,264,291,302,427,437,445,499,501,596,660,681,694,755,774,39,71,74,172,247,336,403,431,434,441,467,591,662,691,823,5,103,109,206,310,344,394,435,456,533,552,559,579,692,708,756,760,792,42,106,131,230,270,278,369,377,398,466,492,495,531,587,713,727,733,753,758,790,75,83,123,178,189,201,365,411,469,497,541,636,688,725,746,86,155,331,507,656,717,720,831,834,67,91,141,167,234,428,458,477,571,798,17,48,115,137,180,197,244,294,361,432,443,473,527,652,684,26,73,113,266,286,386,465,529,782,815,840,57,254,539,716,848,28,236,356,647,711,147,163,192,225,389,475,690,700,741,94,322,433,483,809,50,126,246,547,550,582,59,367,384,422,459,615,822,841,843,62,351,451,486,518,676,679,153,220,268,317,327,417,454,460,677,744,772,777,814,838,52,156,158,280,513,766,807,187,257,262,289,379,561,580,610,613,722,121,124,182,248,255,577,674,354,545,642,23,320,420,484,287,89,284,548,645,92,223,775,670,709,60,252,321,742,481,516,776,449,452,706,804,335,739,842,205,387,41,190,421,157,388,517,355,402,453,61,614,549,581,125,743,27,191,646,224,288,808,171,710,595,678,93,256,485,757,724],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

This could be due to the child node being too far from the parent node, or the parent node being too far from the modem.\n","source":"data/test/maxstream_mr5500_series.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[3,525,101,329,4,396,69,133,686,557,199,493,296,429,622,718,165,589,494,784,6,166,751,102,397,35,200,785,816,264,558,654,687,232,297,330,363,399,526,655,19,70,134,625,364,461,590,623,817,430,719,233,202,830,332,462,178,376,699,752,375,611,797,175,505,787,122,496,592,634,168,285,366,425,732,24,36,104,114,277,362,569,145,146,179,213,352,506,570,578,665,693,698,731,154,265,343,514,575,667,773,45,49,81,309,418,560,663,805,138,318,410,442,510,538,643,666,669,707,754,815,829,31,38,48,82,86,144,221,250,409,441,546,585,603,635,695,728,765,15,150,307,374,382,564,740,118,140,212,229,253,342,385,446,450,528,537,703,730,826,828,16,34,72,136,185,188,207,209,215,228,276,299,328,337,415,426,474,573,574,602,650,675,21,47,66,80,90,110,113,142,162,180,193,241,243,245,258,341,372,381,447,556,568,587,599,619,633,639,640,697,737,764,836,58,132,151,177,211,305,308,310,370,404,414,440,482,504,551,621,637,712,821,834,14,169,244,275,323,390,406,438,455,541,566,597,657,704,748,793,32,78,112,117,198,222,249,315,395,412,436,468,519,534,536,542,601,661,689,702,726,761,763,778,780,781,798,839,40,63,87,108,129,271,290,325,378,413,428,472,473,508,579,608,618,631,653,721,723,795,799,812,844,44,50,76,84,100,115,116,149,164,174,183,218,273,282,295,316,326,339,346,357,408,432,454,479,500,511,518,530,545,554,583,607,670,713,759,791,796,801,12,55,127,194,196,226,239,380,521,532,572,594,605,627,630,647,680,701,756,769,792,802,65,106,197,349,356,360,401,487,553,562,615,711,835,840,10,95,130,173,231,269,359,394,423,470,498,524,629,671,673,733,738,768,770,803,810,818,824,825,833,18,53,94,119,159,170,182,217,237,257,267,303,311,389,405,416,427,448,486,502,543,586,588,616,644,648,662,668,745,783,806,843,43,52,64,68,126,204,279,301,322,368,422,434,437,522,604,609,612,638,683,691,692,766,767,779,11,54,109,128,148,225,281,293,333,334,345,347,348,383,433,444,466,509,512,544,582,593,659,672,694,708,714,744,755,777,819,838,57,74,88,96,98,131,184,186,216,230,259,263,286,313,445,457,492,539,540,563,567,576,624,628,800,813,2,28,75,141,208,214,219,235,247,291,294,319,338,351,377,393,403,477,501,515,531,550,561,571,584,596,598,606,620,679,715,725,771,772,831,846,847,9,62,77,107,158,161,192,195,203,234,238,246,302,304,384,391,439,443,449,458,471,478,547,736,750,758,774,804,832,8,29,56,85,120,143,152,206,251,353,369,371,386,411,435,476,499,565,682,746,789,809,823,22,23,30,91,105,139,172,181,189,190,242,272,278,283,336,392,467,480,481,488,503,513,520,533,591,617,636,651,700,722,837,845,1,42,60,71,163,167,236,261,270,312,344,350,365,400,456,460,464,469,475,549,555,559,641,649,688,705,747,782,790,811,46,83,210,240,248,260,280,407,452,507,527,535,660,674,696,717,727,5,7,25,89,99,121,135,274,284,300,331,340,358,431,451,453,483,495,523,642,685,720,734,739,741,753,760,762,788,17,20,79,103,124,147,153,156,201,220,223,227,255,266,287,306,317,321,354,398,419,490,491,580,610,626,632,656,706,710,729,735,749,39,92,97,111,155,289,292,298,379,387,420,424,484,517,552,577,613,645,684,786,794,820,841,37,51,93,123,125,137,176,252,373,388,497,516,529,600,775,807,59,73,314,324,463,548,614,676,742,367,716,827,485,658,677,743,417,465,664,709,13,26,160,187,320,327,157,262,489,33,254,256,581,646,776,678,355,690,67,224,288,268,681,421,814,842,361,41,808,61,191,757,27,459,652,171,848,335,205,724,595,402,822],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 4","score":4},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
{"question":"Here's a challenging test question based on the target tables in the document:\n\nWhat key piece of information would differentiate between a cloud login and a local login when reporting issues to Linksys, and how might this impact user privacy considerations?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[20],"raw_output":"","pred":"The key piece of information that would differentiate between a cloud login and a local login when reporting issues to Linksys is the \"Login Type\" field. This field displays either \"cloud\" or \"local\" depending on the login method used.\n\nThis differentiation is important for user privacy considerations. When a user logs in using the cloud method, their associated email address is displayed. This could potentially reveal more personal information about the user, such as their email address and potentially their identity, depending on how the email address is linked to the account.\n\nIn contrast, when a user logs in using the local method, the login type displays \"Router admin\". This provides less personal information about the user, as it does not reveal their email address or any other identifying details.\n\nThis distinction allows Linksys to offer different levels of privacy to users based on their login method. Users who prefer more privacy can choose the local login option, while those who are willing to share more information can use the cloud login. This flexibility allows Linksys to balance the need for accurate issue reporting with user privacy concerns.","source":"data/test/maxstream_mr5500_series.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[118,20,150,561,7,446,542,755,658,39,217,529,690,414,236,400,574,639,703,769,497,736,86,249,333,593,626,105,268,465,510,607,722,137,367,169,300,750,801,234,295,380,322,347,671,257,433,73,820,40,158,559,744,94,159,231,401,463,720,788,34,62,170,203,266,362,466,562,679,789,37,63,204,478,656,753,786,2,100,167,198,328,454,518,756,834,74,495,591,647,711,809,818,53,103,527,680,723,843,5,138,334,356,556,821,183,298,313,365,594,659,685,689,777,71,201,431,582,783,28,126,289,398,434,486,530,550,621,691,323,528,688,712,815,68,135,136,264,269,301,368,487,492,498,551,615,124,164,225,389,422,524,548,624,653,683,754,6,72,95,132,281,290,366,627,192,237,588,592,193,196,226,258,331,361,29,66,190,296,393,420,423,460,560,847,8,299,360,399,519,583,717,745,106,586,645,657,709,775,778,26,54,60,127,396,484,496,613,648,718,781,787,841,38,232,263,287,452,522,625,721,844,92,101,395,516,677,742,162,165,294,326,363,387,429,458,490,748,390,464,715,104,202,320,348,428,525,580,616,619,156,229,555,622,651,784,69,267,461,807,813,133,332,354,98,197,455,493,557,686,810,848,32,168,223,293,357,394,554,261,589,716,835,130,319,654,235,255,426,751,819,587,816,262,327,381,427,612,35,131,199,239,620,184,491,523,564,693,749,782,1,67,99,352,43,432,444,684,33,485,629,155,314,353,579,799,3,57,108,271,459,532,10,329,110,189,337,378,436,483,652,692,84,147,154,172,230,303,566,708,78,163,418,419,467,470,572,757,791,45,125,238,270,351,438,508,531,578,605,663,761,793,51,59,76,123,140,316,370,385,534,547,644,669,759,814,823,840,222,273,388,392,646,725,726,758,773,806,824,838,254,317,468,500,540,549,565,596,661,767,776,826,845,102,286,321,369,384,404,412,643,779,839,122,144,148,206,386,513,539,546,597,700,774,790,832,27,42,50,139,141,157,160,173,207,247,284,288,318,371,449,451,481,514,604,675,676,695,741,805,812,55,61,83,91,116,151,215,279,311,345,411,437,499,628,660,678,733,734,760,792,24,121,153,191,224,256,336,435,515,533,563,571,581,637,673,797,25,44,58,75,90,109,134,146,171,209,272,278,382,403,453,502,512,538,694,732,739,842,107,128,302,391,405,476,558,590,611,642,662,668,701,710,727,743,808,36,64,93,181,187,339,374,526,576,614,707,728,798,9,41,77,81,89,114,241,277,350,469,517,545,610,740,18,23,82,88,142,174,220,240,285,376,482,501,506,599,674,706,765,766,188,260,355,417,430,471,584,598,630,702,713,735,804,831,96,115,175,221,280,342,344,375,489,507,544,567,603,698,719,764,796,245,274,306,308,358,372,441,443,450,474,505,509,569,575,649,699,811,830,11,213,292,377,410,421,439,448,462,473,480,541,577,606,609,665,737,772,15,46,56,79,117,194,252,297,304,309,338,364,373,424,442,475,552,573,636,641,650,697,731,752,802,825,145,182,246,253,259,265,305,310,330,608,617,667,746,800,827,16,30,70,87,166,216,251,315,343,406,409,520,666,687,705,724,829,12,14,208,244,307,397,402,494,504,535,536,631,681,696,833,17,178,214,312,340,415,457,472,570,623,664,785,795,19,48,113,143,179,186,195,200,210,212,227,233,291,341,379,383,407,456,633,638,655,729,768,817,837,31,129,152,479,488,511,601,634,672,771,22,47,49,120,211,275,568,595,618,635,738,763,803,828,52,80,185,250,276,324,346,585,704,730,747,762,794,846,4,112,177,180,219,242,243,325,335,440,503,537,553,600,780,111,119,149,283,447,477,602,836,65,85,161,176,408,416,543,13,21,97,248,282,359,632,228,413,521,640,670,682,349,218,425,770,822,445,714,205],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"How can adjusting the position of your phone during a call improve your experience while using hearing aids?","answer":"","category":"figures or diagrams or charts","evidence_pages":[193],"raw_output":"","pred":"Adjusting the position of your phone during a call can significantly improve your experience while using hearing aids. Hearing aids are designed to amplify sound, but they can also pick up ambient noise and feedback, which can interfere with the clarity of the call. By rotating or moving the phone, you can optimize the angle at which the hearing aid picks up the sound from the phone. This can reduce the amount of ambient noise and feedback that reaches the hearing aid, making the conversation clearer and more enjoyable.\n\nFor example, if you are holding the phone in a way that directs the sound directly towards the hearing aid, you might experience more feedback or less clarity. By adjusting the position, you can find a sweet spot where the sound from the phone is directed more efficiently towards the hearing aid, while minimizing the pickup of surrounding noise. This adjustment can be particularly beneficial if you are in a noisy environment or if the phone is not positioned optimally for sound transmission.\n\nAdditionally, using a phone stand or placing the phone on a flat surface can also help in maintaining a consistent and optimal position for the hearing aid to pick up the sound. This can lead to a more comfortable and effective use of your hearing aids during calls.","source":"data/test/moto_g24.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[193,239,102,38,156,194,240,245,103,5,107,100,160,159,23,65,101,6,19,129,162,45,175,230,238,40,118,242,105,106,147,163,196,228,164,24,26,61,237,4,192,21,140,176,113,58,117,151,219,232,115,9,82,166,47,50,81,104,190,203,7,95,150,191,254,13,46,186,56,227,236,55,63,90,174,226,41,78,108,205,29,51,153,169,30,109,134,157,62,152,218,110,231,16,70,91,173,241,3,11,114,143,195,8,20,136,158,177,207,243,252,258,42,52,112,208,57,111,161,222,14,49,73,96,99,122,244,178,224,35,184,198,211,257,94,144,168,25,53,64,87,130,234,131,138,146,206,223,44,69,139,209,247,260,18,54,93,185,225,98,126,154,183,33,59,132,167,212,249,255,27,48,60,75,135,148,165,204,210,216,251,119,246,15,36,97,133,188,214,31,137,189,197,253,34,233,172,200,201,217,248,12,74,125,141,22,123,213,259,10,17,72,250,2,32,37,39,116,170,199,142,68,120,155,179,182,28,84,171,180,256,88,127,71,145,229,67,92,221,86,89,187,202,79,83,181,80,128,215,85,121,220,76,66,77,43,124,235,149,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}

The camera may not be able to track the subject's movement quickly enough, resulting in a blurry or distorted image.\n\n2. **Low-light indoor photos**: HDR is designed to enhance contrast and detail in high-contrast scenes. In low-light conditions, the camera's sensitivity is already high, and HDR can introduce noise and graininess, reducing image quality.\n\n3. **When you want to use the flash or the front camera**: HDR mode typically requires the camera to capture multiple exposures, which can interfere with flash synchronization and reduce the effectiveness of flash. Additionally, HDR is not optimized for close-up shots, which are common with the front camera.\n\nHDR mode is best suited for scenarios where you want to capture the full range of brightness and contrast in a scene, such as landscapes with bright skies and shaded areas, outdoor portraits with high contrast, backlit scenes with dark shadows and bright highlights, and when both the camera and subject are stationary.

Its primary purpose is to repair punctures in the tire, particularly those caused by small objects like nails or glass shards. The sealant is designed to fill the hole and seal the puncture, preventing air from escaping and allowing the tire to remain inflated.\n\nThe potential issue it is meant to address is flat tires caused by small punctures. These types of punctures can often go unnoticed by drivers, leading to deflated tires and potentially dangerous driving conditions. By applying the sealant, the tire can be temporarily repaired, allowing the driver to safely drive to a more convenient location for a proper repair or replacement.\n\nThe sealant is typically used in emergency situations where immediate repair is necessary, rather than as a long-term solution. It is designed to provide temporary inflation and allow for safe driving until the tire can be properly serviced. This can be particularly useful in situations where a spare tire is not available or when the driver is far from a service station.","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[490,474,489,478,479,2,4,6,96,256,302,320,588,606,610,620,281,477,491,296,429,488,484,487,466,132,357,480,304,128,310,486,205,440,465,475,492,537,81,483,583,148,241,464,485,543,160,285,383,435,476,517,518,542,571,58,93,138,159,255,283,324,531,146,182,200,204,253,273,297,443,446,471,473,496,529,544,601,35,183,305,412,83,104,113,203,287,392,523,524,545,82,118,582,236,238,306,546,585,17,92,351,564,613,175,289,326,434,16,418,441,535,45,155,494,541,52,80,123,150,196,240,282,342,481,79,149,171,444,470,534,572,36,63,154,247,290,291,463,508,597,131,158,170,224,311,354,457,532,618,37,38,41,54,76,103,439,511,596,53,61,295,396,427,547,575,598,39,89,216,307,308,339,348,404,28,75,108,135,137,141,178,212,507,512,584,586,609,105,153,234,239,268,313,325,386,406,525,46,51,62,124,133,210,303,503,521,563,565,570,86,194,264,366,461,526,43,201,237,344,395,431,533,549,550,60,129,213,233,261,335,402,472,493,528,556,566,587,614,25,42,48,56,161,191,358,454,552,44,78,107,144,151,157,218,249,254,330,387,460,530,8,32,73,115,122,136,177,195,208,280,286,316,423,424,469,522,548,576,70,72,90,125,126,127,143,223,262,275,312,405,426,433,453,455,456,467,515,540,9,22,33,55,87,166,202,235,243,251,279,340,388,428,447,452,538,579,26,30,49,50,67,156,209,219,226,292,294,350,379,536,34,77,130,206,230,231,242,245,259,269,293,355,359,397,468,599,59,88,101,114,119,162,181,186,260,278,284,318,380,410,498,499,520,527,40,57,91,180,192,199,232,267,338,368,369,438,451,482,580,222,363,373,414,442,558,117,142,167,225,227,228,300,378,403,449,568,611,27,84,145,164,276,329,347,409,445,506,10,165,198,220,246,288,337,372,376,381,389,436,450,578,18,31,47,152,334,361,408,589,604,608,617,66,112,139,217,266,364,393,394,577,13,71,121,211,331,375,377,505,513,516,95,120,134,147,248,371,401,559,562,574,169,176,190,197,221,301,336,346,356,370,384,390,398,400,432,495,64,68,85,111,270,332,343,352,422,425,519,569,20,29,274,345,415,560,567,110,140,174,189,214,265,353,407,448,65,69,106,458,497,557,594,602,163,215,244,328,341,539,561,612,184,299,360,437,501,502,514,555,94,179,188,399,419,607,74,116,263,590,272,349,382,553,12,250,271,362,367,430,3,333,416,420,551,554,600,99,229,252,298,365,374,187,315,317,327,385,391,581,24,168,207,591,323,413,417,459,615,172,319,603,98,109,314,421,277,573,185,193,509,11,411,595,500,510,616,100,462,257,7,19,321,592,21,23,309,322,258,97,173,5,102,15,14,504,593,619,605,1],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 5\n","score":5}]}

{"question":"What safety risks might arise from exceeding the roof load capacity of your vehicle, and how can these risks be mitigated?","answer":"","category":"tables","evidence_pages":[249],"raw_output":"","pred":"Exceeding the roof load capacity can lead to several safety risks. Firstly, the vehicle's center of gravity shifts, making it more susceptible to rollovers, especially at higher speeds. This instability can result in loss of control, leading to accidents. Secondly, the weight distribution becomes uneven, which can damage the roof structure and affect the vehicle's overall integrity. Additionally, the roof rack itself may become unstable, increasing the risk of collapse during sudden stops or maneuvers. \n\nTo mitigate these risks, it's crucial to adhere to the specified weight limit of 100 kg (220 lbs) for evenly distributed loads. Ensure that the load is securely fastened to prevent it from shifting during travel. Avoid carrying large, flat items that could extend higher than the front seatbacks, as this could obstruct the sunroof or cause instability. Regularly check the roof rack for signs of wear or damage, and adjust the load distribution as needed to maintain stability. By following these guidelines, you can minimize the safety risks associated with exceeding the roof load capacity.","source":"data/test/carnival_2024.json","annotator":"gemini-1.5-pro-001","generator":"","retrieved_pages":[249,302,482,39,274,312,546,73,319,31,149,280,311,316,80,310,542,13,131,519,306,492,236,258,483,44,148,303,418,541,42,201,301,309,344,263,454,596,94,315,507,547,49,269,307,395,238,479,66,122,444,43,95,281,130,305,617,74,79,481,129,253,317,513,69,88,268,313,318,10,63,116,203,243,275,285,491,514,45,240,548,67,87,198,357,455,51,65,71,92,292,391,486,509,539,549,85,159,220,244,456,495,538,40,61,93,143,218,252,410,493,72,104,150,156,291,398,489,518,544,563,55,84,105,248,267,314,336,442,24,30,48,83,133,283,290,350,390,452,476,494,545,558,7,11,41,111,125,141,183,211,296,400,425,429,578,32,36,90,151,289,293,393,475,485,614,86,175,192,261,304,590,70,147,242,308,618,52,64,110,246,265,327,337,352,91,102,270,349,412,457,565,35,68,155,204,212,427,446,478,570,585,586,8,123,137,196,297,342,468,506,537,584,17,53,181,227,230,351,355,359,423,571,81,219,341,420,37,108,127,282,472,499,521,572,9,23,234,295,445,461,54,56,103,114,247,260,273,330,335,419,467,616,12,29,33,144,146,262,430,526,28,46,57,135,166,241,255,294,324,326,333,356,358,413,451,470,560,561,58,134,200,228,232,251,325,415,473,474,508,532,533,615,3,107,205,362,428,440,490,59,213,366,424,527,82,142,145,158,233,286,339,367,530,552,564,573,199,371,374,381,414,453,480,577,579,613,76,132,138,161,165,299,361,363,372,543,555,587,157,162,194,237,354,380,465,554,47,75,124,152,195,197,284,360,365,394,435,463,471,575,38,98,189,193,458,528,553,106,128,209,259,264,345,385,417,431,441,466,525,50,185,208,271,343,524,153,154,223,331,397,477,557,569,589,598,16,34,60,89,117,184,215,332,411,551,595,97,113,300,383,396,406,448,531,534,535,550,26,27,160,408,556,112,115,364,416,520,574,62,119,266,272,276,288,402,422,433,503,540,599,109,182,239,254,329,369,469,522,576,188,328,340,386,421,484,529,593,609,78,179,225,277,399,426,121,338,379,392,401,77,177,186,206,278,334,370,387,405,443,568,99,171,377,436,459,464,515,523,298,403,432,488,18,384,388,487,517,608,100,120,163,174,190,217,348,368,597,126,178,210,226,323,437,176,229,376,450,612,222,224,373,382,536,1,25,118,136,139,231,287,404,245,566,581,216,257,279,347,375,434,449,498,378,594,180,511,600,605,191,580,592,167,221,438,439,496,559,346,389,407,447,582,172,202,321,173,214,168,170,187,207,583,21,235,353,504,505,567,601,604,20,22,250,462,502,501,460,497,101,169,2,4,6,19,96,256,320,512,562,588,606,610,620,15,164,611,140,500,603,409,602,322,5,516,619,14,591,510,607],"judgements":[{"name":"azure","content":"5","score":5},{"name":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620","content":"Correctness: 5","score":5},{"name":"gemini-1.5-pro-002","content":"Correctness: 4\n","score":4}]}
